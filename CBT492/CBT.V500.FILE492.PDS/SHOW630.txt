*       SHOWMVS can be invoked as a program, as a TSO command, or     *
*       as an edit macro and can run authorized or non-authorized.    *
*       Some of the displays are only produced when SHOWMVS runs      *
*       authorized.                                                   *
*       SHOWMVS should run in hard-copy mode under CICS. ShowMvs      *
*       can't be run native under CICS you need to use a simple       *
*       stub which is available from Roland@schiradin.de              *
*                                                                     *
*---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*                                                                     *
*     Compatibility                                                   *
*                                                                     *
*       SHOWMVS supports MVS/XA 2.2, MVS/ESA 3.1.3, 4.1, 4.2,         *
*       4.2.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.2.2, and OS/390 R1 through R10.    *
*       SHOWMVS assembles and executes in any of these environments.  *
*                                                                     *
*       At the object level, SHOWMVS is fully downward-compatible     *
*       and partially up-ward compatible.  This means the following:  *
*       If SHOWMVS has been assembled on an MVS system at level n,    *
*       it will be fully compatible with any older MVS system.        *
*       The same object code, however, will generally execute on      *
*       newer systems, but with reduced functionality.                *
*                                                                     *
*       For example, SHOWMVS assembled on an ESA 4.3 system and       *
*       running on an ESA 4.1 system will produce the same output     *
*       as if it had been assembled on an 4.1 system.  If the same    *
*       object executes on an ESA 5.2 system, however, it will not    *
*       produce the same output as if the same SHOWMVS source had     *
*       been assembled on the 5.2 system on which it is run.          *
*                                                                     *
*       If you intend to run SHOWMVS on different MVS levels,         *
*       make sure you assemble it on the most recent one.             *
*                                                                     *
*       SHOWMVS requires the following levels of the STRING macro:    *
*                                                                     *
*       o  R403 for MVS/XA (STRINGXA)                                 *
*       o  R507 for MVS/ESA and OS/390                                *
*                                                                     *
*       These two levels of STRING are not compatible.                *
*       SHOWMVS assembled with STRING R507 will not run on MVS/XA.    *
*       SHOWMVS assembled with STRINGXA will not run authorized       *
*               on MVS/ESA                                            *
*                                                                     *
*---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*                                                                     *
*     Output Modes                                                    *

*       SHOWMVS provides five output modes.                           *
*                                                                     *
*       1. BROWSE (using BRIF)                                        *
*                                                                     *
*       This is the default mode when running in ISPF.                *
*                                                                     *
*       2. EDIT (using EDIF)                                          *
*                                                                     *
*       This mode is used when invoked in TSO on-line with ISPF via   *
*       PGM(SHOWMVS) PARM(EDIT) or CMD(SHOWMVS EDIT).                 *
*       Note that EDIT mode is actually VIEW, i.e there is no SAVE    *
*       capability (CREATE and REPLACE can be used to save the data,  *
*       EDIT macros can also be used).                                *
*                                                                     *
*       3. SHORT_PUTLINE
*                                                                     *
*       This is the default mode when running in TSO/E without ISPF.  *
*       In this mode, SHOWMVS clears the screen and produces the      *
*       first two displays (System Level and IPL)                     *
*                                                                     *
*       4. PUTLINE (using PUTLINE)                                    *
*                                                                     *
*       This mode is used under TSO when SHOWMVS is invoked as a      *
*       program with PARM(PUTLINE) or as a command with the PUTLINE   *
*       parameter.  This mode is useful if you want to use the        *
*       OUTTRAP function to process the output of SHOWMVS.            *
*                                                                     *
*       5. HARD-COPY (using QSAM)                                     *
*                                                                     *
*       In Hard-copy mode, SHOWMVS writes the output to a QSAM DCB    *
*       with RECFM=FBA,LRECL=121 instead of displaying it on the      *
*       terminal.  Hard-copy mode is automatically activated in the   *
*       following circumstances:                                      *
*                                                                     *
*         1. SHOWMVS runs outside of the TSO/E environment.           *
*            If no //SHOWMVS DD is present in the JCL, SHOWMVS        *
*            allocates one with SYSOUT=*.                             *
*                                                                     *
*         2. SHOWMVS runs in an on-line TSO/ISPF environment,         *
*            and a //SHOWMVS DD is currently allocated to the         *
*            TSO session.                                             *
*                                                                     *
*       SHOWMVS output is in lower case. If you want to print it      *
*       in upper case, you must invoke SHOWMVS with the CAPS          *
*       parameter.                                                    *
*                                                                     *
*       6. TCPIP mode                                                 *
*                                                                     *
*       There are a TCPIP-mode available. Unfortunally we never       *
*       made this public because the client-program (receiver) is     *
*       very very simple, but can be run under MVS and NT.            *
*       This code of ShowMvs doesn't include this feature but         *
*       might be a subject of change. Just ask for it!!!              *
*       We are open for some users to jump into this                  *
*                                                                     *
*    Dynamic Displays                                                 *
*                                                                     *
*       When MODE=BRIF is used, some of the displays produced by      *
*       SHOWMVS are dynamic, i.e. they are refreshed each time the    *
*       user hits the ENTER key or enters any of the scroll commands. *
*       The dynamic displays are:                                     *
*                                                                     *
*       o  GTF Status                                                 *

*      Whether SHOWMVS is authorized or not depends on how it has     *
*      been installed and in which environment it executes.           *
*                                                                     *
*      1. If SHOWMVS runs as an APF-authorized job step (authorized   *
*         library and AC=1), then it is authorized.                   *
*                                                                     *
*      2. If SHOWMVS is defined as an authorized TSO/E command or     *
*         program (e.g. in IKJTSOxx) and is invoked as such in a      *
*         batch or on-line TSO/E environment, then it is authorized.  *
*         Note that ISPF services are not available to authorized     *
*         TSO/E commands.                                             *
*                                                                     *
*      3. SHOWMVS is link-edited in such a way that it can take       *
*         advantage of the SDSF SVC.  All of the following condi-     *
*         tions must be met:                                          *
*                                                                     *
*         o The load-library is APF-authorized                        *
*                                                                     *
*         o The name of the load-module starts with "ISF"             *
*           (if you want to invoke it under the name "SHOWMVS",       *
*           define it as an alias)                                    *
*                                                                     *
*         o The load-module is marked RENT                            *
*                                                                     *
*         o SDSF V1R3, V1R4 or V1R5 is installed on the system        *
*                                                                     *
*         o You need to excplicit specify the <lib> on your TSO       *
*           CALL command even this <lib> can be accessed via          *
*           regular ISPF/TSO search features                          *
*                                                                     *
*         In this case, and in this case only, will SHOWMVS be        *
*         able to invoke BRIF (or EDIF) and access authorized         *
*         functions at the same time.                                 *
*                                                                     *
*    Note on SDSF V1R6:                                               *
*                                                                     *
*      Starting with HQX1600, the SDSF SVC checks the full name of    *
*      the invoker which *must* be ISFINIT; previous versions only    *
*      check the first three characters of the name.                  *
*                                                                     *
*      To use the SDSF V1R6 SVC with SHOWMVS, do as follows:          *
*                                                                     *
*      1. link SHOWMVS into an APF-authorized library under the       *
*         name ISFINIT; do not define SHOWMVS as an alias.            *
*                                                                     *
*      2. create a CLIST (or REXX EXEC) called SHOWMVS:               *
*                                                                     *
*           CALL '-dsname-(ISFINIT)'                                  *
*                                                                     *
*      3. invoke SHOWMVS by typing  TSO %SHOWMVS                      *
*                                                                     *

*    As SHOWMVS is enhanced to support additional functions,          *
*    it uses an increasing number of undocumented interfaces          *
*    and control blocks, many of them OCO.  This is required          *
*    to provide full support for recently introduced features,        *
*    such as Dynamic UCBs, CDE Extension, TSO/E tables, etc.          *
*                                                                     *
*    Besides the initial difficulty to understand them, which in      *
*    itself can be a source of problems, the format, contents, or     *
*    chaining method of undocumented control blocks may change in     *
*    future releases (or when PTFs are applied) and erroneous         *
*    results may occur (S0C4 is the most likely symptom).             *
*                                                                     *

*        displayed on the screen, i.e when you scroll UP, DOWN,       *
*        LEFT, RIGHT, or simply hit ENTER.                            *

*        first screen without any delay while volume and vtoc         *
*        information (which require i/o) is obtained for the          *
*        link-list, lpa-list and apf-list displays.                   *
*                                                                     *
*        When the user scrolls to these screens (which takes a few    *
*        seconds), volume and vtoc information will have been obtained*
*        in the background, without the user having to wait.          *
*                                                                     *
*        If a speedy user chains a "find" command to the invocation   *
*        of this program (by issuing "tso showmvs;f lpa-list" for     *
*        example), then he/she will probably get a bunch of question  *
*        marks instead of volume and vtoc information (surprise,      *
*        surprise !!).  After a few seconds of hesitation, this user  *
*        is likely to hit "enter" or scroll (up or down) to see if    *
*        other bizarre things happen, which leaves enough time to the *
*        subtask to finish obtaining the information and replace the  *
*        question marks with pertinent data.                          *

*        If your primary JES2 is not in sync with the HASMxxxx        *
*        modules in SYS1.MIGLIB or SYS1.SHASMIG, this routine         *
*        won't work.  To fix this, you can do the following:          *
*                                                                     *
*        1. Locate the following instruction:                         *
*             LOAD EPLOC=(R8),DCB=(R1),ERRET=RC12                     *
*           change it to:                                             *
*             LOAD EPLOC=(R8),DCB=0,ERRET=RC12                        *
*           then assemble and link SHOWMVS.                           *
*                                                                     *
*        2. Go to the MVS system where JES2 was installed (it should  *
*           have been installed under SMP/E).  Get the HASMHCCT,      *
*           HASMSJB and HASMPIT modules from SYS1.MIGLIB (or          *
*           SYS1.SHASMIG) on that system; they should be in sync with *
*           your primary JES2 (you can check that by BROWSEing them). *
*           Copy these modules to a STEPLIB or ISPLLIB library.       *
*                                                                     *
* CHANGE ACTIVITY                                                     *
*                                                                     *
