 | Name: %SHOWMENU
 |
 | Author: David Alcock

 |
 | Purpose: Invoke SHOWMVS in "EDIT" mode so we can run SHOWMVSM (menu)
 |          as an edit macro.  It's the best (but not only) way to
 |          use the SHOWMVSM edit macro.
 |
 | Invocation: %SHOWMENU
 |
 | Note: This only works if you put the % before SHOWMVS of course.
