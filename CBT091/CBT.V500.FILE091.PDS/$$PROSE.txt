               USE ALL OF THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK, NATURALLY!
                 *************************************

            THIS IS A FILE OF THE JCL PROCEDURES FOR USE WITH 3 OTHER
           FILES I HAVE DONATED. BEING AN OS/MVT PERSON (WHEN THINGS
           WERE FREE) I SAVED THE 360 VERSION OF FORTRAN-G AND PL1-F.
           THEN ALONG WITH FORTRAN G IS THE GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
           VERSION OF FORTRAN-H (THIS IS NOT FORTRAN-H-EXTENDED). THIS
           IS ALL FREE SOFTWARE AND WORKS FINE IN THE MVS WORLD. I HAD
           BEEN TOLD THAT PL1F DOESN'T FUNCTION IN THE MVS-XA WORLD
           (BUT NOW THE VERSION ON FILE 092 DOES WORK ON XA AND ESA.
           IT WAS FIXED BY LARRY WILLIAMS, WHO RE-LINKEDITED IT, AND
           EXPANDED EVERY CSECT BY EIGHT BYTES, SO THE LINKAGE EDITOR
           COULD "RETHINK" HOW IT PUT THINGS TOGETHER).  ALSO, I
           EXTRACTED RPG FROM THE FINAL RELEASE OF OS/MVT AND PUT
           IT INTO A FILE.  THIS IS NOW ON FILE 327 OF THE CBT TAPE.
           THE RPG LOAD MODULES HAVE BEEN RE-LINKEDITED USING THE
           DFSMS BINDER BY SAM GOLOB.

           THE 3 FILES ARE BUILT AS FOLLOWS:

FILE 092   PL1FLOAD - THIS CONTAINS THE COMPILER AND LIBRARY FOR PL1F.
                      IN ITS CURRENT FORM ON FILE 092, IT WILL
                      WORK IN MVS/XA, AND IN MVS/ESA.


FILE 326   FORTLOAD - THIS CONTAINS THE COMPILERS FOR FORTRAN G & H.
                      ALSO THERE IS THE FORTRAN LIBRARY FOR BOTH OF
                      THEM (SYS1.FORTLIB).  THIS IS ON FILE 326 OF
                      THE CBT TAPE, AND IN ITS CURRENT FORM, HAS BEEN
                      RE-LINKEDITED BY RICK FOCHTMAN, WHO INTRODUCED
                      IDR RECORDS IN EACH CSECT TELLING YOU IF IT WAS
                      FORTRAN G, H, OR WHATEVER.

                      REGULAR FORTRAN HAS THE 'STAE' ROUTINE CALLED
                      IHOSTAE. WELL GODDARD'S VERSION HAS GSFSTAE
                      WHICH MUST BE AVAILABLE AT RUNTIME. MY ADVICE
                      IS TO STEPLIB TO THE ENTIRE LIBRARY AT RUN
                      TIME.

                      SCOTT VETTERS (MICHIGAN MUTUAL) SAYS THE FORTG
                      COMPILER IS RUNNING ON HIS MVS/XA 2.1.2 SYSTEM.
                      (313) 827-7400 EXT 336

                      I HAVE FORTG RUNNING ON MVS/XA 2.2.0 WITH NO
                      PROBLEMS.


FILE 327   RPGLOAD  - THIS CONTAINS THE DLIB AND COMPILER LIBRARY FOR
                      THE OS/MVT VERSION OF RPG. THE JOB CALLED
                      'RPG$GEN' IS THE EXTRACTED LINKEDIT CARDS FROM
                      AN OS/MVT SYSGEN FOR LINKING ALL THE RPG
                      COMPILER MODULES (FOR YOUR INFO). INCLUDED IS
                      A SAMPLE JOB TO TEST IT. (IT WORKS ON AN
                      MVS/ESA 4.3 SYSTEM.)  THIS IS ON FILE 327
                      OF THE CBT TAPE.


            NOTES: YOU CAN FIND OUT ALL THE DEFAULTS BY EXECUTING
                   THE COMPILERS WITH A PARM=   AND LOOK AT WHAT
                   IS SET. HAVE FUN, SO NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO
                   IGNORE SOME OF THE MORE INTERESTING (IF YOU KNOW
                   WHAT I MEAN) PROGRAMS ON THE MODS TAPES WRITTEN
                   IN PL1F OR FORTRAN!! (LOOK TO THE HEAVENS)
