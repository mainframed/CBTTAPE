This is the SOURCE library for Jeff Kaplan's collection of software.

This collection is currently in the condition of 'hodge-podge',
however, there is much useful material here.

    File 252 contains Jeff Kaplan's   SOURCE   library
    File 253 contains Jeff Kaplan's   EXEC     library
    File 254 contains Jeff Kaplan's   CNTL     library
    File 255 contains Jeff Kaplan's   ISPPLIB  library
    File 256 contains Jeff Kaplan's   ISPTLIB  library

Nothing is GUARANTEED to work anywhere else.  The user will have to
-------
              "look and try".......    However, there is much good
              code in this collection, including numerous direct
              calls to SVC 26.

   I am (sort of) an intermediary between Jeff Kaplan and the public.
However, his direct work phone is:  215-633-4614.

   If you can't reach Jeff at work, please try:

Note:  Jeff's CNTL library also contains Assembler Source and REXX
       execs.  Please explore ALL files in this collection.  As of
       this cut of the tape, I have not sifted through all of Jeff's
       stuff and straightened it out.  There may also be some
       duplication of source code or REXX execs.
