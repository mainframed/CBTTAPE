 INTRODUCTION
 ____________



 The Time Sharing Subsystem Option (TSSO) is a package designed to
 increase operator productivity by automating tasks which need not
 be performed manually. TSSO performs its function  through  three
 integrated  components.  The Operator Productivity Facility (OPF)
 extends the power of TSO to the MVS operator's console.  The  Au-
 tomated  Operations  Facility  (AOF)  enhances  an installation's
 ability to control system events based on console  message  traf-
 fic.   An interface to the Network Communication Control Facility
 (NCCF) allows the network operator  to  use  TSSO  as  a  command
 processor, issuing and receiving operating system commands at the
 NCCF  terminal.   TSSO also enhances end-user productivity by al-
 lowing end-user access to the MVS command subsystem.  This  docu-
 ment describes the installation of TSSO, TSSO parameters, and the
 use of the three components.

 PLANNING FOR TSSO INSTALLATION
 ______________________________



 Because TSSO has grown in function  and  complexity,  a  planning
 section  is  now necessary to describe pre-requisite program pro-
 ducts, MVS I/O generation requirements, and security system  con-
 ditioning.    This  section  should  be  reviewed  PRIOR  to  the
 installation of TSSO.

 TSSO 4.3 was developed for Bellcore internal use  as  part  of  a
 study  on automating the operation of an MVS computer center. Be-
 cause the kernal of TSSO was  originally  developed  external  to
 Bellcore, permission was granted to make this new version of TSSO
 available as public domain, unsupported software. As a public do-
 main  software  package,  TSSO  receives  no  formal support from
 Bellcore or anyone else.  Therefore, installations that  want  to
 use  TSSO  must be prepared to support it locally as a worst case
 possibility. Questions, comments or enhancement requests are  al-
 ways welcome on an informal, non-committal basis.



 TSSO SOFTWARE PREREQUISITES
 ___________________________


 The  software  listed below is the minimum version of the program
 product required to run TSSO. In  general,  that  version,  or  a
 later  release,  is sufficient. Also listed is the version of the
 product run at Bell Communications Research (i.e.,  the  environ-
 ment on which TSSO 4.3 was developed).

 1.  MVS/SP  1.3.3  OR  MVS/XA  2.1.1 is required for the OCCF en-
     ________________________________
     hancements to the subsystem interface that allow TSSO/AOF and
     the OS family of commands to function.  TSSO  4.3  has  never
     been  run  on  earlier  MVS  releases.   Bellcore runs MVS/XA
     2.1.3, and TSSO has also been tested on MVS/SP 1.3.4.

 2.  TSO/E RELEASE 2 is required by the  OS  family  of  commands.
     _______________
     These  commands use CLIST variables for input and output, and
     require the CLIST enhancements of TSO/E Release 2  to  accom-
     plish  this. TSO/E is not required if these commands will not
     be used.  Bellcore runs TSO/E Release 2.1, and TSSO has  also
     been tested with TSO/E Release 2.

 3.  RACF  1.6  is  required for the TSSO/RACF security interface.
     _________
     TSSO has  never  been  run  on  previous  releases  of  RACF.



 PLANNING FOR TSSO INSTALLATION                                  4









     Bellcore  runs RACF 1.7, and TSSO 4.3 has been tested only in
     that environment.

 4.  ACF2 4.1 is the release on which TSSO/ACF2 interface is being
     ________
     developed.



 TSSO SUBSYSTEM CONSOLE
 ______________________


 The OSCMD facility allows a TSO CLIST to issue an operating  sys-
 tem  command  and retrieve the response. This facility requires a
 subsystem console for every simultaneous caller of OSCMD.  In ad-
 dition, an installation may want to dedicate one  subsystem  con-
 sole for  the  TSSO  address  space.(1)  To  create  a  subsystem
 console, include the following card after the "CONSOLE" macros in
 the MVS STAGE1 generation deck.

   CONSOLE    TYPE=JES

 Because TSSO 4.3 can use as many subsystem consoles as are genned
 in,  it  is  a  good idea to include many (10-20) of these cards.
 (Bellcore has 10 subsystem  consoles  genned  in.)    JES3  shops
 should  note  that JES3 and TSSO both require subsystem consoles,
 and you specify them accordingly.  AN MVS IOGEN MUST BE PERFORMED
 TO GENERATE THE SUBSYSTEM CONSOLE.  INSTALLATIONS  FAMILIAR  WITH
 THE "MINIGEN" APPROACH MAY USE THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE.



 TSSO SECURITY ISSUES
 ____________________


 An optional feature of TSSO 4.3 is the ability to secure your MVS
 consoles.    Console  security requires MVS operators to identify
 themselves before issuing commands; thus, MVS  installations  al-
 ways  know  which  operators  issue which commands. The following
 steps should be taken prior to initializing TSSO with a  security
 level other than "minimal".




 ----------------

 1   For  more information on this option, see "NUMCONS Parameter"
     on page 12.


 PLANNING FOR TSSO INSTALLATION                                  5









 1.  Provide  a RACF user ID for each operator who will be issuing
     MVS commands on the system. This includes the master console,
     I/O console(s) and user consoles.

 2.  Add a corresponding user ID to the User Attributes  Data  Set
     (UADS),  and set the USERDATA bits to X'C0' for operators who
     will be invoking the privileged TSSO commands  (e.g.,  REPLY,
     OSCMD  etc.).    Note that the USERDATA bits also control au-
     thority for regular TSO users, and, if  the  Program  Control
     Facility  (PCF)  is  installed,  the OSCMD and REPLY commands
     must be modified so that PCF and TSSO don't  conflict.    See
     "Authority Checking with OSCMD" on page 22 for information on
     the OSCMDATH user exit.

 3.  Pick  a security level. SECLEVEL=MEDIAL is a good initial se-
     lection, as operators can get used to the concept of  logging
     on  and logging off of an MVS console. Later, security can be
     strengthened with SECLEVEL=MAXIMAL.

 4.  Select a TIMEOUT parameter. This parameter is the  number  of
     minutes  before  which  an MVS console will "timeout" and re-
     quire a new LOGON command.

 5.  As with the rest of TSSO, operator training is CRUCIAL for  a
                                                    _______
     successful  implementation.  Operators  must  become familiar
     with the concepts of security.

 6.  ACF2 will eventually be supported under TSSO.   For the  cur-
     rent status of this effort, call Jim Lane, 416-926-3076.

 CONCLUSION
 __________


 The remainder of this guide should be read IN ITS ENTIRETY before
 installing  TSSO.   Many of the phone calls I've received on TSSO
 were answered in the TSSO USER'S GUIDE.  Good luck in  your  TSSO

 PLANNING FOR TSSO INSTALLATION                                  7









 INSTALLATION
 ____________



 TSSO  is distributed in a single partitioned data set, which con-
 tains all source modules, procedures and documentation.  Although
 the data set may be called by any name, this document  assumes  a
 name of TSSO.VERS43.ASM.

 1.  Download  the TSSO.VERS43.ASM data set to DASD.  About 5 cyl-
     inders of 3380 space is required.  If you received your  copy
     of  the TSSO subsystem from the CBT tape, simply copy it to a
     data set with this name.  If you received a  tape,  then  the
     TSSO  subsystem  is in IEBCOPY format on the first file.  The
     tape will be non-labeled, so use the  LABEL=(1,NL)  parameter
     when downloading TSSO.

 2.  Create two data sets for the TSSO modules with the character-
     istics RECFM=U, LRECL=0, BLKSIZE=13030, DSORG=PO.

     a.  TSSO.VERS43.LOAD will be an intermediate data set for as-
         sembling TSSO modules.

     b.  SYS1.TSSOLOAD will contain the TSSO production modules.

     One  cylinder  of  3380  DASD  space should be sufficient for
     these data sets.

     Many users have found it useful to allocate a third data set:

     c.  SYS1.TSSOPROC will contain TSSO CLISTs.  Allocate it with
         characteristics   LRECL=255,   BLKSIZE=3140,    RECFM=VB,
         DSORG=PO.    Space  requirements  depend on the number of
         CLISTs you anticipate creating.

 3.  Assemble the TSSO source modules using the  procedure  ASMALL
     in  TSSO.VERS43.ASM.  You will need to EDIT the procedure and
     add the appropriate installation job cards and local account-
     ing information.

     If you will be running the TSSO subsystem on MVS/370, or both
     MVS/370 and MVS/XA, the SYSLIB DD statement must be  pointing
     to the SYS1.MACLIB and SYS1.AMODGEN data sets for MVS/370. If
     you  will be running the subsystem exclusively on MVS/XA, the
     SYSLIB  DD  statement  may  point  to  the  XA  versions   of
     SYS1.MACLIB and SYS1.AMODGEN.




 INSTALLATION                                                    8









     NOTE: If  you  do not have TSO/E Release 2 installed, the as-
     semblies for OSCMD, OSWAIT, and OSASK will fail.

 4.  Copy the load modules from  TSSO.VERS43.LOAD  into  the  pro-
     duction  library SYS1.TSSOLOAD.  The library TSSO.VERS43.LOAD
     should remain on the system as  an  intermediate  library  to
     contain  assembled  TSSO load modules and assembled Automated
     Operations Facility tables.

 5.  If OSCMD, OSWAIT, OSPAUSE, OSWTO, and OSWTOH will be accessed
     by TSO users,  copy  the  modules  from  SYS1.TSSOLOAD  to  a
     publicly-accessible TSO command library (e;g;, SYS1,CMDLIB).

 6.  Update the SYS1.PARMLIB data set with one or more TSSO param-
     eter  decks.  The default member is TSSOPARM; however, alter-
     nate members may be selected when TSSO is started.  Note that
     the TSSO parameter decks MUST be located in SYS1.PARMLIB,  as
                              ____
     TSSO  will  dynamically  allocate this data set.   Review the
     section "TSSO PARAMETERS" on page 11 for further information.
     A sample TSSO parameter deck may be found in member  SAMPPARM
     in TSSO.VERS43.ASM data set.

 7.  Identify TSSO to MVS as a subsystem.  Make one of the follow-
     ing two entries in the subsystem names table, member IEFSSNxx
                                                                __
     in SYS1.PARMLIB:

     +-------------------+----------------------+----------------+
     |  If you want:     |  then make the entry:|  and:          |
     +-------------------+----------------------+----------------+
     |  NO JES support   |  TSSO                |  go to Step 9. |
     |                   |                      |                |
     |  JES support      |  TSSO,TSSOINIT       |  go to Step 8. |
     +-------------------+----------------------+----------------+

 8.  Copy TSSOINIT from SYS1.TSSOLOAD to SYS1.LINKLIB.

 9.  Include SYS1.TSSOLOAD in the IEAAPFxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB.
                                        __
     This allows the TSSO subsystem to run APF authorized.

 10. Include  a  TSSO  start-up procedure in the SYS1.PROCLIB data
     set.  Note that, because TSSO may be started  by  the  master
     scheduler,  this  procedure must be in SYS1.PROCLIB, not in a
     PROCLIB defined to JES2.   A sample  procedure  for  starting
     TSSO is in member TSSOPROC in the TSSO.VERS43.ASM data set.

 11. Give  the  TSO commands supplied with TSSO APF authorization.
     Update  the  installation  CSECT  IKJEFTE2  in  load   module
     IKJEFT02  to  include the following commands:  ALTAOF, CACHE,


 INSTALLATION                                                    9









     CPCMD, REPLY, OSCMD, OSWTO, OSWTOH, OSWAIT, and OSASK.  Under
     TSO/E Release 2.1, this CSECT is in the load module IKJTABLS.
     If this release of TSO/E is installed,  a  separate  copy  of
     IKJTABLS may be used by TSSO if included in the SYS1.TSSOLOAD
     data set.

 12. Create  the TSSO Automated Operations Facility table(s).  In-
     structions for preparing the table are found  later  in  this
     document.

 13. Copy  the  ASMTAB  CLIST from the TSSO.VERS43.ASM data set to
     SYS1.TSSOPROC.

 14. If you will be running TSSO with RACF support and MINIMAL se-
     curity, add a RACF ID for TSSO.  Also add a RACF ID for  TSSO
     to  SYS1.UADS.  This will allow TSSO to assume the TSO attri-
     butes (e.g. ACCOUNT, SUBMIT or MOUNT) that  the  installation
     desires.  If you will be running with MEDIAL or MAXIMAL secu-
     rity,  you  may  wish  to add additional RACF or ACF2 and TSO
     user IDs for each operator who will be logging on.

 15. IPL MVS to refresh the subsystem name table.

 16. If the OSCMD facility will be used, you must  have  generated
     subsystem  consoles  as specified in "TSSO Subsystem Console"
     on page 5.  TSSO will warn you if  the  number  of  subsystem
     consoles requested is not available at start time.

 17. Install  the  NCCF Interface (optional).  The following steps
     are required:

     a.  Copy the NCFOSCMD module into a library  concatenated  to
         the  STEPLIB DD  statement in the procedure used to start
         NCCF.

     b.  Make the following entry in member DSICMD of the data set
         defined by the DSIPARM DD statement in the procedure used

 TSSO PARAMETERS
 _______________



 TSSO parameters provide an installation with a flexible mechanism
 for altering TSSO processing.  Parameters are stored  as  members
 in  SYS1.PARMLIB.   The default member is TSSOPARM, and it is re-
 commended that a TSSOPARM be created for daily processing.

 Parameters can be entered in any order, and if  two  entries  are
 specified  for  the  same parameter, the last entry takes preced-
 ence.  See the SAMPPARM member of TSSO.VERS43.ASM.



 MAXCMDS PARAMETER
 _________________


 MAXCMDS defines the maximum number of  concurrent  commands  that
 TSSO  will  hold for processing.   TSSO processes commands in the
 order in which they are entered, on a  first in-first out  basis.
 Any  commands  that  are entered while TSSO is processing another
 command are queued for execution.  The MAXCMDS parameter  defines
 the  size  of that queue.   Too small a number is undesirable be-
 cause it is advantageous to be able to enter many  TSSO  commands
 at a time.  Too large a number is also undesirable because it be-
 comes  difficult  to detect when a TSSO command may be looping or
 awaiting terminal input.  The syntax is

   MAXCMDS=nn
           __

 where nn defines the maximum number  of  simultaneous  TSSO  com-
       __
 mands.  Note that TSSO requires 256 bytes for each command in the
 common  service area (CSA).  The default value is 15 simultaneous
 commands.



 MAXWTO PARAMETER
 ________________


 MAXWTO defines the maximum number of WTOs TSSO will issue for any
 given TSO command.  The parameter is designed to prevent  console
 flooding  with  TSO  commands  that produce many lines of output.
 The syntax is

   MAXWTO=nnn
          ___



 TSSO PARAMETERS                                                11









 where nnn is the maximum number of WTOs TSSO will allow  for  any
       ___
 one  command.    TSSO will issue a message when this limit is ex-
 ceeded.  Default is 250.



 NONSWAP PARAMETER
 _________________


 NONSWAP defines whether TSSO will run non-swappable.   If "Y"  is
 entered,  TSSO  will issue the appropriate SYSEVENT to MVS to de-
 clare itself non-swappable.  Any other entry will cause  TSSO  to
 be  swapped  out  whenever it has no work.  This can cause SEVERE
                                                            ______
 performance degradation when using the subsystem.    The  default
 value is "Y".  The syntax is

   NONSWAP=ÝY/N¨

 where "Y" will mark the TSSO address space non-swappable.



 NUMCONS PARAMETER
 _________________


 NUMCONS  defines the number of subsystem consoles for the instal-
 lation.  Optionally, you may dedicate one subsystem  console  for
 the TSSO address space.  The syntax is

   NUMCONS=nn ÝDEDICATE¨
           __

 where  nn  is  the number of consoles.  If DEDICATE is specified,
        __
 one console will be dedicated for the TSSO address space.    Note
 that  at  least nn subsystem consoles must have been generated in
                 __
 the MVS IOGEN prior to starting TSSO.  Default is 1 console, none
 dedicated.



 PROMPT PARAMETER
 ________________


 PROMPT defines whether or not the operator will be  prompted  for
 additional TSSO parameters at start-up time.  The syntax is

   PROMPT=ÝY/N¨




 TSSO PARAMETERS                                                12









 If PROMPT=Y is specified, TSSO will enter prompt mode after proc-
 essing  all  the parameters in PARMLIB and allow the MVS operator
 to enter or override parameters (except security-related  parame-
 ters).   For example, if you want a different AOF table used each
 day, you would want to be prompted so that you can enter the  TA-
 BLE parameter.

 NOTE: Prompt  mode  may  also be specified at start-up time.  See
 the next section for more information.



 RACFID PARAMETER
 ________________


 RACFID defines a default RACF ID for the TSSO subsystem, allowing
 TSSO to access data sets with the  authority  of  that  RACF  ID.
 This  implies that RACF commands can be entered from the MVS con-
 sole through the use of TSSO.  If the installation  has  not  in-
 stalled the RACF program product, this parameter must be omitted.
 The syntax is

   RACFID=RACF-id
          _______

 where RACF-id is the RACF identifier that TSSO will assume.  This
       _______
 parameter  has no default. If it is not specified, TSSO will exe-
 cute with the default RACF authority.

 RACFID  is   dependent   on   the   SECLEVEL   parameter.      If
 SECLEVEL=MINIMAL,  then the RACFID authority level applies to any
 TSO command issued through TSSO.  If SECLEVEL=MEDIAL or  MAXIMAL,
 then  the RACFID authority level applies to CONSOLE 0 and any TSO
 command issued from a subsystem console through OSCMD.  Note that
 TSSO requires that subsystem consoles issuing  commands  have  at
 least "SYSTEM" authority.

 CAUTION:   TSSO  does not require a password to acquire this RACF
            authority, and care must be taken to ensure  that  use
            of  this parameter does not violate installation secu-
            rity standards.

 A recent small programming enhancement (SPE) to the JES2  subsys-
 tem  has enhanced TSSO's ability to control production batch jobs
 that may use RACF-protected data sets.  JES2 will  now  propagate
 the  RACF  ID  and  group from the current address space for jobs
 submitted through the internal reader.  TSSO can submit jobs  us-
 ing  the  TSO  SUBMIT command, and those jobs can acquire the au-
 thority of the TSSO address space.


 TSSO PARAMETERS                                                13









 SECLEVEL PARAMETER
 __________________


 SECLEVEL defines the security level of  the  installation.    The
 syntax is

   SECLEVEL=ÝMINIMAL/MEDIAL/MAXIMAL¨

      MINIMAL        Default  for RACF and TOP SECRET.  The RACFID
                     parameter is used to determine TSSO's author-
                     ity level.  Therefore, all TSO commands  will
                     execute  with TSSO's authority, regardless of
                     the console's authority level.

      MEDIAL         This level requires all consoles  using  TSSO
                     to log on(2) using the  appropriate  security
                     system (RACF, TOP SECRET, or ACF2).  All data
                     set  access  checking  for  TSSO commands and
                     CLISTs is based on the console's logon ID au-
                     thority.   Note that this  does  not  include
                     TSSO control commands, which follow a differ-
                     ent authorization mechanism.

      MAXIMAL        This  level  is extremely restrictive.   Once
                     TSSO is initialized, all consoles must log on
                     using the appropriate security system.    ANY
                     CONSOLE THAT DOES NOT LOG ON IS LOCKED OUT OF
                     ALL MVS COMMANDS.



 SECSYS PARAMETER
 ________________


 SECSYS defines the security system used by the installation.  The
 syntax is

   SECSYS=ÝRACF/ACF2/TOPS¨

 The default is RACF.




 ----------------

 2   Using  the  #.LOGON command, which will assign each console a
     separate RACFID parameter.


 TSSO PARAMETERS                                                14









 SUBSYS PARAMETER
 ________________


 SUBSYS  defines  subsystem  interface exits and the routines that
 will handle the exit functions.  The syntax is

   SUBSYS nn=module-name
          __ ___________

 where nn is the subsystem interface function code and module-name
       __                                              ___________
 is the name of the routine that will handle the  function.    You
 may  specify  as  many SUBSYS parameters as desired.  However, if
 there are multiple entries with the same function code, only  the
 last appearance of the code will be honored.

 By  default,  TSSO  includes two SUBSYS entries, one for function
 code 9 which intercepts WTO messages (the AOF facility)  and  one
 for  function code 10 which intercepts operator commands (the OPF
 facility).  Therefore, be careful that you do not enter a  SUBSYS
 parameter  with  code 9 or 10; otherwise, your entries will over-
 ride the defaults and disable the AOF and OPF facilities.



 SYSTEM RECOGNITION CHARACTER (SRC) PARAMETER
 ____________________________________________


 SRC defines the character that TSSO will use  to  recognize  TSSO
 operator  commands.   For example, if this character is "#", TSSO
 will intercept and process all operator commands starting with  a
 "#".  The syntax is

   SRC=char
       ____

 where  char  is  the  character that TSSO will use.   The default
        ____
 character is a "#".



 TABLE PARAMETER
 _______________


 TABLE defines the name of the TSSO Automated Operations  Facility
 (AOF)  table.   The AOF table contains information used to inter-
 cept and responding to operating system messages.    (Information
 describing  how  to  create this table is specified later in this
 document.)  There is no default.  If this parameter is not speci-
 fied, the AOF is deactivated.  Note that this table  can  be  re-



 TSSO PARAMETERS                                                15









 loaded  (and  AOF  activated) at any time with the ".RELOAD" TSSO
 operator command described later.  The syntax is

   TABLE=table-name
         __________

 where table-name is the load module name that contains a TSSO AOF
       __________
 table.



 TIMEOUT PARAMETER
 _________________


 TIMEOUT defines the interval after which TSSO will log off an in-
 active console.  The syntax is

   TIMEOUT=nn
           __

 where nn is the maximum number of minutes of inactivity.
       __



 * (COMMENTS) PARAMETER
 ______________________


 The "*" parameter allows an installation to place comments in the
 TSSO initialization deck.  The line will be ignored by TSSO.  The
 syntax is

   * any-text
     ________

 where any-text is any descriptive comments the  installation  may
       ________
 want to include in the initialization deck.



 END PARAMETER
 _____________


 END marks the end of TSSO parameter input. The syntax is

   END

 with  no  operands.   If prompt mode was enabled, the MVS console
 operator will be prompted for additional  TSSO  parameters  after
 the END parameter is processed.




 TSSO PARAMETERS                                                16









 TSSO START COMMAND OPTIONS
 __________________________



 Start  procedures  under  release 4.3 have changed significantly.
 Depending on how you identified TSSO to MVS (see Step 7. on  page
 9),  JES  support  may  or  may not be available automatically at
 start time.  If not, you may initialize TSSO with  JES  by  using
 the  SUB= operand.  Note that, except for emergencies, YOU CAN NO
 LONGER START TSSO IF IT IS ALREADY UP.

 The TSSO start command has the following syntax:

   S TSSOÝ,PARM='Ý*¨Ýparm-member¨ÝPROMPT¨'¨Ý,SUB=JES2/JES3/MSTR¨
                     ___________

 PARM='*'          Allows  you to specify TSSO parameters(3) with-
                   out entering them previously into SYS1.PARMLIB.
                   This can be useful in emergency situations; for
                   example, if you need to enter a parameter on  a
                   one-time  basis,  or  if  you are locked out of
                   SYS1.PARMLIB and need to enter a different  pa-
                   rameter.

 PARM='parm-member'  Directs TSSO to use an alternate TSSO parame-
                   ter deck in SYS1.PARMLIB for parameters.    De-
                   fault is TSSOPARM.

 PARM='PROMPT'     Directs TSSO to prompt the MVS console operator
                   for  the name of a member in SYS1.PARMLIB to be
                   used for  parameters.    After  processing  the
                   named  member,  TSSO  will  also prompt the MVS
                   console  operator  for  additional  parameters,
                   even if the parameter deck specifies PROMPT=N.

 SUB=JES2/JES3     Initialize TSSO with JES2 or JES3(4).

                   NOTE: The  JES subsystem must be up for this to
                   work.

 SUB=MSTR          Initializes TSSO without the primary subsystem.
                   This should be used only if JES won't come up.



 ----------------

 3   Except the security-related parameters SECSYS, SECLEVEL,  and
     RACFID.


 TSSO START COMMAND OPTIONS                                     17









 If an emergency restart is necessary, the start command  has  the
 form

   S TSSO,PARM='/Ýoptions¨'
                  _______

 where  options are any of the PARM options listed above.  The "/"
        _______
 MUST be specified as the first operand.  When a force restart oc-
 curs, the inactive TSSO address space may  be  cancelled.    Note
 that  the  inactive  TSSO  does not relinquish its subsystem con-
 soles, and, therefore, it is not advisable to  force  start  TSSO
 unless absolutely necessary.
































 ----------------

 4   Although  TSSO has not been tested extensively using the JES3
     product, the interfaces should be the same because TSSO  uses
     standard subsystem interface calls.

 THE TSSO OPERATOR PRODUCTIVITY FACILITY
 _______________________________________



 OVERVIEW
 ________


 The  TSSO Operator Productivity Facility (OPF) is a powerful tool
 which, in conjunction with the Automated Operations Facility, can
 automate many procedures that currently must  be  done  manually.
 OPF extends the power of TSO to the MVS operator's console by al-
 lowing  TSO  commands  and CLISTS to be executed from an MVS con-
 sole, with the response going back to the invoking console.  This
 includes all TSO functions which use  standard  interfaces  (with
 the  exceptions  noted below) and control functions unique to the
 TSSO environment that alter TSSO options and display TSSO  infor-
 mation.

 OPF also allows TSO users to issue MVS commands and get responses
 returned  to  the  terminal or to CLIST variables.  TSO users are
 usually restricted to INFO console authority.    (See  "Authority
 Checking with OSCMD" on page 22.)



 TSO COMMANDS UNDER TSSO
 _______________________


 Most TSO commands may be run under control of the TSSO subsystem.
 The requirements for such commands are as follows:

 1.  The command must use standard TSO interfaces (namely, GETLINE
     and  PUTLINE) to perform I/O.  The command should not require
     input of any kind other than normal TSO command parameters.

 2.  THE COMMAND SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO USE FULL SCREEN PROCESSING.
     A command that issues  the  STFSMODE  FULLSCRN=YES  macro  in
     ACF/VTAM environments can hang the TSSO subsystem, forcing it
     to be cancelled.

 3.  The  command  should be TESTED UNDER BATCH TSO before running
                             ______________________
     it under TSSO, since TSO assumes that TSSO-initiated commands
     are running in BACKGROUND mode.
                    __________







 THE TSSO OPERATOR PRODUCTIVITY FACILITY                        19









 TSSO CONTROL COMMANDS
 _____________________


 TSSO supports a number of commands that are not directed  to  the
 TMP  for execution.  These commands are handled directly by TSSO,
 and are used to alter or query TSSO processing options.  See "Ap-
 pendix B. TSSO Control Commands" on page 67 for more information.



 TSO COMMANDS DISTRIBUTED WITH TSSO
 __________________________________


 A number of TSO commands that are designed to run with  the  TSSO
 subsystem  are distributed with the base code.  TSO commands used
 primarily from CLISTs include the "OS family" and the REPLY  com-
 mand.  These are designed to provide services such as communicat-
 ing  with  the  MVS  operator  and  issuing  messages  to the MVS
 console, communicating with the MVS command subsystem, and commu-
 nicating with programs that have issued WTORs.   Applications  of
 these  commands  are described below.  Figure 1 on page 21 summa-
 rizes the behavior of OSCMD with the CMDRESP variable in  differ-
 ent  environments.   Members EXJOBS, EXCKSPL,, EXSTVTAM and EXASK
 in data set TSSO.VERS43.ASM illustrate the OS family in some use-
 ful CLISTs.

 Other commands are provided as auxiliary TSO command  processors.
 These  include  the  CACHE  command  for  controlling 3880-21 and
 3880-23 cache devices, the LINKLIST command  for  displaying  the
 system  LNKLST  concatenation, and the VOLSER and VALLOC commands
 for displaying UCB information for DASD devices.  Also, the CPCMD
 command allows an MVS console operator running in a  virtual  ma-
 chine under VM/SP, VM/SP HPO or the VM/XA systems facility to is-
 sue CP commands and get the response back to the console invoking
 the command.

 A  complete description of TSO commands may be found in "Appendix
 A. TSSO Command Reference" on page 42.



 THE OSCMD COMMAND
 _________________


 OSCMD allows you to issue any MVS  command  (JES2,  VTAM,  etc.).
 OSCMD is most useful when issued from a CLIST, where the response
 is returned to CLIST variables.  The CLIST can be designed to ma-
 nipulate  these  variables  to  produce readable responses to the

 AUTHORITY CHECKING WITH OSCMD


 Because  OSCMD allows a TSO user to issue any MVS command, strict
 security must be enforced to prevent unauthorized users from  is-
 suing   dangerous   system   commands.      When  issued  from  a
 TSSO-initiated CLIST, OSCMD checks the authority of the  invoking
 console  and only permits commands of that level.  When issued by
 a TSO user, the OSCMDATH user exit checks  the  installation  au-
 thority  of  the  user's  ID.    By  default,  all TSO users have
 INFO-only authority as defined in the MVS system operations  man-
 ual.  Other authority levels (system, I/O, master) can be defined
 through  the  OSCMDATH user exit.  This exit allows the installa-
 tion to code a routine to determine the MVS command  group  level
 for  a TSO user.  Full authority can be granted on a per-user ba-

 THE OSWTO AND OSWTOH COMMANDS
 _____________________________


 OSWTO and OSWTOH allow you to write messages to the operator con-
 sole.  OSWTOH highlights the message.  The syntax of the commands
 is

   OSWTO message
         _______
   OSWTOH message
          _______

 where message is the text of the message issued.  Members EXJOBS,
       _______
 EXCKSPL, EXSTVTAM, and EXASK in TSSO.VER43.ASM  illustrate  these
 commands.



 THE OSASK COMMAND
 _________________


 OSASK  allows  you  to  ask the operator a question and get a re-
 sponse.  If it is issued from a TSO command  line,  the  response
 goes  to the user's terminal.  However, like OSCMD, OSASK is most
 useful when issued from a CLIST, where the response  is  returned
 to  CLIST  variables which can then be manipulated.  So that TSSO
 is not delayed too long for an operator reply, the  maximum  wait
 time   is  60  seconds,  after  which  the  default  response  is
 "NOREPLY".

 The syntax of OSASK is

   OSASK question
         ________

 Input and output variables are described  in  "Appendix  A.  TSSO
 Command  Reference"  on page 42.  Member EXASK in TSSO.VERS43.ASM
 illustrates OSASK with an interactive help procedure.



 THE OSPAUSE COMMAND
 ___________________


 OSPAUSE is used to delay CLIST execution for a  specified  number
 of  seconds.  This is useful if the CLIST any time the CLIST must
 wait for an event.  Member EXSTVTAM in TSSO.VERS43.ASM  shows  an
 example  of  a  CLIST that initiates a started task and must wait
 for it to initialize.




 THE TSSO OPERATOR PRODUCTIVITY FACILITY                        23









 THE OSWAIT COMMAND
 __________________


 OSWAIT directs TSSO to wait for a particular system message or  a
 timeout limit to occur before proceeding.  These messages are de-
 fined  in  the AOF table.  OSWAIT is intended to be issued from a
 CLIST.

 OSWAIT provides many automation opportunities that were (in  pre-
 vious  versions  of TSSO) too cumbersome to develop.  OSWAIT does
 not need to run from the TSSO address space.  In theory,  an  in-
 stallation  may  have  many  OSWAIT events outstanding at any one
 time in different TSO or batch address spaces.   For  example,  a
 simple job scheduler can be coded as a CLIST using the OSWAIT and
 OSCMD  facilities.   The CLIST can then be run under control of a
 batch TMP in a separate address space.

 The syntax of OSWAIT is

   OSWAIT ENTRY(entry-id) TIMEOUT(nnnnn)
                ________          _____

 where entry-id is the 1- to 8-character identifier of the AOF ta-
       ________
 ble entry; and nnnnn is the number of second to wait before time-
                _____
 out, maximum 86400 seconds.   For example, Figure 2  on  page  25
 shows  a  CLIST  that  will start a job, wait for the job to com-
 plete, and purge the job.

 See "Appendix A. TSSO Command Reference" on page 42 for more  in-
 formation on OSWAIT.



 USING THE WRITE STATEMENT IN TSSO CLISTS
 ________________________________________


 In  previous  releases of TSSO, operator commands and highlighted
 messages could only be issued using the WRITE statement with  the
 *COM and *HI keywords.  These facilities still work under release
 4.3,  and  CLISTs  written with them can be used unaltered.  How-
 ever, note that the difference between these facilities  and  the
 commands OSCMD, OSWTO, OSWTOH, and OSPAUSE is that TSSO processes
 *COM  and  *HI  directives AFTER the CLIST has completed, whereas
                            _____
 the TSSO commands will be executed IMMEDIATELY.  Care must there-
                                    ___________
 fore be taken in designing CLISTs with *COM and *HI, because  any
 TSO  commands  in  the CLIST are executed before any MVS commands
 are issued by TSSO.

 +---------------------------------------------------------------+

 The  *COM  and  *HI  facilities  are   available   only   through
 TSSO-initiated CLISTs.



 *COM KEYWORD
 ____________


 The *COM keyword used in the WRITE statements also enables you to
 issue  MVS commands.   When an output line in the SYSTSPRT output
 stream (the output from the TSO command or CLIST) begins with the
 keyword "*COM", TSSO will execute the remainder of that statement
 as an MVS operator command.  The syntax of  this  extended  WRITE
 statement is

   WRITE *COMnnn oscmd
             _________

 GUIDELINES AND SUGGESTIONS FOR WRITING CLISTS
 _____________________________________________


 1.  CLISTs  can  be used to write operator HELP procedures to the
     MVS console.  This is demonstrated in Figure 3 on page 28.

 2.  The REPLY command is useful in CLISTS to automate operational
     procedures with products that  communicate  to  the  operator
     through  the  WTOR interface (e.g., NCCF and IMS).  For exam-
     ple, if numerous NCCF commands are to be executed, these  can
     be executed in a TSSO CLIST using the REPLY command with mes-
     sage  ID DSI802A. See the description of the REPLY command in
     "Appendix A. TSSO Command Reference" on page 42.

 3.  Comments may be placed at the end of MVS commands because MVS
     treats them as MVS command comments.   However,  JES2  treats
     CLIST  comments  as data and tries to use them in forming the
     command.  Therefore, do not place CLIST comments on JES2 com-
     mands; place them on the lines following the  command.    For
     example,  the  following  CLIST  is  invalid because it would
     produce an invalid JES2 command.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

       PROC 0
       OSCMD $TEXIT6,ENABLE        /* ENABLE THE EXIT */
       EXIT

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

     This situation is remedied in MVS/SP JES2 Release  1.3.6  and
     MVS/XA JES2 Release 2.1.5.

 4.  Symbolic  substitution can be used in TSSO CLISTS as shown in
     Figure 4 on page 29.

 5.  Since operations personnel will be using OPF, the recommenda-
     tion is to allow them to write their own CLISTS.

 6.  TSSO CLISTS are invoked in the same fashion as TSSO commands.
     The normal TSO search sequence is followed.  The  recommenda-
     tion  is to allocate a SYS1.TSSOPROC data set and allocate it
     to DDNAME SYSPROC in the TSSO bringup deck. The SYSPROC  data
     set  may  also be dynamically allocated through the TSO ALLO-
     CATE command. Lastly, the TSO EXEC command may be used to ex-
     ecute TSSO CLISTS.

 TSSO AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY
 __________________________________



 INTRODUCTION
 ____________


 A high percentage of MVS commands are issued in response to  sys-
 tem  or subsystem messages, and these responses are predetermined
 by the contents of the messages.  The TSSO  Automated  Operations
 Facility  (AOF) frees the MVS console operator from routine tasks
 by automating responses to system messages.    AOF  is  a  table-
 driven  monitor  that  intercepts messages and carries out one of
 four actions:  suppresses, highlights, or lowlights the  message;
 or  issues  an  MVS, JES2 or subsystem command.  Because AOF does
 not require the services of the TSSO address space, any number of
 messages can be processed simultaneously.

 There are three steps required to install this facility; briefly:

 1.  Create the AOF table.

 2.  Assemble and link-edit the table into load module format.

 3.  Store the module in SYS1.TSSOLOAD.

 These steps are described in detail below.

 Note that the table can be updated at any time.   Also,  you  may
 create  multiple  tables,  although  only  one can be active at a
 time.  Multiple tables may be useful so that  different  sets  of
 commands  can be used at different times (e.g., first, second and
 third shifts).  You can change the active table in three ways:

 1.  By changing the TABLE= parameter in the parameter  deck;  the
     new table will be available the next time TSSO is brought up.

 2.  By  dynamically  reloading the table with the "#.RELOAD" com-
     mand; the new table will be available immediately.

 3.  By resetting the MATCHLIM parameter of any entry in  the  ac-
     tive  AOF  table  with  the  ALTAOF command; the new MATCHLIM
     value will be effective immediately.







 TSSO AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY                             30









 CREATING THE AOF TABLE
 ______________________


 There are three macros required to create the table:  TABSTART to
 start the table, TABENTRY to specify  actions  on  messages,  and
 TABEND to end the table.

 TABSTART  is  always  the  first  macro and can be specified only
 once.  It takes the form

   loadname TABSTART ID=table-id
   ________             ________

 where loadname is the name of this TSSO table and table-id is  an
       ________                                    ________
 eye-catching name to identify the table in a dump.  table-id will
                                                     ________
 also be displayed on the DISPAOF and .Q T commands.  The loadname
                                                          ________
 label is used as the CSECT name and must be used as the load mod-
                                     ____
 ule name.

 TABEND is always the last macro, signifying the end of the table.
 TABEND  must be present; otherwise, unpredictable things may hap-
 pen, none of them pleasant.

 TABENTRY  macros  are  entered  between  TABSTART   and   TABEND.
 TABENTRY  macros  generate  entries in the AOF table and take the
 form

   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=msg-id,ACTION=actionÝ,TEXT='operator-cmd'¨
   ________              ______        ______        ____________
                                             Ý,TEXT=(condition)¨
                                                     _________
                                             Ý,MATCHLIM=n¨
                                                        _
                                             Ý,ECHO=ÝYES/NO/LOG¨¨

 A sample AOF table, demonstrating most  of  the  capabilities  of
 TSSO/AOF  and  all  forms  of  the  TABENTRY  macro,  is  in  the
 TSSO.VERS43.ASM data set in member AOFIVP.



 TABENTRY OPERANDS
 _________________



 THE ENTRY-ID OPERAND
 ____________________


 Entry-id is a 1- to 8-character identifier  for  each  AOF  table
 ________
 entry.  The ID allows you to identify entries by name rather than
 position  in  the  table  to  the  commands  OSWAIT, DISPAOF, and
 ALTAOF.


 TSSO AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY                             31









 THE MSG OPERAND
 _______________


 MSG identifies an MVS, JES2, or subsystem message as  defined  in
 MVS/XA  SYSTEM  MESSAGES  (GC28-1376  and  -1377)  or its MVS/370
 ________________________
 equivalent.  msg-id is the first seven or eight characters of the
              ______
 console message.  msg-id may also be an asterisk (*), which  will
                   ______
 match on all console messages.  MSG=* is useful with the TEST op-
 erand described later.



 THE ACTION OPERAND
 __________________


 The  following actions may be taken in response to the identified
 message:

 1.  SUPPRESS (I.E., DO NOT PRINT) THE  MESSAGE  AT  THE  CONSOLE.
     _____________________________________________________________
     The macro takes the form

       entry-id TABENTRY MSG=msg-id,ACTION=SUPPRESS
       ________              ______

 2.  HIGHLIGHT  THE  MESSAGE  AT THE CONSOLE.   This is useful for
     ________________________________________
     highlighting important messages.  The macro takes the form

       entry-id TABENTRY MSG=msg-id,ACTION=HILIGHT
       ________              ______

 3.  LOWLIGHT THE MESSAGE AT THE CONSOLE.  This reverses  the  in-
     ____________________________________
     tensity  of  MVS messages that are automatically highlighted.

     macro as follows:

       entry-id TABENTRY MSG=msg-id,ACTION=actionTEST=(condition)
       ________              ______        ______      _________
                         ÝTEXT='operator-cmd'¨
                                ____________

     where condition tests portions of the message by substring or
           _________
     word.  Rules for coding the TEST operand are described later.

     NOTE:       TEXT can only be used if ACTION=OSCMD, OSCMDT, or
     REPLY.

 There is no limit on the number of TABENTRY macros  that  may  be
 specified  in  a given AOF table. Note that TSSO will process ALL
                                                               ___
 of the entries in the TSSO/AOF table for every WTO or  WTOR  mes-
 sage.   This implies that multiple ACTION= operands may be speci-
 fied for the same msg-id, by specifying multiple TABENTRY macros.
                   ______
 TSSO does not stop processing one ACTION= directive, but  contin-
 ues until the end of the table.



 THE TEXT OPERAND
 ________________


 The  OSCMD action allows you to specify an operator command to be
 performed in response to a particular message.   Optionally,  you
 may  select one or more portions of the message to include in the
 command.  entry-id This is useful for extracting a data set name,
           ________
 job name, or other variable information from a message and embed-
 ding it in the command  to  be  executed.    The  two  formatting
 options  in the TEXT parameter allow you to extract this informa-
 tion by substring or by word.

 To select information by substring, use the format

   \Snnn,yy\
     ______

 where nnn is the starting character position and yy is the number
       ___                                        __
 of characters to select.  For example, suppose you want to record
 the text of /*MESSAGE cards whenever they are encountered in  the
 job stream.  JES2 issues a $HASP104 message, and you want to cap-
 ture  characters  1  through  72 of the card.  Thus, the TABENTRY
 would look like this:




 TSSO AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY                             34









   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=$HASP104,ACTION=OSCMD,             X
   ________
            TEXT='#RECMSG MSG(''\S001,72\'')

 Note that nnn must be left-padded with zeroes.
           ___

 To select information by word, use the format

   \Wabcdnn\
     ______

 where a, b, c, and d define the word separator characters, and nn
       ________     _                                           __
 identifies the word's position.  A word can be a  maximum  of  16
 characters.  For example, given the message

   IEF176I WTR 1A4 WAITING FOR WORK ...

 you might want to purge the writer 1A4 with the command

   PURGE 1A4

 To  do this, you want to extract the third word from the message,
 which identifies the external writer name.   Thus,  the  TABENTRY
 macro would look like this:

   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=IEF176I,ACTION=OSCMD,TEXT='PURGE \W    03\'
   ________

 Note that if you do not need to define four separator characters,
 you must pad the field with blanks.  Also, nn must be left-padded
                                            __
 with a zero.

 Multiple "S" and "W" options can be used in one TEXT operand.  If
 AOF  detects an error in the TEXT parameter as a result of a S or
 W option, a message is issued and processing is terminated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
To insert the system ID of the issuing system in a SYSPLEX, use
the format:

   \Iabcdnn\
     ______

 where abcdnn are optional and ignored.  The trailing '\' must be
specified.

 For example, to route a command to the system that issued a
message, you need to insert the SYSTEM ID into the ROUTE command,
The TABENTRY macro would look like this:

   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=IEF176I,ACTION=OSCMD,
   ________
                  TEXT='RO \I001,01\P \W    03\'


 Multiple "I" "S" and "W" options can be used in one TEXT operand.
If AOF  detects an error in the TEXT parameter as a result of a S
or W option, a message is issued and processing is terminated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------


 THE TEST OPERAND
 ________________


 The TEST operand allows you to respond selectively to messages by
 "testing" the text.  For example, when payroll jobs complete, you
 may want to highlight the message, whereas  you  want  to  ignore
 other  job  completion messages.   The TEST operand allows you to
 match on message text by substring or word.

 To match by substring, use the format

   (S,nnn,yy,'literal-string')
      _______________________



 TSSO AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY                             35









 where you want to find the character string literal-string start-
                                             ______________
 ing in character position nnn for a length of yy characters.  For
                           ___                 __
 example, (S,32,07,'PAYROLL') would look for PAYROLL in  character
 positions 32 through 38.

 To match by word order, use the format

   (W,nn,yy,'literal-string','abcd')
      _____________________________

 where  you  want  to  find the character string literal-string as
                                                 ______________
 word number nn with a word length of yy characters; and a, b,  c,
             __                       __                 _________
 and  d  define  the  word  separator  characters.    For example,
      _
 (W,03,07,'PAYROLL',', ') would look for PAYROLL as the third word
 with seven characters separated by blanks or commas.

 Thus, the whole TABENTRY macro for our example could be either

   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=$HASP395,ACTION=HILITE,        X
   ________
            TEST=((S,32,07,'PAYROLL'))

 or

   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=$HASP395,ACTION=HILITE,        X
   ________
            TEST=((W,03,07,'PAYROLL',' ,'))

 It is possible to test on all WTO or WTOR messages by  specifying
 MSG=*.   For example, if you want to highlight all JES end-of-day
 messages, you would test for a first word of $HASP and  a  second
 word (i.e., job name) of ENDOFDAY.  The TABENTRY macro would look
 like this:

   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=*,ACTION=HILIGHT,             X
   ________
            TEST=((W,1,5,'$HASP',' '),(W,2,7,'ENDOFDAY'))

 MSG=*  is  also  useful  when  testing  for  message IDs that are
 greater than 8 characters or for message IDs  in  a  non-standard
 format (e.g., messages for MODEL 204 applications).



 NOTES ON THE TEST OPERAND


 1.    EACH  TEST  CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE TEST PARAMETER
     LIST, MUST BE ENCLOSED IN PARENTHESES.





 TSSO AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY                             36









 2.  There are multiple way to do the same test, as shown  in  the
     examples  above.  However, it is generally easier to match on
     words rather than substrings.

 3.  "Logical and" and "logical or" test conditions  can  be  con-
     structed with the TEST operand.

     a.  To  construct a "logical and", specify all the conditions
         to be met in one TEST operand:

           TEST=((condition1),(condition2),(condition3))
                  ____________________________________

     b.  To construct a "logical or",  specify  multiple  TABENTRY
         macros  with  the same MSG, ACTION, and TEXT operands but
         with different TEST operands:

           TABENTRY MSG=msg-id,ACTION=action,TEST=((condition1))
                        ______        ______

           TABENTRY MSG=msg-id,ACTION=action,TEST=((condition2))
                        ______        ______

           TABENTRY MSG=msg-id,ACTION=action,TEST=((condition3))
                        ______        ______

 4.  When using the TEST operand, TABENTRY  macros  can  be  quite
     lengthy.   To continue a macro on the next line, enter an "X"
     in column 72.   Since the TABENTRY  macro  follows  the  con-
     ventions  for  the IBM assembler language, the next line in a
     continuation must start in column 16. Note that blank charac-
     ters are not permitted, except if they are  inside  quotation
     marks.

 5.  The first word in the message is usually the message ID.  The
     first  column  position is the first character in the message
     ID.



 THE MATCHLIM OPERAND
 ____________________


 MATCHLIM specifies the  maximum  number  of  times  a  particular
 action can be executed.  When the MATCHLIM value is exceeded, the
 AOF  table entry is ignored.  Note that the MATCHLIM value may be
 reset with the ALTOF command.

 For example, if VTAM crashes, you may want TSSO to  issue  a  re-
 start  command  immediately but you also want to limit the number
 of restarts in the event VTAM has a serious problem that  is  not



 TSSO AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY                             37









 solved by a restart.  The following entry will restart VTAM up to
 three times after it goes inactive.

   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=1ST002I,ACTION=OSCMD,             X
   ________
            TEXT='START NETWORK',ECHO=YES,MATCHLIM=3



 THE ECHO OPERAND
 ________________


 Specifying  ECHO=YES  will  echo the command or reply of the TEXT
 operand to the console before the action is executed.  Specifying
 ECHO=LOG will echo the command or reply in the system log.   This
 provides  a  level  of  TSSO  accountability.    The  default  is
 ECHO=YES.



 ASSEMBLING AND LINK-EDITING THE TABLE
 _____________________________________


 Release 4.3 provides a sample  CLIST  for  assembling  and  link-
 editing the TSSO AOF table.  The CLIST makes the job of placing a
 new  AOF  table in production less cumbersome.  You will probably
 need to modify ASMTAB for your installation.  Its syntax is

   ASMTAB table-name ÝRELOAD¨
          __________

 The CLIST can assemble a moderately sized  table,  link-edit  the
 result,  and copy the resulting load module into SYS1.TSSOLOAD in
 about  10  seconds.    The  RELOAD  parameter  will   issue   the
 TSSO #.RELOAD command upon successful assembly and link-edit.

 Alternately,  you can submit a batch job similar to the sample in
 the TSSO.VERS43.ASM data set, member ASMTABLE.  You may tailor  a
 copy of this data set to your specifications as follows:

 1.  Include the appropriate installation-dependent information on
     the JOB card.

 2.  Change the SYSIN DD card to point to your AOF table.

 3.  Change  the load library name in the LKED.SYSLMOD step to one
     of your choice (e.g., TSSO.VERS43.LOAD).

 4.  Change the NAME statement in the linkage editor control cards
     to match the label on the TABSTART macro in your AOF table.


 TSSO AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY                             38









 Note that the Assembler parameters RENT and NOALIGN MUST be pres-
                                                     ____
 ent.

 A return code of 0 indicates that the assembly was successful.

 STORING THE MODULE
 __________________


 When the table assembly is successful, copy the load module  from
 TSSO.VERS43.LOAD   (or   the   appropriate  data  set)  into  the
 SYS1.TSSOLOAD data set.  To activate the new AOF table,  use  the
 procedures as described previously in this document.

 TSSO NETWORK COMMUNICATION CONTROL FACILITY INTERFACE
 _____________________________________________________



 The  Network Communication Control Facility (NCCF) is an IBM pro-
 gram  product  that  provides  network  control  in  ACF/VTAM  or
 ACF/TCAM  environments.  Through the addition of an OSCMD command
 processor, NCCF allows a network operator to issue MVS, JES2,  or
 subsystem  commands  and to retrieve responses at the NCCF termi-
 nal.  The NCCF version of OSCMD is a completely  separate  entity
 from  the  TSO  version.   The command installs directly into the
 NCCF load library, or a concatenated data set, and is defined  to
 NCCF in the DSICMD member of the NCCF parameter data set.



 NOTES ON THE NCCF INTERFACE
 ___________________________


 o   The  NCCF  and  TSO  versions of OSCMD share the same pool of
     subsystem consoles.  When defining the NUMCONS parameter (see
     "NUMCONS Parameter" on page 12) it is important  to  consider
     the number of simultaneous NCCF users that will be using TSSO
     facilities.

 o   Although OSCMD runs with APF authority, NCCF does not require
                                                  ________
     APF  authorization  with this facility.   TSSO grants APF au-
     thorization to the NCCF version of OSCMD  through  MVS  cross
     memory  services.  The operator command #.Q XMEM monitors the
     cross memory service environment.  A debug option displays  a
     message  when  the  NCCF version of OSCMD has called the TSSO
     cross memory services routine.

 o   TSSO assumes that all NCCF users are authorized to issue  MVS
     master  console commands.  The NCFOSATH user exit is provided
     for coding a routine to alter  the  default.    The  exit  is
     passed the NCCF user identifier.

 o   The  TSSO/NCCF  OSCMD  facility fully supports the NCCF ROUTE
     command.  This allows remote operators to route MVS, JES2, or
     subsystem commands to remote systems and to retrieve the  re-
     sponses.   This facility makes it possible for an operator to
     control (or at least monitor) many MVS hosts  from  one  NCCF
     console.






 TSSO NETWORK COMMUNICATION CONTROL FACILITY INTERFACE          40









 RECOVERY PROCEDURES
 ___________________



 TSSO  operates  as a proper subsystem under MVS. Because of this,
 it can run without support of a Job Entry Subsystem  or  communi-
 cations  subsystem.   Therefore, TSSO will initialize even if JES
 or VTAM will not.  Through the use of several command processors,
 TSSO provides facilities for repairing critical MVS files or load
 modules in the event a subsystem does not initialize.

 The EF command allows the MVS console  operator  to  perform  TSO
 edit  commands  on the file allocated to DDNAME "EDITFILE".  This
 DDNAME could have been pre-allocated through  the  ALLOCATE  com-
 mand.  The syntax of the EF command is

   EF (;cmd1;cmd2;cmd3...;cmdn)
        ______________________

 where cmd1 ...cmdn are TSO EDIT commands.
       ____________

 The PDS command(6) allows you to rename, delete or otherwise  ma-
 nipulate  members of a partitioned data set.  The PDS command of-
 fers a wide range of facilities and can be used to recover from a
 variety of subsystem problems.  You are encouraged  to  obtain  a
 copy  of  the PDS command (Version 7.3) from the Connecticut Bank
 and Trust (CBT) mods tape.

 Lastly, you can also use the standard TSO facilities, such as the
 ALLOCATE command, to correct JCL or other  initialization  errors
 in  major subsystems.   The full range of TSO commands are avail-
 able to assist in problem resolution.

      LEGEND         Provide a verbose Description of  the  format
                     of  the IDCAMS output.  (This is probably in-
                     appropriate for display at the console.)

 ISSUING OTHER IDCAMS COMMANDS WITH CACHE

      There are some commands that you may want to  issue  to  the
      cache  controller  through  IDCAMS that are not supported by
      this command.  For these occasions, an alternate form of the
      CACHE command is provided.

             CACHE * CMD('idcams-cmd')
                          __________

      where idcams-cmd is any command accepted by  IDCAMS.    This
            __________
      can  be a cache command, such as BINDDATA, or a command that
      has nothing to do with cache devices, such as LISTC.

      NOTE:  To issue these commands under a  TSO  session,  first
             execute the CLIST ALOCCACHE in TSSO.VERS43.ASM to al-
             locate the needed data sets.

 EXAMPLES
 ________

      EXAMPLE 1.  Turn  on  the cache device for the volume at UCB
                  263.

                    CACHE 263 ON

      EXAMPLE 2.  Turn off volume JESSPL to the cache device.

                    CACHE JESSPL OFF

      EXAMPLE 3.  Turn volume PGMPRO on to the cache device.

                    CACHE PGMPRO ON

      EXAMPLE 4.  Print status information for  the  cache  device
                  covering volume PGMPRO.

                    CACHE PGMPRO

 ____________________

 DESCRIPTION
 ___________

      The  CPCMD  command allows the MVS operator of a virtual ma-
      chine to issue CP commands on a VM/SP, VM/SP  HPO  or  VM/XA
      system.    Any  CP  command  of the appropriate CP privilege
      class is allowed.  The response of the command  is  returned
      to  the  invoking console.  Note that this command will also
      function under TSO and return the response to the CP command
      to the invoking TSO user.

 SYNTAX

              ______

 PARAMETERS
 __________

      cp-cmd    Any VM CP command.
      ______

 EXAMPLES
 ________

      EXAMPLE 1.  Issue the CP QUERY NAMES command and return  the
                  response to the invoking console.

                    CPCMD QUERY NAMES

      EXAMPLE 2.  Direct  VM  to  attach  the device at 3F0 to the
                  virtual machine configuration at virtual  device
                  3F0.

                    CPCMD ATTACH 3F0 * 3F0

                  Note that the device must also be varied on-line
                  by  the  MVS operator.   The MVS virtual machine
                  would need command privilege class "B" to  issue
                  this command.

 DESCRIPTION
 ___________

      The DISPAOF command displays the contents of TSSO/AOF tables
      which control the operation of the TSSO Automated Operations
      Facility.    The DISPAOF command can query either the active
      TSSO/AOF table or a table that has been assembled and is re-
      siding on DASD.  By default, DISPAOF will  display  all  en-
      tries  in  the  running  TSSO/AOF  table.    The information
      displayed includes the TSSO/AOF table  name,  ID  parameter,
      date  and time assembled, and TSSO version number.  For each
      message displayed, the table entry ID, MSG ID, ACTION direc-
      tive and ACTION TEXT will be  displayed.    TEST  conditions
      will  not  be  displayed unless the TEST parameter is speci-
      fied.  Optionally, the display can be  limited  to  selected
      message IDs.

      Information about alternate TSSO/AOF tables can be displayed
      by  using  the table-name parameter.   Alternate tables must
                     __________

 ____________________

 DESCRIPTION
 ___________

      OSCMD allows you to  issue  any  MVS  command  (JES2,  VTAM,
      etc.).    If  it  is issued from a TSO command line, the re-
      sponse is returned to the terminal.  If it is issued from  a
      CLIST, the response can optionally go to the CLIST variables
      (see  below).    Note  that,  when  OSCMD  is  issued from a
      TSSO-initiated CLIST, OSCMD checks the authority of the  in-
      voking  console  and  only  permits  commands of that level.
      When issued by a TSO user, OSCMD checks the installation au-
      thority of the user's ID.  By default, all  TSO  users  have
      INFO-only  authority; system or I/O authority can be granted
      on a per-user basis.   The installation can  control  access
      through the OSCMDATH user exit.

      be issued from a CLIST.

      If the message appears, OSWAIT gives  a  return  code  of  0
      (RC=0).    If OSWAIT was issued from a terminal, the message
      prints at the terminal.  Otherwise, the CLIST variables  are
      populated  (see  below).   If the message does not appear by
      the timeout limit, OSWAIT gives a return code of 8 (RC=8).

 NAME:  REPLY
 _____

 AVAILABLE UNDER TSO:  Yes
 ____________________

 DESCRIPTION
 ___________

      The  REPLY command is used to reply to MVS WTOR messages af-
      ter  the WTOR has appeared on the MVS console.(7) You do not
      need to know the MVS reply number to respond  to  the  WTOR.
      The REPLY command can, therefore, be used to automate opera-
      tional  procedures with products that communicate to the op-
      erator through the WTOR interface (e.g., NCCF, IMS, GDDM).

 SYNTAX
 ______

        REPLY MSG(msg-id) TEXT(reply-text)
                  ______       __________

 PARAMETERS
 __________

      MSG(msg-id)       The message you  are  replying  to  (e.g.,
                        DSI802A)

      TEXT(reply-text)  The  text of the reply you wish to give in
                        response to the WTOR.

 NOTES ON USING REPLY WITH IMS/VS
 ________________________________

      There are some installations that run multiple copies of the
      IMS/VS program product.   All of the  subsystems  issue  the
      same  message ID as a WTOR.  For these installations, an al-
      ternate form of the REPLY command is available to direct re-
      plies to the correct IMS subsystem:

             REPLY IMS(ims-id) TEXT(reply-text)
                       ______       __________

      where ims-id is the name of the IMS subsystem to  which  you
            ______
      wish  to  direct  the response, and reply-text is as defined
                                          __________
      above.  In this way IMS procedures can be automated.

 EXAMPLES
 ________

 ----------------

 7   Contrast this to  the  ACTION=REPLY  directive  in  TSSO/AOF,
     which  replies  to  messages  the instant they are generated.
     Thus, TSSO/AOF and the REPLY command  combine  to  give  full
     coverage on automating responses to MVS WTORs.

 APPENDIX B. TSSO CONTROL COMMANDS
 _________________________________



 TSSO control commands are used to direct TSSO  processing.    All
 such  commands  start  with the TSSO System Recognition Character
 (SRC).  The Examples below assume that "#" is the TSSO SRC.

 Note that TSSO control commands may be treated exactly  as  other
 TSO commands when used in a TSSO CLIST.  For example, a CLIST may
 process directives and then issue a .RELOAD command to reload the
 TSSO/AOF  table.    It is also possible for a CLIST to consist of
 nothing but TSSO commands. For example, a CLIST could be  written
 to query all the TSSO Parameters.



 GENERAL COMMANDS

 RESTRICTED COMMANDS
 ___________________


 The following commands are restricted to consoles with MVS system
 authority.

 #.ABEND               Abnormally  terminates  the  TSSO   address
                       space.  This  is a TSSO debugging aid which
                       should not be used in normal operation.

 #.J                   Requests a job identification  number  from
                       the primary subsystem.  This is required if
                       TSSO  will be using the primary subsystem's
                       services.  These services  include  submit-
                       ting jobs (with the TSO SUBMIT command) and
                       using  the  PRINTOFF command.  Note that if
                       TSSO was started using the  "SUB=JES2"  pa-
                       rameter, this command will have no effect.

 #.M                   Manipulates  the  TSSO  debugging facility.
                       This  command  should  not  be  used  under
                       normal circumstances.

 #.P                   Terminates  the  Time Sharing Subsystem Op-
                       tion.  TSSO can be restarted through the "S
                       TSSO" command as described on page 13.

 #.RELOAD TABLE-NAME   Loads a TSSO Automated Operations  Facility
                       table identified by table-name and performs
                                           __________
                       a  "#.Q  T" (see previous page).  If table-

                       name='NONE', then the AOF  is  deactivated.
                       ____
                       If an error occurs while processing the ta-
                       ble,  AOF  is deactivated.  The most common
                       errors include table-name not  being  found
                                      __________
                       and  table-name  not being a valid TSSO AOF

 APPENDIX D. TSSO/AOF TEXT PROCESSING ALGORITHM
 ______________________________________________



 This section describes the algorithm used in forming the MVS  op-
 erator commands issued as a result of processing the ACTION=OSCMD
 directive under the TSSO Automated Operations Facility.



 DEFINITION OF TERMS
 ___________________


      action-text  is  the parameter specified in the TEXT operand
                   of the TABENTRY macro.

      WTOTEXT      is the text of the  console  message  that  was
                   matched  by  the  MSG parameter. Therefore, the
                   first 8 bytes of WTOTEXT must have  matched  an
                   entry in the AOF table, as specified by the MSG
                   parameter.

      cmd-buffer   is  the buffer that will be passed to MVS to be
                   executed as an operator command.



 ALGORITHM
 _________


 1.  Examine the MATCHLIM value for an entry.  If MATCHLIM=999999,
     then ignore.  If MATCHLIM=0, then do not process  the  entry;
     otherwise, decrement MATCHLIM by 1.

 2.  Copy  characters from action-text to cmd-buffer until no more
                           ___________    __________
     characters are found, or a "\" is located. The "\" is a  sig-
     nificance  indicator that indicates to AOF that characters or
     words from WTOTEXT are to be copied.  When a significance in-
     dicator is detected, go to step 2. When  no  more  characters
     remain in action-text, pass the command to MVS for processing
               ___________
     and terminate.

 3.  The character after the significance indicator determines the
     type  of  formatting to be performed. Two characters are per-
     missible. The "S" directive  indicates  substring  formatting
     and the "W" directive indicates word formatting. If the char-
     acter  is  a "S", go to step 3; if the character is a "W", go
     to step 4.

 4.  To use substring formatting, the syntax, including the  lead-
     ing "\S" must be


 Appendix D. TSSO/AOF Text Processing Algorithm                 75






       \Snnn,yy\
         ______

     where  nnn  are  numeric characters that specify the starting
            ___
     position in WTOTEXT, and the yy indicates the number of char-
                                  __
     acters starting from position nnn to copy  into  the  command
                                   ___
     buffer.    Thus,  it  is  possible  to include all or part of
     WTOTEXT in the operator command to be issued.   For  example,
     if

       \S032,08\

     was coded, then character positions 32-39 of WTOTEXT would be
     copied  to cmd-buffer. The syntax for the substring parameter
                __________
     is very rigid.   Leading zeroes must be  specified,  and  the
     final  "\"  must be present.   Processing continues at step 1
     with the character following the final "\"

 5.  A word is defined as a string of characters separated by sep-
     arator characters. The maximum size of a word is 16 bytes. To
     use the word formatting option, code

       \Wabcdnn\
         ______

     where a, b, c and d specify separator characters to  be  used
           _______     _
     in  the definition of a word, and nn is a numeric value indi-
                                       __
     cating which word to use. The selected word is then copied to
     cmd-buffer.  For example, if
     __________

       \W=,   03\

     were coded, it would be interpreted as word  formatting  with
     the next four characters  "=", ",", " ", and " " used as word
     separator  characters.    In  this example, the third word is
     copied from WTOTEXT into cmd-buffer. The Syntax  of  the  "W"
                              __________
     directive  if  very strict. If you do not need four separator
     characters, you must code blanks (as in the example). The nu-
     meric specification must have two digits (including a leading
     zero if required) and the terminating "\" is required.  Proc-
     essing  continues at step 1, with the character following the
     last "\".  Note that a word is  at  most,  16  characters  in
     length, and is copied to cmd-buffer without leading or trail-
                              __________
     ing blanks.

 Note   that   the   formatting  options  are  available  only  if
 ACTION=OSCMD or ACTION=OSCMDT is specified.
