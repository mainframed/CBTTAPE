Be sure to specify this library as a 'SYSLIB' concatenation when you
assemble any members. All necessary macros should be in 'SYS1.MACLIB',
'SYS1.AMODGEN', appropriate product libraies (like ACF2, etc..), or in
this library. Some PROGRAMS called or refered to in this dataset
belong to program products (CA-1, CA-ACF2, etc..) so they are not
included here. You must be licensed for the product called or refered
to to use our code. If you are not, the code can be modified to remove
references to the unlicensed product or it can remain unusable.  If
you need help, find anything missing, or would just like to chat about
these programs please contact me at:

REMEMBER--> READ THE DISCLAIMER BELOW:

None of the programs, routines, and macros in this dataset are
guaranteed to work or be "safe". As with any PUBLIC DOMAIN software it
is the responsibility of the receiving installation to TEST the
software before running it on their production systems. It may crash
your system, and if it does, American President Systems assumes no
responsibility.  Install this software on your system AT YOUR OWN
RISK. Also, American President Systems does not guarantee to FIX any
of these programs or UPGRADE them when they become obsolete. American
President Systems may periodically put updated version of these and
other programs on the CBT tape, but they are under no obligation to do
so.  Many of these programs have run on our system, but that is NOT a
gurarantee they will run on YOUR system. Caveat Emptor.

Note also, that the same restrictions on responsibility for our
installation (American President Systems) hold true for Howard Dean.
I will, however, accept suggestions for improvements and answer
questions about these programs. A prompt reply, the correct answer, or
timely improvements are not guaranteed. If there are missing parts to
these programs, I will TRY to forward the macros or routines to Arnie
at CBT, however I do not guarantee to do this in a timely manner.
Also, just because these routines are on the CBT tape, I am not
available for "demand" support and neither is Arnie Casinghino. You
may call us, but we cannot guarantee a correct and prompt answer to
your problem. Again, you are on your own!  Caveat Emptor.
