*
*  THIS IS A TSO FULL-SCREEN EDITOR TO BE USED SOLELY FOR REMOTE AND
*    LOCAL 3270 UNITS. IT ALLOWES THE SIMULTANEOUS UPDATE AND BROWSE
*    OF UP TO 21 LINES OF A DATA SET, AND THE EXECUTION OF AN FSE/TSO
*    COMMAND AT THE SAME TIME.
*
*  THE FSE SYSTEM IS MADE UP OF 8 SEPARATE MODULES PLACED IN A
*    LINKLIST DATA SET AND A SUBROUTINE LINKED WITH MAIN MODULE
*    "FSE". THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THESE ROUTINES
*    AND THEIR FUNCTIONS:
*
*  1) FSE      THIS IS THE MAIN DRIVER ROUTINE TO WHICH CONTROL IS
*              PASSED FROM THE TSO TMP. IT SCANS THE PARAMETERS
*              BUFFER, SETS ALL PROCESSING OPTION FLAGS, BUILDS A
*              CORE (GETMAINED) SYSEDIT FILE ACCORDING TO SIZE OF
*              DATA SET BEING EDITED, ALLOCATES THE FILE, AND
*              PERFORMS THE MAIN BULK OF FSE SUBCOMMANDS FOR
*              PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS. ONCE THE FILE IS STORED
*              IN CORE, A MAIN LOOP IS EXECUTED FOR EACH TIME
*              THE ENTER KEY IS PRESSED: A STAE AND STAX ROUTINE
*              IS SET UP TO HANDLE ABENDS AND PA1 KEY INTERRUPTS,
*              THE FIRST 21 LINES OF THE DATA SET (STARTING AT THE
*              CURRENT RECORD) ARE WRITTEN TO THE SCREEN, A FULL
*              SCREEN TGET IS ISSUED TO READ THE CRT"S BUFFERS AND
*              ALL MODIFIED LINES ARE WRITTEN TO THE CORRESPONDING
*              RECORDS IN THE SYSEDIT BY LINE NUMBER. WHEN UP TO
*              A MAXIMUM OF 21 LINES ARE WRITTEN BACK TO STORAGE,
*              FSE WILL READ THE BUFFER WHERE COMMANDS ARE ENTERED.
*              IF IT IS A FSE SUBCOMMAND, A ROUTINE HANDLING THE
*              SUBCOMMAND IS EITHER LINKED OR BRANCHED. IF IT NOT
*              AN FSE DEFINED SUBCOMMAND, MODULE "FSETSO" IS LINKED
*              TO PROCESS THE COMMAND, WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT
*              WAS A NATIVE TSO COMMAND. UPON COMPLETION OF THE
*              COMMAND PROCESSING, THE LOOP IS RE-EXECUTED  ETC...
*          *   PFKEYS ARE ALSO PRE DEFINED TO PERFORM SUBCOMMANDS
*              AND ARE ALSO PROGRAMMABLE TO THE USERS" NEEDS.
*
* 2) FSESAVE   THIS MODULE IS LINKED FROM FSE TO SAVE THE SYSEDIT
*              FILE TO SYSDA STORAGE. ALL CHECKS REGARDING LRECL,
*              DSORG, RECFM ETC ARE PERFORMED TO AVOID ABENDS.
*              THIS MODULE IS ALSO USED TO CREATE A TEMPORARY
*              DATA SET (USERID.FSEABCDE) TO STORE JCL TEXT
*              AND PASS IT TO JES2 FOR BACKGROUND PROCESSING
*              BY USING A FAKE SUBMIT COMMAND INTERNALLY.
*
* 3) FSECHANG  THIS MODULE IS LINKED FROM FSE TO HANDLE "CHANGE"
*              SUBCOMMANDS. DUE TO SIZE AND RARETY IN USE IT IS
*              A SEPARATE MODULE IN THE LINKLIST.
*
* 4) FSEPRTY   THIS MODULE IS LINKED FROM FSE TO ALTER DISPATCHING
*              PRIORITY OF FSE-EXECUTING ADDRESS SPACE FOR BETTER
*              RESPONSE TIME AND TO DECREASE SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE
*              THREE INTERVALS IN TSO IPS"S. IT IS CALLED TWICE
*              ONCE ENTERING FSE AT PRTY=240 AND A SECOND TIME
*              LEAVING IT AT PRTY=126.
*
* 5) FSETSO    THIS MODULE IS LINKED FROM FSE TO PROCESS A COMMAND
*              NOT FOUND TO BE AN FSE SUBCOMMAND. IF AN S806 OCCURS
*              FROM THE LINK ISSUED IN FSETSO, MODULE FSESYSCD WILL
*              PLACE "COMMND NOT FOUND" MSG TO THE RESPONSE FIELD.
*
* 6) FSESYSCD  THIS MODULE IS LINKED FROM FSE WHENEVER AN ABEND
*              OCCURS. IT TRANSLATES THE HEX ABEND CODE IN THE
*              PASSED S.D.W.A. FIELD TO PRINTABLE EBCDIC AND MOVES
*              THE ABEND MSG TO THE RESPONSE FIELD.
*
* 7) FSEFREE   THIS MODULE IS LINKED FROM FSE AND FSESAVE TO FREE
*              ANY ALLOCATED FSE DDNAME.
*
* 8) FSEATTR   THIS MODULE IS LINKED FROM FSE UPON ENTRY AND RETURN
*              TO FREE A DCB ATTRIBUTE LIST ALLOCATED FOR NEW
*              DATA SET SAVE FUNCTIONS.
*
* 9) FSEPFKEY  THIS MODULE IS BRANCH-CALLED FROM MAIN MODULE "FSE"
*              TO EITHER EXECUTE A SPECIFIC SUBCOMMAND OR TSO
*              COMMAND ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESSING OF A PROGRAM
*              FUNCTION KEY, TO DISPLAY THE CURRENT ASSIGNMENT
*              OF PF KEYS 1 - 12, OR TO PROGRAM A USER"S FUNCTION
*              WITH A PFKEY.
*
* 10) IGC0024H THIS TYPE 3/4 USER SVC (248) IS ALSO USED IN A
*              MVT/SVS/TCAM ENVIRONMENT TO REPOSITION THE INTERNAL
*              TCAM MAJOR TERMINAL QCB TO TOP OF THE SCREEN IN
*              ORDER TO AVOID THE JUMPING TO THE NEXT LINE UPON
*              ISSUING A TGET. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT
*              SO AS NOT TO LOSE ANY OUTSIDE ISSUED MESSAGES
*              SUCH AS JOB-END NOTIFY, OPERATOR OR TSO USER
*              MESSAGES, WHICH WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE UNUSED
*              VERY FIRST LINE OF THE TERMINAL.
*              THE CODE IN "FSE" WILL ONLY ISSUE THE SVC IF
*              TSO IS RUNNING UNDER TCAM AND NOT UNDER MVS.
*              IT IS NOT USED UNDER MVS BECAUSE THERE IS AN
*              AWFUL AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD IN SCHEDULING AN SRB
*              TO THE TCAM ADDRESS SPACE (GETMAIN, FREEMAIN AND
*              OTHER SVC"S, WHICH WOULD EXECUTE EVERY TIME
*              THE ENTER KEY OR A PF KEY IS PRESSED. ALSO
*              IT WOULD BE JOB NAME DEPENDENT ON THE TCAM
*              PROC NAME IN SEARCHING FOR ITS ASCB IN CORE.
*
*
* FSE SUBCOMMANDS ARE :
*                     TOP,BOTTOM,PF,PB,HF,HB,UP,DOWN,RENUM,CHANGE,
*                     COPY,MOVE,DSN,SAVE,END,DONE,FIND,SAVEEND,
*                     DELETE,INSERT,COLUMN,SUBMIT,AUTOSAVE,PFK

*  IS AS FOLLOWS :  FIELD "SAVEDSN" WILL CONTAIN EITHER
*  THE FULLY QUALIFIED NAME STRIPPED OF QUOTES, OR
*  THE SPECIFIED DSNAME WITH THE TSO LOGON ID PREFIXED.
*  FIELD "DSNAME" WILL CONTAIN ONE OF TWO THINGS :
*  1) FOR A PDS(MEMBER), ONLY THE PDS NAME  2) FOR A
*  SEQUENTIAL FILE THE FULL NAME. ("DSNAME" IS USED TO
*
* THE SECOND PART OF THE ROUTINE WILL SCAN THE FIELD
*  "DSNAME" TO CHECK FOR A RIGTH APOSTROPHE (I.E. A
*  PARTITIONED DATA SET WITH MEMBER SPECIFIED).
* IF THE CHARACTER "(" IS FOUND, ONLY THE TRUE
*  DSNAME IS KEPT IN FIELD "DSNAME".
* A CHECK OF THE COMMAND BUFFER IS ALSO MADE TO
*  RETRIEVE KEYWORDS. (VALID ONES ARE NEW,OLD,CLIST
*  CNTL,COBOL,ASM,PLI,DATA). FLAG BITS FOR THE TYPES
*
*
*  ARE SET IN FIELD "DATATYPE". ONLY ONE BIT ON WILL
*  BE ALLOWED FOR THE DATA TYPE. BIT #1 IS EITHER ON
*  (NEW) OR OFF (OLD).
