+   This option allows a second set of PF keys to be defined.

+   Before this option is used, the number of PK keys must be correct.  (Use
    option 0.1 or 0.3.)

+   The active set of PF keys is that specified on the panel (A or B).  The
    other set is remembered but is not active.  When changing a set of keys,
    enter the new designation (A or B) first and press ENTER.  This will
    display the current values for the specified set of PF keys, and these
    values may then be changed.

+   The command%K2+will invoke this option from any panel.  If K2 is used, a
    parameter of%A+or%B+ may also be entered.  The parameter will activate the
    specified set of PF keys without displaying the PF key specification panel.

+   If 0.3 (or the%KEYS+command) is used, only the active keys will be known
    to that option.
