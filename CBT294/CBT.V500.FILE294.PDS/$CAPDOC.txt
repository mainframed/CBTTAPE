VSAM ANALYZER
-------------
  THE VSAM ANALYZER PROVIDES USERS  WITH A METHOD OF DETERMINING
HOW MUCH PHYSICAL SPACE A DATASET WILL REQUIRE.  IT CAN ALSO BE
USED TO DETERMINE AN OPTIMUM DATA CI-SIZE, CI AND CA FREESPACE
PERCENTAGES BASED ON FREE RECORD VALUES, TRACK UTILIZATION
PERCENTAGES, AND OTHER VSAM DATASET STATISTICS THAT ARE HELPFUL
WHEN DEFINING A NEW DATASET OR ANALYSING EXISTING DATASET
DEFINITIONS.
  IF YOU USE THE PLI OPTIMIZING COMPILER THEN YOU MUST CHANGE THE
ENTRY POINT FOR PLI FROM IHESAPB TO PLICALLA. HOWEVER, VSAMANAL
MAY RUN CONSIDERABLY SLOWER DUE TO TIME SPENT SEARCHING FOR PLI
MODULES AT EXEC TIME. (REFER TO PLI PROGRAMMER"S GUIDE FOR MORE
DETAILS.) IF YOU MUST USE THE OPTIMIZING COMPILER CHANGE THE LINK
EDIT STEP FOR VSAMANAL TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
   //LKED.SYSLMOD  DD  DSN=YOUR.LIB
   //PLILIB        DD  DSN=IBM.PLI.LIB
   //SYSIN         DD  *
    INCLUDE SYSMOD(VSAMANDX)
    INCLUDE PLILIB(IBMBPIIA)
    INCLUDE PLILIB(IBMBPGRA)

THIS WILL GIVE YOU BETTER RESPONSE TIME.

  THE DEVICE TYPES CURRENTLY SUPPORTED ARE 3390'S 3380'S 3350'S
  AND 3330'S.
  VSAM ANALYZER IS A TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR FOR 3270 DISPLAYS.  THE
ANALYZER USES 3270 FIELD AND PF KEYS PROCESSING AND CAN BE
EXECUTED BY ENTERING "VSAMANAL" OR AS AN SPF SUB-FUNCTION 9.1.

ENTERING INPUT PARAMETERS

  WHEN THE VSAM ANALYZER IS EXECUTED AN INPUT ENTRY SCREEN, WITH
REQUIRED AND OPTIONAL PARAMETERS WILL BE DISPLAYED
ON YOUR TUBE.  THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE INPUT
PARAMETERS.

"AVG-RECSIZE" - REQUIRED

AVERAGE RECORDIZE.  THIS VALUE CAN BE ANY NUMBER
FROM 1 TO 32761.  FOR FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS THIS
IS THE RECORD SIZE.  FOR VARIABLE-LENGTH RECORDS
THIS IS THE AVERAGE RECORDSIZE VALUE USED IN ALL
SPACE AND FREESPACE CALCULATIONS.  REMEMBER A
TRUE AVERAGE RECORDSIZE SHOULD BE BASED ON RECORD
SIZES AND OCCURANCES OF THOSE RECORD SIZES.  AN
INADEQUATE OR EXCESSIVE VALUE WILL CAUSE CORRESPONDING
SPACE AND FREESPACE VALUES TO BE CALCULATED.

"MAX-RECSIZE" - REQUIRED FOR VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS

MAXIMUM RECORD SIZE FOR VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS.  THIS
VALUE CAN BE ANY MEMBER FROM 1 TO 32761 BUT CANNOT BE
LOWER THAN "AVG-RECSIZE".  IT REPRESENTS THE LARGEST
RECORDSIZE YOUR DATASET WILL CONTAIN.

"RECORDS T/B LOADED" - REQUIRED

NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE LOADED  INTO YOUR DATASET.  THIS
VALUE CAN BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO 9999999 AND IS USED IN
THE CALCULATION OF NON FREE SPACE FOR YOUR DATASET.

"RECORDS T/B ADDED" - OPTIONAL

NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE ADDED TO YOUR DATASET BETWEEN
REORGANIZATION.  THIS VALUE CAN BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1
TO 9999999 AND IS USED TO CALCULATE FREESPACE FOR YOUR
DATASET.

FOR NON-KSDS DATASETS OR FOR KSDS DATASETS WITH NO CI
AND CA FREE RECORD PERCENTAGES SPECIFIED, THIS VALUE
WILL BE ADDED TO "RECORDS T/B LOADED" VALUE  TO
DETERMINE SPACE ALLOCATION.

FOR KSDS DATASETS WITH A CI AND/OR  CA FREE RECORD
PERCENTAGES SPECIFIED, THIS VALUE WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE
APPROPRIATE VSAM CI/CA FREESPACE PERCENTAGES THAT WILL
ACCOMODATE THE INDICATED NUMBER OF FREE RECORDS.

" % ADD RECS CA FREESPACE" - OPTIONAL

PERCENTAGE OF "RECORDS T/B ADDED" VALUE.  THIS VALUE
CAN BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO 100 AND REPRESENTS A NUMBER
OF RECORDS VALUE THAT WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE A
CORRSPONDING VSAM CA FREESPACE PERCPENTAGE.

THIS PERCENTAGE IS ANALAGOUS TO THE VSAM CA FREESPACE
PERCENTAGE, EXCEPT IT INDICATES A NUMBER OF FREE RECORDS
RATHER THAN A NUMBER OF FREE CONTROL INTERVALS.  THE
VSAM CA FREESPACE PERCENTAGE THAT IS CALCULATED IS BASED
ON THE EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF THE FREE RECORDS, THROUGHOUT
THE DATASET, IN FREE CONTROL INTERVALS WITHIN A CONTROL
AREA.

THIS VALUE AND THE CI PERCENTAGE VALUE CANNOT BE
COLLECTIVELY OVER 100.  IF THEY ARE UNDER 100, THE
DIFFERENCE (ALSO A PERCENTAGE) IS CONVERTED TO A FREE
RECORD VALUE, AND A CORRESPONDING SPACE ALLOCATION
WILL BE ADDED TO THE SPACE ALLOCATION NEEDED FOR "RECORDS
T/B LOADED" AND ANY CI/CA FREESPACE REQUIREMENTS.

" % ADD RECS CI FREESPACE" - OPTIONAL

PERCENTAGE OF "RECORDS T/B ADDED" VALUE.  THIS VALUE CAN
BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO 100 AND REPRESENTS A NUMBER OF
RECORDS VALUE THAT WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE A CORRESPONDING
VSAM CI FREESPACE PERCENTAGE.

THIS PERCENTAGE IS ANALAGOUS TO THE VSAM CI FREESPACE,
EXCEPT IT INDICATES A NUMBER OF FREE RCORDS RATHER THAN
A NUMBER OF FREE BYTES.  THE VSAM CI FREESPACE PERCENTAGE
THAT IS CALCULATED IS BASED ON THE EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF
THE FREE RECORDS, THROUGHOUT THE DATASET, IN THOSE CONTROL
INTERVALS NOT AFFECTED BY THE CA FREESPACE PERCENTAGE.

THIS VALUE AND THE CA PERPCENTAGE VALUE CANNOT BE
COLLECTIVELY OVER 100.  IF THEY ARE UNDER 100, THE
DIFFERENCE (ALSO A PERCENTAGE) IS CONVERTED TO A FREE
RECORD VALUE AND A CORRESPONDING SPACE ALLOCATION WHICH
WILL BE ADDED TO THE SPACE ALLOCATION NEEDED FOR "RECORDS
T/B LOADED" AND ANY CI/CA FREESPACE REQUIREMENTS.

"DEVICE TYPE" - REQUIRED

DASD DEVICE TYPE YOUR DATASET WILL BE ON.  CAN BE "3390"
OR "3380" OR "3350".

"KEYLENGTH" - REQUIRED FOR KSDS

LENGTH OF DATASET KEY.

"IMBED" - OPTIONAL

CAN BE "YES" OR "NO".
SEE "VSAM ACCESS METHED SERVICES".

"REPLICATE" - OPTIONAL

CAN BE "YES" OR "NO.
SEE "VSAM ACCESS METHOD SERVICES".

DATA CI-SIZE SELECTION AND DISPLAY

WHEN ALL INPUT PARAMETERES HAVE BEEN ENTERED CORRECTLY A DATA
CI-SIZE SELECTION SCREEN WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THE LOWER HALF
OF THE TUBE.  ALL AVAILABLE DATA CI-SIZES WILL BE DISPLAYED.
  THE SCREEN IS PAGEABLE BY USING PF KEYS 7 & 8 FOR BACKWORD
AND FORWARD DISPLAYS OF ALL DATA CI-SIZES.  USING THE DATA
CI-SIZE SELECTION CHART YOU CAN SELECT ONE OR MORE CI-SIZES
FROM THIS SCREEN.  WHEN THE DATA CI-SIZE(S) HAVE BEEN SELECTED
AND "ENTER" IS PRESSED, A DETAIL DISPLAY SCREEN FOR EACH CI-SIZE
SELECTED (STARTING WITH THE FIRST) WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THE
LOWER HALF OF YOUR TUBE.  USE PF KEYS 7 & 8 FOR BACKWARD AND
FORWARD DISPLAYS OF EACH DETAIL CI-SIZE SCREEN.

THE DETAIL DISPLAY SCREEN GIVES YOU STATISTICS ABOUT YOUR VSAM
DATASET BASED ON A DATA CI-SIZE SELECTED.  THE FOLLOWING LIST
IS AN EXPLANATION BY DISPLAY KEYWORD OF EACH STATISTIC DISPLAYED

CONTROL INTERVAL STATISTICS

CISIZE (DATA)

SIZE OF THE SELECTED DATA CI.

CI/CA

NUMBER OF CONTROL INTERVALS IN A CONTROL AREA.

RECS-MAX

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT CAN FIT IN A
CONTROL INTERVAL.  BASED ON "AVG-RECSIZE".

RECS-LOAD

NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT WILL BE LOADED INTO
A CONTROL INTERVAL OF A KSDS/AIX WITH THE
CI-CA FREESPACE INDICATED.  BASED ON "AVG-RECSIZE".

CISIZE (INDEX)

CONTROL INTERVAL SIZE CALCULATED FOR THE INDEX
COMPONENT OF A KSDS/AIX.

INDEX LEVELS

NUMBER OF INDEX LEVELS THE INDEX COMPONENT OF A
KSDS/AIX WILL CONTAIN.

CONTROL AREA STATISTICS

CASIZE (TRKS)

CONTROL AREA SIZE IN TRACKS USED FOR ALL CALCULATIONS.

RECS-MAX

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT CAN FIT IN A CONTROL
AREA.  BASED ON "AVG-RECSIZE".

REC-LOAD

NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT WILL BE LOADED INTO A CONTROL
AREA OF A KSDS/AIX WITH THE CI-CA FREESPACE SPECIFIED.

DATASET STATISTICS

TOTAL-RECS-DSET

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT THE DATASET CAN HOLD.  THIS
VALUE IS THE IDEAL NUMBER, BUT WILL MOST LIKELY BE TOO HIGH
FOR THOSE DATASETS
WITH FREESPACE BECAUSE OF CI/CA SPLITTING.  IT MAY ALSO
VARY FOR VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS IF THE "AVG-RECSIZE" IS
NOT A TRUE AVERAGE.

TOTAL-RECS-LOAD

NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT CAN BE LOADED INTO A KSDS/AIX
DATASET WITH FREESPACE SPECIFIED.

VOLUME-PHYSICAL STATISTICS

BLKSIZE (DATA)

PHYSICAL BLOCK SIZE OF THE DATA COMPONENT.

BLKS/TRK

NUMBER OF PHYSICAL BLOCKS PER TRACK.

TRK-UTIL %

PERCENTAGE OF TRACK UTILIZATION BASED ON PHYSICAL
BLOCK SIZE.


CYLNDERS
TRACKS

NUMBER OF CYLINDERS (IF CASIZE = 1 CYL) OR TRACKS
(IF CASIZE LESS THAN CYL) NEEDED FOR THE DATA
COMPONENT.

BLKSIZE (INDEX)

PHYSICAL BLOCKSIZE OF THE INDEX COMMPONENT.

TRACKS (INDEX)

NUMBER OF TRACKS NEEDED FOR THE INDEX COMPONENT.


FREESPACE STATISTICS

CA %

CONTROL AREA FREESPACE PERCENTAGE.  THIS VALUE
SHOULD BE USED IN THE DEFINE CLUSTER.

FREE CI'S/CA

NUMBER OF FREE CONTROL INTERVALS PER CONTROL AREA.

CI %

CONTROL INTERVAL FREESPACE PERCENTAGE.  THIS VALUE
SHOULD BE USED IN THE DEFINE CLUSTER.

FREERECS/CI

NUMBER OF FREE RECORDS IN A NON-FREE CONTROL INTERVAL.

FREERECS/CA

NUMBER OF FREE RECORDS IN A CONTROL AREA.

TOTAL-FREE-RECS-DSET

NUMBER OF FREE RECORDS IN THE DATA COMPONENT.  BASED
ON "AVG-RECSIZE".


***  WARNING ***

    ALL FREE RECORD VALUES ARE IDEAL NUMBERS AND IN MOST CASES
    WILL ALWAYS BE HIGH.  THIS IS DUE TO CI AND CA SPLITTING
    THAT CAN OCCUR WHILE INSERTING RECORDS. THEREFORE, IT IS
    RECOMMENDED THAT THE "RECORDS T/B ADDED" VALUE BE LARGE
    ENOUGH TO ACCOMODATE LOST SPACE THROUGH CI-CA SPLITTING.
