)F FUNCTION -
                 The VSAMANAL command is used to provide the user
                 with a method of determining how much physical
                 space a dataset will require.  It can also be used
                 to determine an optimum data CI-SIZE, CI and CA
                 freespace percentages based on free record values,
                 track utilization percentages, and other VSAM
                 dataset statistics, which are helpful when defining
                 a new dataset, or when analysing existing dataset
                 definitions.

                 The devices currently supported are 3390's and
                 3380's as well as 3350's and 3330's.

                 VSAMANAL is a TSO command processor for 3270 displays.
                 The analyzer uses 3270 field and PF keys processing
                 and can be executed by entering "VSAMANAL".

)O OPERANDS -

))AVG-RECSIZE -  REQUIRED
                 This value can be any number from 1 to 32761.  For
                 fixed length records this is the record size.  For
                 variable-length records this is the average record-
                 size value used in all space and freespace cal-
                 culations.  Remember a true average record size
                 should be based on record size and occurrences of
                 those record sizes.  An inadequate or excessive
                 value will cause corresponding space and free-
                 space values to be calculated.

))MAX-RECSIZE -  REQUIRED
                 Maximum record size for variable length records. This
                 value can be any number from 1 to 32761, but cannot be
                 lower than 'AVG-RECSIZE'.  It represents the largest
                 recordsize your dataset will contain.

))RECORDS T/B LOADED - REQUIRED
                 Number of records to be loaded into your dataset. This
                 value can be any number from 1 to 9999999 and is used
                 in the calculation of non free space for your dataset.

))RECORDS T/B ADDED - OPTIONAL
                 Number of records to be added to your dataset
                 between reorganizations.  This value can be any
                 number from 1 to 9999999 and is used to calculate
                 freespace for your dataset.

                 For NON-KSDS datasets or for KSDS datasets with no CI
                 and CA free record percentages specified, this value
                 will be added to "RECORDS T/B LOADED" value to
                 determine space allocation.

                 For KSDS datasets with a CI and/or CA free record
                 percentages specified, this value will be used to
                 calcuate appropriate VSAM CI/CA freespace percentages
                 that will accommodate the indicated number of free
                 records.

))% ADD RECS CA FREESPACE - OPTIONAL
                 Percentage of "RECORDS T/B ADDED" value.  This value
                 can be any number from 1 to 100 and represents a
                 number of records value that will be used to calculate
                 a corresponding VSAM CA freespace percentage.

                 This percentage is analagous to the VSAM CA
                 freespace percentage, except it indicates a number of
                 free records rather than a number of free control
                 intervals.  The VSAM CA freespace percentage that is
                 calculated is based on the even distribution of the
                 free records, throughout the dataset, in free
                 control intervals within a control area.

                 This value and the CI percentage value cannot be
                 collectively over 100.  If they are under 100, the
                 difference (also a percentage) is converted to a free
                 record value, and a corresponding space allocation
                 will be added to the space allocation needed for
                 "RECORDS T/B LOADED" and any CI/CA freespace
                 requirements.

))% ADD RECS CI FREESPACE - OPTIONAL
                 Percentage of "RECORDS T/B ADDED" value.  This value
                 can be any number from 1 to 100, and represents a
                 number of records value that will be used to calculate
                 a corresponding VSAM CI freespace percentage.

                 This percentage is analagous to the VSAM CI
                 freespace, except that it indicates a number of free
                 records, rather than a number of free bytes.  The VSAM
                 CI freespace percentage that is calculated, is based
                 on the even distribution of the free records,
                 throughout the dataset, in those control intervals
                 not affected by the CA freespace percentage.

                 This value and the CA percentage value cannot be
                 collectively over 100.  If they are under 100, the
                 difference (also a percentage) is converted to a
                 free record value, and a corresponding space
                 allocation which will be added to the space
                 allocation needed for "RECORDS T/B LOADED", and any
                 CI/CA freespace requirements.

))DEVICE TYPE -  REQUIRED
                 DASD device type your dataset will be on.  Can be
                 "3390" or "3380" or "3350" or "3330".

))KEYLENGTH -    REQUIRED FOR KSDS
                 Length of dataset key.

))IMBED -        OPTIONAL
                 Can be "YES" or "NO".  See "VSAM Access
                 Method Services".

))REPLICATE -    OPTIONAL
                 Can be "YES" or "NO".  See "VSAM Access
                 Method Services".

))DATA CI-SIZE SELECTION AND DISPLAY
                 When all input parameters have been entered correctly,
                 a data CI-SIZE selection screen will be displayed in
                 the lower half of the tube.  All available data CI-
                 SIZEs will be displayed.

                 The screen is pageable by using PF keys 7 & 8 for
                 backward and forward displays of all data CI-SIZEs.
                 Using the data CI-SIZE selection chart, you can select
                 one or more CI-SIZEs from this screen.  When the data
                 CI-SIZE(s) have been selected and "enter" is pressed,
                 a detail display screen for each CI-SIZE selected
                 (starting with the first), will be displayed in the
                 lower half of your tube.  Use PF keys 7 & 8 for
                 backward and forward displays of each detail CI-SIZE
                 screen.

                 The detail display screen gives you statistics about
                 your VSAM dataset based on a data CI-SIZE selected.
                 The following list is an explanation by display
                 keyword of each statistic displayed.

))CONTROL INTERVAL STATISTICS

                 CISIZE (DATA)
                 Size of the selected data CI.

                 CI/CA

                 RECS-MAX
                 Maximum number of records that can fit in a
                 control interval.  Based on "AVG-RECSIZE".

                 RECS-LOAD
                 Number of records that will be loaded into a control
                 interval of a KSDS/AIX with the CI-CA freespace

                 Maximum number of records that the dataset can hold.
                 This value is the ideal number, but will most likely
                 be too high for those datasets with free space,
                 because of ci/ca splitting.  It may also vary for
                 variable length records if the "AVG-RECSIZE" is not a
                 true average.

                 TOTAL-RECS-LOAD
                 Number of records that can be loaded inta a KSDS/AIX

                 Number of free records in the data component.  Based
                 on "AVG-RECSIZE".

))WARNING
                 ********** WARNING **********

                 All free record values are ideal numbers and in most
                 cases will always be high.  This is due to CI and
                 CA splitting that can occur while inserting records.
                 Therefore, it is recommended that the "RECORDS T/B
                 ADDED" value be large enough to accommodate lost
                 space through CI-CA splits.
