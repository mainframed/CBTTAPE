************************* SELECTION PANEL: *********************
   MAIN PANEL:  TECHSERV

   This is a selection menu... use a SELECT PANEL(TECHSERV) from your main
   panel or other menu panel under ISPF.

   ************************* CLISTS: *********************

I) ONLINE IDCAMS:
    The online idcams is a rudimentary first or second blush attempt with
    lots of "blue sky" for the interested party.  It works reliably, but
    has the look of several layers of prototyping - command backout has
    a problem.  See panel 'TECHSERV' for sample entry to main clist.
    This started out as a scrollable LISTCAT, but is useful for GDG
    indexs, recataloging tapes, VERIFY's, etc.

    1) CLISTS:
       IDCAMLMA - COMMAND MODELS
       IDCAMLMB
       IDCAMLMC
       IDCAMLMD
       IDCAMLMG
       IDCAMLMI
       IDCAMLMK
       IDCAMLML
       IDCAMLMN
       IDCAMLMP
       IDCAMLMR
       IDCAMLMV
       IDCAMLMX
       IDCAMLST - MAIN LOGIC
       IDCAMPRT - PRINT LAST OUTPUT

    2) PANELS:
       IDCAMP10 - PRINT
       IDCAML10 - MAIN PANEL
       IDCAMLSH - MAIN PANEL HELP (PF1)

    3) BAL PROGRAM:
       IDCAMSPF - ALTERS DDS, ALLOWS FOR SPLIT SCREEN FUNCTION.
       --  CLIST IDCAMLST ASSUMES THIS IS IN SYS1.LINKLIST, BUT IT MAY
           BE IN ANY LIBRARY - FIND THE CALL AND MODIFY.
       --  REQUIRES SYS1.MACLIB AND SYS1.AMODGEN IN ASSEMBLY

II)BATCH COMPILE FROM ISPF:

    This is a sample batch compile from ispf - two versions: one with a
    backup and one without - file must be cataloged and on disk!

    1) CLISTS:
       ISPCOMPC - MAIN LOGIC ==> CUSTOMIZE YOUR JOBCARD HERE!

    2) PANELS:
       ISPCOMP  - MAIN PANEL
       ISPCOMPH - HELP PANEL

    3) PROC:
       ISPCOMPP - PROC PULLS IN SYMBOLICS ETC - IN PROCLIB
                - USES "TMP.your.dsn" AS A BACKUP DATASET!
       ISPCOMPF - PROC FOR "FAST" COMPRESS.


III)FAST LOGOFF FROM ISPF:

    This can save many 'OGOFFS'.

    1) CLISTS:
       L        - ISSUES A LOGOFF.


IV)RECURSIVE ISPF MENUS:

    Using this single line CLIST, you can get another initial ISPF panel
    over and over again!!  Watch out, however, for 'recursion errors' and
    table errors when recursing anything but Edit, Browse and SDSF!
    Usually only one version of a 3.x utility is allowed per recursion
    string -- really useful for popping off to view SDSF in the middle
    of something else.  Each 'split' of your screen constitutes a 'recursion
    string.'

    1) CLISTS:
       MENU -- assumes your primary menu is 'ISP@MSTR'.
               Enter this by typing from any ISPF command line:
                    'TSO MENU'  or 'TSO %MENU'

V) EDIT MACROS:

    Just type JOBCARD from the Edit Command line: it appears at the top
    of the panel.

    1) CLISTS:
       JOBCARD - customize to your standards.         .
       DDDISK  - creates a disk DD statement after your cursor.
       DDTAPE  - creates a tape DD statement after your cursor.
