//***FILE 730 is from Hal Merritt, and contains a generalized       *   FILE 730
//*           version of a sample IBM program which allows you to   *   FILE 730
//*           run COBOL programs in batch under a z/OS.e LPAR.      *   FILE 730
//*           A description of the program follows:                 *   FILE 730
//*                                                                 *   FILE 730

//*      This routine or front end is the documented way to         *   FILE 730
//*       run most any COBOL program in batch under z/OS.e.         *   FILE 730
//*       There is no documented restriction as to version of       *   FILE 730
//*       complier, but the COBOL program must be linked with       *   FILE 730
//*       LE runtimes.                                              *   FILE 730
//*                                                                 *   FILE 730

//*      Language Environment for MVS & VM Programming Guide        *   FILE 730
//*      Release 5.                                                 *   FILE 730
//*                                                                 *   FILE 730
//*      There are two main modifications.  One, the return         *   FILE 730
//*      code from the called program is percolated instead         *   FILE 730
//*      of dropped.  Look for L R15,SUBRETC  near the label        *   FILE 730
//*      DONE.                                                      *   FILE 730
//*                                                                 *   FILE 730
//*      The second is to call a program named in the               *   FILE 730
//*      parm rather than from a hard coded entry. This             *   FILE 730
//*      code starts near label PARM2.                              *   FILE 730
//*                                                                 *   FILE 730
//*      What happens is the program name is extracted from         *   FILE 730
//*      the parm, then the parm pointers are adjusted so           *   FILE 730
//*      that the called program is unaware anything is             *   FILE 730
//*      unusual.  The program name is expected to be the           *   FILE 730
//*      first one to eight bytes delimited by a comma or           *   FILE 730
//*      blank.  The parm pointers are adjusted to the first        *   FILE 730
//*      position past the delimiter.                               *   FILE 730
//*                                                                 *   FILE 730
//*      Of course, the maximum parm length usable by the           *   FILE 730
//*      called program is reduced by the length of the             *   FILE 730
//*      module name plus one.  Other than that, the called         *   FILE 730
//*      program should not need any modifications.                 *   FILE 730
//*                                                                 *   FILE 730
//*      We call this routine PIPICALL, and stow it in a            *   FILE 730
//*      linklist library.  The JCL modifications are:              *   FILE 730
//*                                                                 *   FILE 730
