07 OCT 86  MODS FROM SAM GOLOB OF NEWSWEEK - LIVINGSTON N.J.        SBG
              ALLOW A DSID OF 0 TO BE A VALID DSID FOR A JOB.       SBG
           THE REASON FOR THIS MODIFICATION IS THAT RSCS VERSION    SBG
           2.1 GIVES DSID'S OF 0 FOR JOBS IT SENDS TO MVS FOR       SBG
           PRINTING.  MAKE -1, OR X'FFFF' THE INVALID DSID INSTEAD  SBG
           OF ZERO.  (THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE MARKED BY MY INITIALS SBG
           AND BY AN ISPF USERID OF "RSCS2.1").                     SBG
                                                                    SBG
   NOTE.  AFTER DISPLAYING A REAL DATASET, QUEUE WILL REMEMBER      SBG
            ITS JOB NUMBER AND DSID.  IF YOUR NEXT COMMAND AFTER    SBG
            DISPLAYING A REAL DATASET, DISPLAYS A NON-VALID         SBG
            DATASET (FOR INSTANCE--YOU DO A LIST, AND THEN A        SBG
            HELP COMMAND), A REPOSITION UP OR DOWN WILL GET YOU     SBG
            BACK TO YOUR FORMER REAL DATASET.  THIS IS SURPRISING   SBG
            BUT TRUE.                                               SBG
          IF YOU WANT TO NULLIFY THIS "MEMORY" OF THE LAST REAL     SBG
            DATASET YOU LOOKED AT, I HAVE INCLUDED A MEMBER         SBG
            CALLED NULLDSID.  JUST PUT ITS CODE AT THE BEGINNING    SBG
            OF ANY NON-REAL-DATASET COMMAND, AND THE "MEMORY"       SBG
            WILL VANISH FROM THAT COMMAND.                          SBG
