+  The%delete element+function is used to delete an element of a PANEXEC
   library.  (Use the%element list+option if you wish to delete several
   elements.) The mode of the element to be deleted must be either I
   (inactive) or D (disabled).

   To delete a single element, fill in the following fields of the library
   utility panel:
       - Enter%D+in the option field.
       - Enter the%library+information in the appropriate fields.
       - Enter the element name in the%element+field.

 Elements may NOT be deleted from the PANEXEC System Residence Library
 via the PANEXEC/ISPF dialog (this function may only be performed in
 batch mode).

 The following topics will be presented only if selected by number:
