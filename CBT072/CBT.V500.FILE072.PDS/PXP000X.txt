   PANEXEC/ISPF can produce two types of diagnostics: dialog error
   messages and PANEXEC messages for all PANEXEC/ISPF dialog functions.

   All PANEXEC/ISPF dialog error messages are displayed in the upper
   right corner of the panel in which the error occurred. A longer
   second level explanatory message is sometimes available and is
   displayed by entering the HELP command. These messages are
   automatically produced when the dialog can diagnose an error prior
   to invoking PANEXEC or in response to a PANEXEC function failing.

   The PANEXEC messages may be used for diagnostic purposes when a PANEXEC
   function fails. These messages are fully documented in the PANEXEC SYSTEM
   REFERNCE MANUAL (APPENDIX B).  To turn PANEXEC mesaages on or off simply
   specify Y or N in the DIAGNOSE field of the primary PANEXEC utility panel.
   The recommended setting for this field is N, since PANEXEC messages are
   usually not needed and producing them adds to the PANEXEC overhead
   processing.  This field may be changed in the middle of a PANEXEC/ISPF
   session on the primary PANEXEC menu or by issuing the
                      DIAGNOSE {ON|OFF}
   command from the element selection list panel. If neither ON nor OFF is
   specified, ON is assumed.
