+  The%confirm delete+panel is used to confirm that you really want to
   delete an element from a PANEXEC library following a delete element
   request.  If you want to delete the element, press the ENTER key.  If
   you made a mistake and do not want to delete the element, enter the
   END command.

   The following command, which may be entered on the element selection
   list panel, can be used to suppress or force the showing of the
   confirm delete panel following a delete element request:
          CONFIRM {ON|OFF}
   CONFIRM ON forces the showing of the confirm delete panel. CONFIRM
   OFF suppresses the showing of the confirm delete panel. If neither
   ON nor OFF is specified, ON is assummed.
