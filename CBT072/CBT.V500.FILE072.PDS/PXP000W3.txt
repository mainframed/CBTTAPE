%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD                                                             +

     Any TOP SECRET violation on PANEXEC elements will be indicated by a
TOP SECRET message:
  TSS932E xxx ACCESS NOT GRANTED TO DATASET $PANX.panelib.grpname.eltname

    where: xxx  = the level of access required for the PANEXEC function
           panelib = the PANEXEC library name
           grpname = the group name of the element
           eltname = the element name being accessed

     Currently, the only PANEXEC library is 'HRA.LOADLIB' and the only group
on that library that applications development staff can access is 'TEST'.

     Update access to an element will be required for any action that
adds, deletes or changes elements on the library (e.g. the A, C, CH, CL,
L, M, R etc. options).  Read access authority to an element will be
required for any other action which otherwise accesses the element but
does not modify it (F, P, etc. options).

For further information on PANEXEC security in the batch environment
(including any restrictions when using the compile/linkedit option or the
library maintenance option) see the HRA/DPA PANEXEC Standard and Procedure.
