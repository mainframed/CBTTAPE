      PANEXEC provides programmer facilities for maintaining object
and executable programs in a fashion similar to the way PANVALET
provides for source programs.
      In particular PANEXEC provides:

  - Control over executable programs
  - Library information (on load libraries) for audit and management
  - Library reorganization without halting processing
  - Ability to selectively restore from backup tapes
  - Programmer functions
    . add, change, copy, execute, compile, link, retrieve, print, etc.
  - Efficient utilization of DASD
    . utilities to identify and delete unused/temporary programs
    . minimize disk contention
    . DASD error protection
  - Security (native PANEXEC and external security through security
    interface exits) on programs and commands
