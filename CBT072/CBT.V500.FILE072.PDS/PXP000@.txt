   displayed by:
     - issuing the%END+command or
     - issuing the%RETURN+command

+  When you issue the END or the RETURN command on the PANEXEC primary
   option menu, when not in split screen mode, PANEXEC terminates
   immediately. In split screen mode, only the logical screen is
   terminated.

   The ISPF panel from which PANEXEC was invoked is then displayed.
