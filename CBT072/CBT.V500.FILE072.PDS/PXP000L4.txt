%TUTORIAL --- PANEXEC ADDITIONAL MACRO/COPY LIBRARIES FOR COMPILE/LKED ---------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
%
+  A maximum of 5 additional MACRO/COPY libraries may be specified.
   These libraries may either be PDSs or PANVALET libraries. If PANVALET
   libraries are specified, then the source program specified on the
   PANEXEC COMPILE/LINK-EDIT menu must be from a PANVALET library.

   There are no default libraries except for assembler (ASM) programs,
   in which case 'SYS1.MACLIB' and 'SYS1.AMODGEN' are automatically
   supplied as MACRO libraries. The concatenation order of the libraries
   is indicated by the numbers on the panel.

   Here is an example of specifying additional assembler MACRO libraries.
   These libraries will be concatenated to 'SYS1.MACLIB' and 'SYS1.AMODGEN'.
