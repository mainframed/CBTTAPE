   The compile/link-edit option (CL) generates JCL for a compile and/or
   link-edit, based on information you enter on the compile/link-edit
   panel, and then submits the job for batch execution.

   The CL options supports several source languages (ASSEMBLER H, VS
   COBOL, VS COBOL OPTIMIZER, PL/I F, VS FORTRAN) and the Linkage Editor.
   Compiler and link-edit options may be specified (for defaults see the
   following panels).  One may choose to do a compile only or a link-edit
   only.  The origin of the source program must be specified as either a
   member of a PANVALET library or a partitioned data set or from a
   sequential data set. If a PANVALET member name is specified, it will
   be used, otherwise the source will be obtained from the specified PDS
   (if a PDS member is specified) or sequential data set.  The output
   load module element must be specified on the primary PANEXEC library
   utility panel (except when compiling only).  Additional MACRO/COPY libraries
   and link-edit control statements and JCL may also be generated.

 The following topics are presented only if selected by number:
        1 - Compiler and link-edit options
        2 - Additional link-edit control statements and JCL
        3 - Additional MACRO/COPY libraries
