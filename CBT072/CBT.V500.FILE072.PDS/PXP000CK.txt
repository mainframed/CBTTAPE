+  Most line commands entered from an element selection list will cause
   another panel to be displayed to allow completion of the line command
   issued, with cursor positioned at the field(s) requiring completion.
   E.g., if the R (rename) line command is issued against an element,
   the primary PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY panel will be displayed with the
   cursor positioned at the NEW ELEMENT field to allow entry of a new
   element and/or group name.

   In addition, if an error is made on an element selection list another
   panel may be displayed with the cursor positioned on the field in
   error accompanied by an error message in the upper right corner of
   the panel. E.g., if the D (delete) line command is issued against an
   active element (MODE=A) then the primary PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY
   PANEL is displayed with the cursor positioned at the MODE field and
   the error message INVALID MODE VALUE in the upper right corner of the
   panel. The HELP command may be entered for a longer explanatory
   message (if one exists). The END command must be entered to continue
   processing any remaining line commands and then return to the element
   selection list.
