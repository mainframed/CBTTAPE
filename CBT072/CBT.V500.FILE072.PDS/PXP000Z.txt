+  The%clear panel fields+ function is used to clear the GROUP, ELEMENT,
   TYPE, STATUS and MODE fields on the primary PANEXEC utility panel and
   place an 'S' in the OPTION field. (The user must hit the ENTER key to
   invoke the 'S' option, if so desired).

   The 'X' option provides a convenient method of producing an element
   selection list on an entire PANEXEC library named in the DATASET NAME
   field without having to bring the cursor down and individually
   clearing unwanted fields.
