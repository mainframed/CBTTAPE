%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD                                                             +
   For example, over seven (7) minutes in wall-time were required to display
   the element selection list for a PANEXEC librarary containing 6400
   elements on an IBM 4381 processor using the Long option as compared to
   only two minutes required for the same display using the Short option.

   The following options and commands will also impact performance
   in creating or accessing an element selection display independent of
   the setting of the the DISPLAY VIEW field:
   1. Requesting an element selection list by generic element name -
      since the PANEXEC directory is processed in alphabetical order,
      choosing a generic name criteria which requests elements from the
      end of the directory will cause more of a delay than choosing
      elements from the beginning of the directory.
   2. For large PANEXEC libraries, delays will be perceived the first
      time one of the following commands are issued:
        L (locate), SAVE, SORT, scroll DOWN MAX
      Any subsequent use of the same or other command in the above list
      should NOT cause additional processing delays.
   3. Delays will be perceived for any large scroll down (several
      hundred lines) until the bottom of the directory is displayed or
      until any of the commands in (2) above are issued, after which no
      additional processing delays should occur.
