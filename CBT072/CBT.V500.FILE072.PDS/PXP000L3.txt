   The Linkage edit panel allows you to generate additional link-edit
   control statements and JCL to execute the PANEXEC compile/link-edit
   procedure.  Control statements may be obtained either from a data set
   (PDS or sequential) or may be specified directly on the panel as in-
   stream control statements. Additional link-edit JCL DD statements may
   also be specified directly on the panel.

   Here is an example of how to specify linkage editor control and JCL
   statements:

   INSTREAM LINK-EDIT CONTROL STATEMENTS:
   ===> INCLUDE DD1(PROG1)
   ===> INCLUDE DD2(PROG2)

   ADDITIONAL LINK-EDIT JCL DD STATEMENTS:
   ===> //DD1 DD  DSN=INCLUDE.LIB1,DISP=SHR
   ===> //DD2 DD  DSN=INCLUDE.LIB2,DISP=SHR

   NOTE: If you are specifying additional link-edit statements and you are
         replacing an executable element in a PANEXEC library, then you must
         specify "NAME eltname(R)" as the last link-edit control statement.
