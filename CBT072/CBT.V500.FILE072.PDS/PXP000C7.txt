   Use the%select+command (which must be entered as%S+) to browse an
   element from the element list.

   You can browse one element at a time, by entering a%S+command (shown
   below) or by entering the single character%"B"+in front of the
   element name (view the tutorials entitled%"element SELECTION LISTS -
   SINGLE element SELECTION".) Not every qualifier of the element name
   need be specified if the qualifier default value will cause selection
   of the correct element. The rules for specifying the element name are
   the same as for the L (locate) command.
