   Duplicate elements in the PANEXEC library (i.e., multiple disabled or
   inactive versions of the same element) are all displayed in the
   element selection list. However, when processing duplicate elements
   via line commands, only the last accessed duplicate element is
   accessible; all the other duplicate elements within that group are
   inaccessible.  This is true for all line commands except the 'D'
   (delete element) command. The 'D' command specified for any one
   duplicate element will delete ALL duplicate elements within the
   duplicate group from the PANEXEC library (although only one entry
   from the element selection list will be deleted.  The other duplicate
   directory entries will remain as inaccessible 'orphan' entries and
   will disappear the next time the element selection list is
   redisplayed).

   Duplicate elements are created in an element selection list via the
   'M' (modify mode) and the 'PM' (promote) line commands only.
