    To enable PANEXEC/ISPF to be invoked from an ISPF menu, option PX should
 be placed into an ISPF selection panel with the following line added to the
 processing section:

         PX,'PGM(PXP0000) NEWAPPL(PXP)'
 (for an example, see member ISP@PRIM in file 1).

    The macro library (file 3 on the distribution tape, courtesy of the
 National Systems Programmers Association (NaSPA) with some modifications
 and additions by the author) and source library (file 4) are not required
 for installing PANEXEC/ISPF but are supplied for users who may wish to
 customize PANEXEC/ISPF to their own installations requirements.  Member
 ASMHCL in the source library may be used assemble and link-edit the source
 modules. If a TOP SECRET security interface is desired, module $PANXSEC is
 supplied in source form and must be assembled and link-edited into
 STEPLIB/LINKLIB (and specified in the PANEXEC PANEOPT macro as a
 security exit invoking events $EXEC000, $ELEM000, $ELEM001 and $CMND000).
