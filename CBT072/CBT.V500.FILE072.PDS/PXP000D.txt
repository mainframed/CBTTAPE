%TUTORIAL ------PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY - FETCH ELEMENT---------------- TUTORIAL
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD                                                             +
+
+  The%fetch element+function is used to fetch an element of a PANEXEC
   library into a partitioned or sequential data set.  (Use the%element
   list+option if you wish to fetch several elements.)

+  To perform a fetch operation, fill in the following fields on the
   library utility panel and press the%ENTER+key:

     - Enter%F+in the option field.
     - Enter the%"from"+library information in the appropriate fields.
     - Enter an element name in the element field.

 NOTE:  If there are embedded INCLUDEs in the element to be fetched, those
 INCLUDEd elements must be found in the PANEXEC library for the fetch
 operation to be successful (whether or not the INCLUDEs are to be expanded
 or not). WARNING: CNTL elements containing linkage editor INCLUDE control
 statements CANNOT be fetched because PANEXEC (mis)interprets the INCLUDE
 DDNAME(PROGNAME) as a PANEXEC INCLUDE statement for element
 DDNAME.PROGNAME/OBJ which is probably not on the library.

 The following topics will be presented only if selected by number:
