     The second level of security restricts the deletion of active
elements from a PANEXEC library.  This is in addition to the
restrictions placed on accessing elements which are in production
status. Each PANEXEC command documents its own limitations as regards
production elements and will not be discussed here.

     The third and most extensive level of TOP SECRET security is
element level protection based on group name and element prefix.
Users will be required to request either read or update access to
elements on a PANEXEC library by specifying:
  - the PANEXEC library name
  - the group name of the element
  - the element prefix

     The typical PANEXEC security violation error message for restricted
restricted functions is:
  PS053 08-XX SECURITY VIOLATION - FUNCTION NOT ALLOWED.
