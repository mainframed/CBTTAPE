%TUTORIAL -------------PANEXEC LIBRARY INTEGRITY ---------------------- TUTORIAL
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD                                                             +

      The PANEXEC/ISPF dialog enforces library integrity by utilizing
      the IBM ENQ/DEQ facility to ensure that PANEXEC elements that are
      in use cannot be updated by another user (or the same user in
      split screen). For example, a user cannot rename an element if
      that element is currently being edited by another user.

      The MAJOR name (QNAME) used is SPFPANX.
      The MINOR name (RNAME) is the PANEXEC library name followed by the
      fully qualified element name.
                                                                        .
      To determine if an element of a PANEXEC library is in use issue
      the TSO/E command:

            DENQ SPFPANX/*

      which will display all the PANEXEC elements being enqueued upon.

      NOTE: To ensure the proper functioning of the ENQ/DEQ mechanism
      it is imperative that the element name be specified with all of
      its qualifiers (group, element, type, status amd mode).
