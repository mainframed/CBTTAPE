+  PANEXEC directory fields which may be manually changed are listed
   in the PANEXEC system reference manual on page 4-22. Among those of
   interest are:

   Normally PANVALET source information is carried forward automatically
   to the PANEXEC directory when a PANVALET program is compiled and link
   edited using the standard PANEXEC compile/linkedit procedures or
   when done through the PANEXEC/ISPF dialog utility using option CL.
   However, if the source program does not reside on PANVALET or a non-
   standard procedure is used in compiling/linkediting, PANVALET source
   information is not carried forward. In this case the change option
   may modify the following fields to track source information:
     SOURCENAME, SOURCECLSS, SOURCELVL, SOURCEDATE

   Other fields are useful for documentation purposes. They are:
     OWNER, ACCOUNT, DESCRIPTION and SYSTEM

   Finally, a word of caution: be extremely careful in modifying the
   ALIAS field. An element made into an alias via the change command
   incorrectly can cause the module to become un-executable.
