   To reach a specific element name in a list, use the scroll commands
   (%UP+or%DOWN+) or the%LOCATE+command.  You can select one or more
   elements for processing by entering any valid line command in front
   of the desired elements or you may browse the element by using the S
   (select) primary command.

   After you have finished using the element selection list, enter
   the%END+ command to return to the PANEXEC utility panel.  To display
   an updated element list, request an element selection list again.

  %Caution:+ Do not enter the END command until all your requests have been
   processed.  If unprocessed requests remain when you enter END, they will
   not be processed.
