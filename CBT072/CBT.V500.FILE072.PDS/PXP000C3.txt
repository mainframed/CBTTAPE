+  Scrolling in element selection lists is done the same way as for
   browse and edit.

    - To scroll down/up by the scroll amount, enter a%DOWN/UP+command.
    - To scroll to the right/left, enter a%RIGHT/LEFT+command.

   You may change the scroll amount field at the top of the display as
   in browse or edit.  Another method of scrolling is to use the L
   (locate) command, which is described in the tutorial,%"ELEMENT
   SELECTION LISTS - LOCATE COMMAND".+

   Scrolling (UP or DOWN) may be performed when issuing line commands.
   The scroll request is processed only after all line commands have
   been processed. (Any secondary help messages, however, will be lost
   after the scroll).  Line commands are reset when scrolling RIGHT or
   LEFT.
