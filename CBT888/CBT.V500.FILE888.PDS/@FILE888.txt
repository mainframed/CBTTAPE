//*           information which you can get via your Internet       *   FILE 888
//*           browser.  This package uses the z/OS system's HTTP    *   FILE 888
//*           server to put the information out on the Internet.    *   FILE 888
//*           It is really a first!  It is an excellent tool for    *   FILE 888

//*     For experienced and inexperienced host users, there is      *   FILE 888
//*     a demand to access different parts of the z/OS system       *   FILE 888
