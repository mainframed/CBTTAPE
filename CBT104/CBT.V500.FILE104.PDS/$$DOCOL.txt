17INTRODUCING JRP(JES2 REMOTE PRINTERS)                       PAGE 1

        THIS PRODUCT WAS DESIGNED AND WRITTEN WITH THE INTENT OF
    INCREASING USER AS WELL AS PROGRAMMER PRODUCTIVITY. IT("JRP")
    MAKES USE OF 3270 PRINTER DEVICES TO PRINT SPOOLED JES2 OUTPUT.
    OUTPUT DEVICES ARE DEFINED TO "JRP" VIA A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET.
    EACH CONTROL CARD IN THIS DATA SET DESCRIBES THE ATTRIBUTES
    OF ONE PRINTER.
       AFTER "JRP" INITIALIZATION,A SUBSYSTEM REQUEST IS ISSUED TO
    JES2 BASED ON EACH PRINTERS DESCRIPTION. IF JES2 CONFIRMS THAT
    OUTPUT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE PRINTER DESCRIBED,A SUBTASK IS CREATED,
    USING THE ATTRIBUTES DEFINED FOR THAT PARTICULAR DEVICE.
    THE SPOOL DATASET IS READ, BUFFERED, THEN WRITTEN TO THE PRINTER
    VIA "VTAM".

    ******* IMPORTANT NOTE *******
    JRP WILL PRINT A MAXIMUM OF 256 CHARACTERS PER RECORD
    ******* IMPORTANT NOTE *******

        "JRP" SUPPORTS VTAM SNA AND NONSNA TERMINALS AS "JRP"
    CONTROL TERMINALS. A MAXIMUM OF 25(TWENTY FIVE) TERMINALS ARE
    SUPPORT SIMULTANIOUSLY. ALL FUNCTIONS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT "JRPS"
    PRINTER DEVICES ARE AVAILIBLE FROM A "JRP" CONTROL TERMINAL.
    USE OF THESE CONTROL TERMINALS IS DESCRIBED BELOW ALTHOUGH
    PRINTER CONTROL COMMANDS ARE DESCRIBED IN SECTION "JRP COMMANDS"

     1. LOGON TO JRP CONTROL TERMINAL(USS TABLE LOGON IS PREFERABLE).
        OR  'LOGON APPLID(CJRPA)'
     2. ENTER USERID AND PASSWORD.(THIS IS ONLY MEANINGFULL TO "JRP"
        IF JRP123 SECURITY EXIT IS CODED ALTHOUGH AT LEAST ON CHARECTER
        IN USERID AND PASSWORD FIELD IS REQUIRED.)
     3. AFTER USERID AND PASSWORD ACCEPTANCE THE COMMAND SCREEN IS
        DISPLAYED. LUID IN UPPER LEFT COMMAND LINE ON LOWER LEFT.
        "JRP" CONTROL TERMINAL OR PRINTER COMMANDS MAY BE ENTERED NOW.
17JRP COMMANDS                                                PAGE 5

   THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ARE ARE ISSUED FROM A "JRP" CONTROL TERMINAL


   PRISCN            SET TERMINAL TO 3278 MOD2 SCREEN SIZE (DEFAULT).

   ALTSCN            SET TERMINAL TO ALTERNATE SCREEN SIZE AS DEFINED
                     IN BIND.
                     ** CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO ENSURE TERMINAL
                     WILL SUPPORT THE ALTERNATE SCREEN SIZE AS DEFINED.
                     INACT/ACT OF LU WILL BE REQUIRED IF INCOMPATIBLE
                     SIZE REQUESTED.

   WRAP               SET TERMINAL IN AUTO WRAP MODE.    (DEFAULT)

   NOWRAP            "JRP" WILL SEND ONE SCREEN OF REQUESTED INFORMTION,
                     'MORE DATA....' WILL APPEAR IN LOWER LEFT OF
                     TERMINAL THEN WAIT FOR FURTHER INTERVENTION FROM
                     "JRP" OPERATOR(ENTER). NO "JRP" COMMANDS WILL BE
                     ACCEPTED BEFORE THE 'MORE DATA....' CONDITION IS
                     CLEARED.

   NOUNSOL           NO "JRP" UNSOLICITED INFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO
                     THIS TERMINAL.           (DEFAULT)

   UNSOL             "JRP" WILL SEND ANY UNSOLICITED PRINTER STATUS
                     INFORMATION TO THIS TERMINAL.
                  **NOTE: UNSOL AND NOWRAP ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
                     ONE MUST BE REVERSED BEFORE THE OTHER IS ACCEPTED.

   LOGON AAAAAAAA     THIS COMMAND WILL ALLOW DIRECT LOGON FROM "JRP"
                     CONTROL TERMINAL TO AAAAAAAA(ANY VALID VTAM APPLID
                     AS SPECIFIED IN LABEL OF VTAM APPL DEFINATION).

   LOGOFF             TERMINATE THIS "JRP" CONTROL TERMINAL SESSION.

   CLOSE              REQUESTS THAT "JRP" CLOSE AFTER COMPLETING ALL
                     CURRENT PRINT ACTIVITY.(THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE AND
                     ALL CONTROL TERMINAL SUPPORT IS TERMINATED AT THIS
                     POINT). CLOSE AND ICLOSE COMMANDS ARE IRREVERSIBLE
                 *NOTE: IF JRP IS CANCELED BY MVS OPERATOR OUTPUT
                        CURRENTLY PRINTING OR RETRYING ON A "JRP"

   ICLOSE             REQUESTS THAT "JRP" REQUE CURRENT PRINT ACTIVITY
                     TO JES2,  TERMINATE ALL PRINTER SESSIONS AND
                     COMPLETE NORMAL CLOSE-DOWN. THIS IS THE RECOMMENDED
                     CLOSE PROCEDURE BECAUSE IT TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT
                     PERIOD OF TIME TO COMPLETE(NORMALLY UP TO 5 MINUTES
                     WITH 50 PRINTERS DEFINED). ALL "JRP" CONTROL
                     TERMINAL SESSIONS ARE TERMINATED AFTER CLOSE OR

17PRINTER STATUS                                              PAGE 8


      THE JRP '$DXXXX' OR THE '$DU' COMMAND WILL DISPLAY THE PRINTER
      STATUS TO THE OPERATOR CONSOLE.  THE MEANING OF EACH OF THESE
      IS AS FOLLOWS:

   ACTIVE       THE PRINTER IS CURRENTLY ACTIVE; THE JOBNAME AND
                JOBNUMBER WILL ALSO BE DISPLAYED.

   INACTIVE     THE PRINTER IS CURRENTLY IDLE AND IS AVAILABLE TO
                OTHER VTAM APPLICATIONS.

   DRAINED      THE PRINTER IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE WORK DUE TO
                A PREVIOUS JRP '$P' COMMAND.   THE JRP '$S' COMMAND
                WOULD RESTORE ELIGIBLITY.

   DRAINING     THE PRINTER WILL BE INELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE WORK AFTER
                THE CURRENT ACTIVITY HAS COMPLETED ON THE SPECIFIED
                DEVICE.THE JRP '$S' COMMAND WOULD RESTORE ELIGIBILITY.

   RETRYING     THIS PRINTER IS IN RETRY STATUS. ATTEMPTS AT CONTACTING
                THIS DEVICE HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL THUS FAR, THOUGH
                IT"S RETRY LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN REACHED.

   RETRYLM      THE 'RETRY LIMIT' HAS BEEN MET DUE TO I/O ERRORS ON
                THAT DEVICE, AND THE DEVICE IS NOW IN AN INELIGIBLE
                STATUS.ISSUE THE JRP '$S' COMMAND AFTER CORRECTING THE
                HARDWARE PROBLEM (POWER OFF, HOLD, CABLE CONNECTION,
                ETC.) TO RESTORE THE ELIGIBLE STATUS.

   ABENDTCCC    THIS PRINTER SUBTASK AT SOME POINT ENCOUNTERED
                A PROBLEM LEADING TO AN ABEND. THIS STATUS IS
                POSTED AS SUCH. JRP '$S' COMMAND MUST BE ISSUED FOR
                THIS PRINTER TO RESTORE OUTPUT ELIGIBILITY.

17JRP USE OF                                                  PAGE 9
   THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO UTILIZE JRP"S ABILITY TO INTERFACE
   WITH JES2. ONE IS TO SPECIFY OUTPUT CLASS AND SPECIAL FORM NUMBER,
   AND USE THOSE AS THE SPECIFICATION ON OUTPUT DD STATEMENT.
          BELOW IS THE SPECIFICATION FOR JRPDATA AND OUTPUT DD.

       EX JRP;PRT1      LU=VTS05A,SCS=N,LGMD=DSILGMOD,F=PRT1,C=A
       EX DD  ;//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=(A,,PRT1)

   ANOTHER USE, ALSO THE RECOMMENDED USE IS VIA JES NONSNA RJE ID"S.
   THIS TECHNIQUE LEAVES ROOM FOR THE GREATEST FLEXIBILITY AND
   EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION. BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF JRP INITIALIZATION
   CONTROL CARD AND USES OF RJE DESTINATION.

       EX JRP;  R001      LU=VTS05A,SCS=N,LGMD=DSILGMD,R=RMT001
       EX JCL; */ ROUTE RMT001  (ROUTES ALL JOB OUTPUT TO RMT001)
       EX DD ; //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*,DEST=RMT001
       EX TSO;  ALLOC SYSOUT(A) DEST(RMT001) DD(SYSPRINT)

   THE RJE ID"S YOU WISH TO USE MUST BE DEFINED TO JES2. IF YOU HAVE
   NO RJE ID"S DEFINED OR WISH TO DEFINE MORE A JES2 COLD START IS
   REQUIRED.

   IT IS RECOMMENDED, ONLY TO AVOID CONFUSION, THAT THE PRINTER NAME
   BE CHOSEN BASED ON IT"S REMOTE ID(OR FORM NUMBER IF THAT IS THE
   METHOD OF USE). FOR EXAMPLE IF THE FORM NUMBER IS PRT1 THEN THE

                    CALLS JRP210 WHICH PRESENTS THE REQUEST FOR OUTPUT
                    TO JES2. IF JES2 PASSES CONFIRMATION THAT THE
                    OUTPUT CRITERIA SPECIFIED IN THE JRP PRINTER CONTOL
                    BLOCK HAS BEEN MET THEN JRP220(DYNAMIC ALLOCATE/
                    DEALLOCATE) IS CALLED. UPON SUCCESSFUL RETURN FROM
                    JRP220 A SUBTASK IS CREATED AS JRP300(PRINTER I/O).

 7 JRP210           JES2 PROCESSED SYSOUT SECONDARY INTERFACE

                    THIS MODULE PRESENTS THE SSOB CREATED BY JRP200
                    TO JES2 AND PASSES A RETURN CODE BASED ON THE
                    RESULTS OF THAT PRESENTATION BACK TO JRP200.

 7 JRP220           DYNAMIC ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE MODULE

                    THIS MODULE DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATES OR DEALLOCATES
                    BASED ON A REQUEST FROM JRP200 A SPOOL DATA-SET
                    AND SETS THE DATA-SET DISPOSITION AS DIRECTED
                    BY THE JRP PRINTER CONTROL BLOCK.

17 JRP300           PRINTER I/O MODULE                    PAGE 17

                    THIS MODULE BUILDS AND INITIALIZES THE PRINTERS
                    VTAM CONTROL BLOCKS. OPENS THE SPOOL DATA-SET
                    PREVIOUSLY CONFIRMED BY JRP200 AND ALLOCATED BY
                    JRP220. BEGINS A SESSION WITH THE DESIGNATED
                    PRINTER, CALLS JRP310 TO NOTIFY JRP CONTROL TERMINAL
                    OPERATOR(WHO HAS REQUESTED UNSOLICITED OUTPUT) THAT
                    OUTPUT IS ABOUT TO BEGIN ON THIS PRINTER, QSAM READS
                    THE SPOOL DATA-SET UNTIL THE PRINTER BUFFER IS FULL,
                    THE SENDS THE DATA TO THE PRINTER VIA 3270 VTAM
                    PROTOCOL. UPON NEGATIVE RESPONSE FROM VTAM THE
                    PRINTER STATUS CONTROL BLOCK FIELDS ARE SET AS
