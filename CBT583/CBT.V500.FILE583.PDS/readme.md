//***FILE 583 is from Jim Moore, and contains a program called      *   FILE 583
//*           PROFSET, which is an initial Edit Macro, written      *   FILE 583
//*           in COBOL, that sets up your ISPF EDIT profile for     *   FILE 583
//*           your ISPF session.                                    *   FILE 583
//*                                                                 *   FILE 583
//*           This program was written to illustrate principles     *   FILE 583
//*           of initial Edit Macros, and ISPF EDIT profiles,       *   FILE 583
//*           which is the basis for a series of articles in        *   FILE 583
//*           "Technical Support" magazine.                         *   FILE 583
//*                                                                 *   FILE 583
//*           There is a second program package in this file, that  *   FILE 583
//*           is called EPROF.  With this package, you can set      *   FILE 583
//*           edit profile values globally, and do a lot of nice    *   FILE 583
//*           things with edit profiles, as follows:                *   FILE 583
//*                                                                 *   FILE 583
//*           This utility allows for edit profile tables to be     *   FILE 583
//*           manipulated.  That is, settings can be changed        *   FILE 583
//*           (STATS, RECOVERY, NULLS, etc), individual rows        *   FILE 583
//*           (profiles) can be deleted and settings can be         *   FILE 583
//*           globally propagated into ALL profiles---kind of       *   FILE 583
//*           like STATS ON ALL.                                    *   FILE 583
//*                                                                 *   FILE 583
