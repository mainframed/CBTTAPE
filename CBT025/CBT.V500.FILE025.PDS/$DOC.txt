           09/25/98 - WORKS WITH OS390 2.4 AND SYSPLEX.  FIXED AN OLD
           PROBLEM WITH CONSOLES THAT DID NOT SUPPORT EXTENDED
           DATASTREAM.

CONS390  -  CONSOLE PROGRAM.  DISPLAYS CONSOLES AS A
TSO COMMAND UNDER ISPF OR TSO.  FEATURES:

        HIGHLIGHTED MESSAGES ON CONSOLE ARE HIGHLIGHTED
        AUTOMATIC UPDATE FEATURE
        ENTER OPERATOR COMMANDS
        DISPLAY LAST IPL AND IF CLPA WAS DONE  (PF12)

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. UPDATE THE ASSEMBLY JCL CALLED CONS390J TO REFLECT LIBRARIES AT
YOUR INSTALLATION.
2. ENTER 'TSO CONSOLE' FROM ISPF OR CONSOLE FROM THE READY STATE IN TSO.
3. PF-1 WILL DISPLAY PFKEY DEFINITIONS.
4. THE AUTOMATIC UPDATE AT LESS THAN 2 SECONDS IS HARD TO STOP ON
3290'S. USE AUTOMATIC UPDATES OF 4 SECONDS OR MORE FOR THESE.
5. DOES A TGET ON MOD2/5'S TO ALLOW FOR MOD 5'S THAT DID NOT DISPLAY
CORRECTLY UNDER THE OLD ONE.
6. FOR A SYSPLEX ENVIRONMENT, IT CHECKS TO SEE IF THE CONSOLE IS ACTIVE
ON THAT SYSTEM.  IF NO CONSOLE IS ACTIVE ON THAT SYSTEM IT WILL ABEND.
