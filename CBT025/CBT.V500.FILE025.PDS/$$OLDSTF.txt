I've saved everything that used to be in this file, in several members.

If any materials appear to be missing, look in member RESTESA, which
   was saved from the last version of this file.

The original version of this file is in member OLDVERS.


The ESA version 4 version of this file is in two members:

                OLDESAVR
                RESTESA         which should be combined into one pds.

      These members are in PDSLOAD (IEBUPDTE with ISPF stats
      preserved) format.  If you use PDSLOAD (File 035 - source
      File 093) to reconstitute PDS'es from these members, then
      you'll get ISPF statistics.  If you use IEBUPDTE, you won't.
      A model PDSLOAD job is included here (member $PDSLOAD)--for OLD.
      A model PDSLOAD job is included here (member $PDSLOAE)--for ESA.

The current version (OS/390 version 2.4), is in this pds, with
separate members.


I've done the packaging of the old versions of this file.
