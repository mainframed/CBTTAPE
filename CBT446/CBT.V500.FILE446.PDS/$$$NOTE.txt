I don't know how much interest this would have, but I have gone
insane and written a COBOL program. This program is a small example
(341 lines of code) of how to use COBOL to write an OS/390 UNIX
System Services program. The program uses the BPX1WRT subroutine to
write to STDOUT. It uses this interface to write the UNIX parameters
(like C's argc and argv). It also uses that interface to write out
the currently set environment variables.  For example:

./UNIX0002 arg1 arg2 arg3

would result in output such as:

NUMBER OF ARGUMENT IS: 4
ARGCÝ 000¨=./UNIX0002
ARGCÝ 001¨=arg1
ARGCÝ 002¨=arg2
ARGCÝ 003¨=arg3

NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IS: 3
ENVÝ 000¨=VAR1=VALUE1
ENVÝ 001¨=VAR2=VALUE2
ENVÝ 002¨=VAR3=VALUE3

This is a single, COBOL source program.
