//***FILE 949 is an IEHMOVE substitute program called PDSUR, which  *   FILE 949
//*           is more flexible than IEHMOVE, and is much easier to  *   FILE 949
//*           use.  Written in 1973 by Gene Czarcinski, it was      *   FILE 949
//*           recently updated for z/OS disks by a qualified        *   FILE 949
//*           updater.                                              *   FILE 949

//*           I am surprised that this program never made it to     *   FILE 949

//*           Corrections were made by Peter Glanzmann, mostly      *   FILE 949

//*           A good use for this program is to restore IEHMOVE-    *   FILE 949
//*           unloaded pds'es from old tapes.  But it is good       *   FILE 949
//*           for unloading a pds into IEHMOVE-format quickly,      *   FILE 949
//*           and it can be used as an alternative to XMIT          *   FILE 949
//*           sequentializing of pds'es.  With this program,        *   FILE 949
//*           sequential blocksizes can be any multiple of 80,      *   FILE 949
//*           and they are not restricted to 800 as with IEHMOVE.   *   FILE 949
