//*    ISPFINI -- ISPF Start Up REXX EXEC (Multiple Screens)        *   FILE 750
//*               NOTE:  For this REXX EXEC to work properly        *   FILE 750
//*               (seamlessly) you should change your ISPF          *   FILE 750
//*               SWAP key to SWAP NEXT. You should set it up       *   FILE 750
//*               that way for any time you are using more          *   FILE 750
//*               than two screens inside ISPF                      *   FILE 750

//*                NOTE:  Contrary to what my article said,         *   FILE 750
//*                you can only logon once on any single z/OS       *   FILE 750
//*                image with the same USERID.  Also, the           *   FILE 750
