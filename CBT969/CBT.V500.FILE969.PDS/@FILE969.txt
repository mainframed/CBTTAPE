//*     The PDSEGEN ISPF Dialog found in this package will          *   FILE 969
//*     present the user with a list of all members of their        *   FILE 969

//*     including Browse, Edit, View, Compare, Delete, Promote,     *   FILE 969
//*     and Recover.  The list of members will be updated           *   FILE 969
//*     appropriately as members are edited, added, deleted,        *   FILE 969
//*     recovered, or promoted. Full member filtering using         *   FILE 969

//*     it can be transported/copied by other utilities. Then       *   FILE 969
//*     there is the Restore capability to rebuild the PDSE with    *   FILE 969

//*     The Copy command will copy a PDS into a PDSE with           *   FILE 969
//*     generations enabled or copy a PDSE with members and         *   FILE 969

//*     The PRUNE function will let you remove older (or all)       *   FILE 969
//*     generations that the user considers obsolete. Or            *   FILE 969
//*     completely empty the PDSE of all members and generations.   *   FILE 969
