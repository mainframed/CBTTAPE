Version 1.0.0 Posted to files area.
1) First attempt at CUT mode support, only worked with TN3270
Plus emulator.


Version 1.0.1 Never posted to files area.
Beta test release.  Sent to specific users only.


Version 1.0.2 Posted to files area.
1) Corrected data stream to be in same format as used by IBM's
IND$FILE program.

2) Externalized the code page translation table.  As delivered,
ind$file uses code page 1047 to ISO-Latin-1 which may or not be
what you want.  Early releases of MVS used code page 037 but more
modern releases rely on code page 1047.  The source for the code
page is supplied should you wish to construct your own code page
table.

3) Added support for displaying data streams.  If you have
problems with this version, please allocate ddname stderr to
sysout, run ind$file, deallocate ddname stderr and send me the
output.


Version 1.0.3
1) Made default code page member "CODEPAGE", if this fails to
load then code page member "CDPG1047" is loaded, if this fails
then an error message is displayed and the program terminates
with RC=12.

2) Added code page member CDPG037.

3) Changed default allocation for new files from
CYL SPACE(1,1) to TRACKS SPACE(60,600) RELEASE.

Version 1.0.4
1) Corrected GET logic to send special EOF sequence before
sending TRANS03 Transfer complete message. (Thanks to Jim
Morrison).

Version 1.0.5
1) Corrected bug in upper case translation routine. (Thanks to
Jim Morrison)
