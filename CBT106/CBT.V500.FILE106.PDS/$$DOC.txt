PLEASE, do not distribute modified versions of this code.  If you have
any improvements, send them to me.  That way all changes can be
incorporated into a single program source.

Temporary modifications from Sam Golob, until Art fixes this himself.
These were done with an OK from Art.
       1.  Fixed PRIME macro to branch to the first instruction.
             (Wrong version had been included here.)
       2.  In PRIME changed REGS macro to YREGS, which is distributed
             by IBM with DFP 3.2 and afterwards.
       3.  Added LTORG in all 3 programs to assemble the literal
             =CL8'DATASET' properly.
       4.  Added my own assembly and run JCL members.
       5.  Added CLISTR, CLISTRB, RACCLIST members.  CLISTR is a
             TSO CLIST to run these programs, but the environment
             must be authorized and the program names must be
             entered in IKJTSO00 under AUTHPGM names, or zapped
             into IKJEFTE8 (csect of IKJTABLS) in an authorized
             STEPLIB.  CLISTRB was meant to run under
             TSO-in-batch, so that you could create a special
             IKJTABLS in an authorized STEPLIB that wouldn't
             interfere with your TSO session.  RACCLIST is a
             TSO-in-batch sample job.

The programs herein return the level of access that a third-party
user has to a RACF profile.  There are three versions:

RACCESS5 is for pre-RACF 1.8 users.
RACCESS7 is for user at at least RACF 1.8.
RACCESS6 is for any user, but has been performance tuned for checking
  several profiles for a single userid.  Userids specified after the
  first will be ignored.

RACCESSR is sample execution JCL.
RACCESSS is sample execution JCL from Sam Golob, to add SYSIN DD * etc.
ASM is a sample job to assemble the programs.
ASMCSC is a sample job to assemble the programs from Sam Golob.

All other members (not counting this one) are macros used in the
assembly.

Suggestion:  Replace the "FILEXXX" in member PRIME with the CBT file
number this program is from.  Then you can tell from the object code
where the source came from.

Sample output:

  USERID    CLASS                   RESOURCE NAME                  ACCESS LEVEL
 USER01    DASDVOL   VOLSER                                        NO ACCESS
 USER02    DATASET   SYS1.PROCLIB                                  READ
 USER02    DATASET   SYS1.PARM*                                    NO ACCESS
 USER02    FACILITY  $DASDI.WRK001                                 ALTER
