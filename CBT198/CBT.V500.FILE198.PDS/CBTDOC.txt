Notes:  This code appears also in the JES2 SHARE Mods Tape, Version 99,
        File 140.

        At last, we have a JES2 EXIT 5 routine to load a new version
        of ANY JES2 exit, while JES2 is running.  This routine works
        for all JES2 exits, including JES2 address space, CSA, and
        LPA loaded exits.

        This routine should assemble and work with all JES2 releases
        from MVS/ESA Release 3 through OS/390 releases of JES2.  For
        ESA 3 and ESA 4 releases, there may have to be some slight
        adjustment of the source code necessary, in order to assemble
        cleanly, because of some changes in the format of the $MODULE
        macro, and perhaps, if you use the IEV90 assembler instead of
        ASMA90 (the High Level Assembler).  (IEV90 doesn't accept
        uncommented blank lines.  Put an asterisk in column 1.)

        I've included Bob Break's original exit code, which is called
        HASPEX05, and almost the same code from the JES2 SHARE Tape,
        that was modified slightly by Jack Schudel.  I believe that
        Bob Break requires that the new load module be in an authorized
        link list library, whereas Jack Schudel wanted to drop that
        restriction.  Compare and check the 2 versions yourself.  I've
        included both of them here.  Otherwise, everything on this pds
        is from Bob Break.  (except my few notes - Sam Golob 05/98)

        Now included is a third version of this exit from Yair
        Elharrar which allows the loading of a new exit version from
        an authorized STEPLIB.  This version is member HASPEX5.

        Modification: Yair Elharrar, yair@ashur.cc.biu.ac.il
        This version of the Dynamic Exit Loader will read the
        modules from the JES2 STEPLIB, rather than the LINKLIST.
        The STEPLIB will be opened and closed for each $REPEXIT
        or $ADDEXIT.  Tested on OS/390 2.4 JES2.
