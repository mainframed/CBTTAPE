%------------ DISPLAY and CHANGE GROUP facility (HELP) \-\-
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The%DISPLAY and CHANGE GROUP+panel shows all the RACF groups you belong to.
+
+  Any of these could be your RACF%default+group - the default group is defined
+  as part of your%user profile+on the RACF database.
+
+  Your%CURRENT+group will begin with%NU+because you are logged on to%TSO+
+  This is not necessarily the same as your%default+group.
+
+  If you want to select a%new+default group, select%one+group with an%'S'
+
+  The change will take effect at your%next logon.+
+
+  This utility only lets you select%TSO+groups (which begin with%'NU').
+  You cannot select%NUSSSTS+as it is reserved for the%SSADMIN+function.
+  You cannot select a group ending in%LUS+either.
+
+  New Netview Access options for TSO on IBM1, IBM2 and IBM3 now exist. These
+  allow you to pre-select any of the TSO groups you belong to and work
+  independently of the RACF default. Contact HAYDOCR on MEMO for more details
