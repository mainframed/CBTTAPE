//*                                                                 *   FILE 866
//*     The program reads an input file with SQL/DB2/TSO            *   FILE 866
//*     statements/ commands and executes them. After each SQL      *   FILE 866
//*     the program prints out CPU and TOTAL times what helps to    *   FILE 866
//*     create effective SQL.  You can start SQL statements with    *   FILE 866
//*     special internal commands like WRITE for a SELECT to        *   FILE 866
//*     redirect its report in different formats                    *   FILE 866
//*     (CSV,TAB,ASIS,RPT,...) to a flat file or internal data      *   FILE 866
//*     stacks, or READ for an INSERT to load input into a          *   FILE 866
//*     table.  You can program conditional execution of SQL        *   FILE 866
//*     statements using labels, special variables RCÝn¨ and        *   FILE 866
//*     commands IF,GOTO/SKIP...  See other features of "mySQL      *   FILE 866
