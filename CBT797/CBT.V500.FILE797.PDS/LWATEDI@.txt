                 NOTES ON HOW TO USE LWATEDIT


The LWATEDIT program was written by Dan Dalby, to make it easier to
manipulate your TSO authorization tables, just by editing them.

Ingredients:

1.  Copy the LWAEDIT1 panel to one of your ISPPLIB libraries.

2.  Assemble the LWATEDIT program.  It should NOT be APF-authorized.

3.  Assemble the LWATMGR program.  This program has to have its name
    in the AUTHCMD table (when it is used standalone) and also in the
    AUTHTSF table (so it can be called by IKJEFTSR from the LWATEDIT
    program).

4.  Issue the TSO command LWATEDIT from within ISPF.

5.  You will get the LWAEDIT1 panel, which will ask you to pick which
    table you want to edit.  Place a slash / next to the table you
    want to edit.  Press ENTER.  You will get a list of 8-character
    program names that are in the table.  Do what you want with this
    table, sort it, etc.  When you have finished, if you want to make
    the new names into a new table, enter SAVE.  Otherwise just END.

    If AUTOSAVE is ON in your EDIT profile, then END will create a
    new table, because it has followed an implicit SAVE.  Therefore,
    if you don't want to create a new table, then you have to CANcel
    the EDIT, whenever AUTOSAVE is ON.

6.  If you SAVEd the table and then exit, LWATEDIT will call LWATMGR
    using IKJEFTSR (that's why LWATMGR has to be in AUTHTSF), and
    LWATMGR will update the table with your new SAVEd entries.

7.  Making a new table is easy, just edit the old one with LWATEDIT,
    change it, SAVE it, and exit.  Easy as pie.  Thanks, Dan Dalby!

8.  One further note.  When you are EDITing a table, you can CREATE
    a copy of it, or of part of it, and make an LRECL=8 dataset to
    use against LWATMGR BUILD, or LLWA D, to make a new table at a
    later time.  You can use LWATEDIT to create lists of programs
    for use later.  LWATEDIT is a handy way of making a program list.

9.  My own practice is to make a pds with LRECL=8, and I store a large
    collection of authorization lists there.  So when I use LWATEDIT
    and CREATE an auth table list, I usually save it in the LRECL=8
    pds.  When you do this, you have to remember to include the header
    at the top of the list: "---E2---", "---E8---", "---AP---", or
    "---NS---" so the proper new table will be built from your list
    of program names.


NOTES:

1.  After removing table lengths with TSUB option Z, be VERY CAREFUL
    to make sure that the resulting table has a blank at the end of
    it.  You can use the D option of TSUB to see this.  If there is
    no blank at the end, and no lengths either, the table might pour
    over into subsequent storage which follows it, and there will be
    garbage at the end of the table.  YOU DO NOT WANT TO SAVE THAT!

    One solution:  Use TSUB option B to blank an entry where you think
    the end of the table is.  Then LWATEDIT the table and SAVE it, and
    END.  Then check it again with LWATEDIT to make sure that no
    garbage remains at the table's end.
