                     RC=(15)
                     RC=(R15)
                     RC=(RN)
NAME IS OPTIONAL
RC=  IS FOR RETURN CODE PROCESSING,AND IF NOT APECIFIED,A CODE OF 0 IS RETURNED.
N    LOADS A VALUE OF 'N' INTO R15 BEFORE RETURNING
(R15) OR (15) INDICATES THAT REGISTER 15 ALREADY CONTAINS THE RETURN CODE,AND IS
     NOT TO BE ALTERED
RN   CAUSES REGISTER 'N' TO BE LOADED INTO REGISTER 15 BEFORE RETURNING.THE
