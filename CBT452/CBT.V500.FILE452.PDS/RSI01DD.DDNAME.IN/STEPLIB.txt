)F FUNCTION -
     Dynamically manage the STEPLIB.

     Your STEPLIB can be changed at any time, whether you are in ISPF
     or not.  This command handles all situations.

)X SYNTAX -
     STEPLIB ADD      DATASETS(DSNAME LIST) FIRST|LAST
     STEPLIB ALLOCATE DATASETS(DSNAME LIST)
     STEPLIB DESTACK  DATASETS(DSNAME LIST)
     STEPLIB FREE
     STEPLIB LIST
     STEPLIB REMOVE   DATASETS(DSNAME LIST)
     STEPLIB SAVE
     STEPLIB STACK    DATASETS(DSNAME LIST)
     STEPLIB VERSION
     STEPLIB ...      APFCHK NOMSGS|MSGS

REQUIRED - <function>
DEFAULTS - ALLOCATE FIRST MSGS
ALIAS    - ALLOCATE / OVERRIDE or REPLACE
         - DESTACK  / UNSTACK
         - FREE     / CLOSE
         - REMOVE   / DELETE
         - DATASETS / DSNAMES
         - FIRST    / BEFORE or FRONT
         - LAST     / AFTER or END
         - MSGS     / LOUD or VERBOSE
         - NOMSGS   / QUIET or TERSE

NOTE: The "SHR" and "REUSE" keywords have been added so that this
      command looks like an ALLOCATE command, although these keywords
      are not used.
      I.E. (STEPLIB DA(MY.LOAD) SHR REUSE)

EXAMPLE:
     STEPLIB DA(MY.LOAD 'XYZ.YOUR.LOAD')

Return Codes:
     If the PARSE process fails this will be the IKJPARS return code.

      4 - Specified data set is already in STEPLIB.
      8 - Data set allocation failed.
     12 - APF check failed.
     20 - STEPLIB OPEN failed.
     24 - STEPLIB data set OPEN failed.

)O OPERANDS -
     ADD      - Add a library(s) to the current STEPLIB concatenation.
                If the library already exists within the STEPLIB, the
                command will terminate with a return code of 4.

     ALLOCATE - Build a new STEPLIB allocation list.

     DESTACK  - Eliminate a single occurance of the library(s) from
                the STEPLIB concatenation.

     FREE     - Remove any existing STEPLIB.

     LIST     - Display the current STEPLIB DDNAME & data set names.

     REMOVE   - Eliminate library(s) from the current STEPLIB.

     SAVE     - Create a CLIST variable (&STEPLIB) that contains a
                list of the current STEPLIB data set names.

     STACK    - Add a new instance of the library(s) to the current
                STEPLIB concatenation even if it is already part of the
                current STEPLIB.  This will allow DESTACK to remove a
                single instance without affecting other applications.

     VERSION  - Display the Version and Release of the code as well as
                the assembly date.

     FIRST/LAST - Indicate where the new library(s) are to be added to
                the STEPLIB concatenation.
                The default is to add the new data sets to the beginning
                of the concatenation.

     PAUSE(nnn) - This option is for BATCH processing.  It provides a
                wait time (in seconds) so that the system can perform
                cleanup processing before the step terminates.
                The default is to wait 1 second but this allows the
                user to extend the time if needed.

     APFCHK   - After performing the specified function, all libraries
                in the STEPLIB concatenation are checked to see if they
                are APF authorized.

     NOMSGS   - Do not issue any messages during STEPLIB allocation,
                deallocation or APF checking.
