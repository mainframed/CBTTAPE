    The Dataset Management Facility (DSM) will maintain a list of
    datasets for a user similar to the way a member list is maintained by
    ISPF. Unlike PDF option 3.4, the datasets are specified by the user.
    They do not have to conform to any type of naming conventions nor are
    they required to exist.

    The list of datasets may be manipulated by adding or deleting
    datasets to the list.  This function may be invoked by typing DSM on
    any Command Line under ISPF. This function allows support for
    recursive invocation as well as sharing the list of datasets between
    split screens.
