+      We have assigned the name%"&NTPROB#"+to your problem;
+
+      If you need to contact Network Control in Helena, mentioning this
+      name will help them find a permanent record of it, and speed
+      processing up.  You may want to write a short note, including the
+      name%&NTPROB#+and tape it to the equipment causing the trouble, in
+      case one of your co-workers has to work with Network Control later
+      on, and you don't happen to be around at the time.
+
+      You've gone as far as you can go with Network Tracking/Logging and
+      should return your tube to the point where you started.
+
+      Please press either ENTER or%PF3+("END") when you've read this
+      screen. To back out from that point, you will need to press the
+      %pf3+ ("end") key again, then wait for the word %ready+ to appear
+      on the screen. when it does, type in %logoff+ and press enter.
