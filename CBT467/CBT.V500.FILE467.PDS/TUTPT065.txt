      If the destination printer is a Xerox 2700 Laser Printer, you must
   specify a UDK character for the print output.

      The UDK character is used by the program to denote special
   commands embedded in the text being printed.  These commands include
   bolding, font changes, etc.  So that commands embbeded in the output
   by the program are not accidentally confused with actual text (most
   likely ISPF field definition characters), the UDK character should
   be a character that does not appear in the text of any of the panels
   to be printed.

      Since each analyst uses his or her own standard field definition
   characters, each different set of panels to be printed may have its
   own UDK charater or it may have several possible characters.
   Whichever character is to be used, enter it into the UDK character
   field.
