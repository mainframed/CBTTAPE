CONTENTS OF THIS PDS:

  $BLDLIST -  MACRO - TO BUILD THE PARMLIST FOR A CALLING PROGRAM

  $CAL     -  CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS EXEC DISPLAYS A
              QUICK POP-UP CALENDAR USING ISPF PANEL.  IT ALSO DISPLAYS
              THE LAST AND NEXT MONTH AS WELL.

  $CALMON  -  ISPF PANEL - USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH REXX EXEC $CAL.

  $CKOUT   -  CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS EXEC DISPLAYS PERTINENT
              INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR TSO SESSION OR BATCH JOB, I.E. JOB/STEP
              REGION SIZES, LIMITS, JOB/STEP TIME LIMITS, MSGCLASS, ETC.. THIS
              CAN BE USED TO VERIFY THE SETTINGS DONE BY THE LOCAL JES2 AND SMF
              EXITS.

  $CMDPFX  -  ASM - TO ASSIGN A COMMAND PREFIX TO A MVS IMAGE OF A SYSPLEX.
              RATHER THAN USING THE 'ROUTE' COMMAND, YOU CAN USE THIS PREFIX FOR
              ROUTING A COMMAND TO THE APPROPRIATE SYSTEM.  THE PREFIX IS
              SPECFIED THROUGH PARM.  LOOK AT THE PROGRAM COMMENTS AND SAMPLE
              JCL FOR MORE INFORMATION.

  $CMDPFX# -  JCL - JCL USED TO ASSEMBLE MODULE $CMDPFX. THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES
              APF AUTHORIZATION, AND THEREFORE NEEDS TO BE LINKED (OR COPIED) TO
              AN APF LIBRARY.

  $CMDPFX@ -  JCL - JCL USED TO RUN $CMDPFX.

  $CPU     -  CLIST (EXEC) - THIS IS A CPU MONITOR DISPLAY EXEC.  THE CPU
              UTILIZATION IS DISPLAYED IN GRAPHICAL FORMAT USING ISPF PANELS
              WITH DYNAMIC COLOR.  THE DATA IS WRAPPED AROUND ON THE SCREEN
              FOR COMPARISON.  PRETTY COLORS  !!!

  $CPUPNL  -  ISPF PANEL - USED BY $CPU.

  $D       -  CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS DISPLAYS MVS CONTROL
              BLOCKS, I.E. LINKLIST, APFLIST, SUBSYSTEM NAMES.  THESE ARE THE
              THINGS THAT USED TO BE DONE IN ASSEMBLER CODING.  GOOD EXAMPLE FOR
              CHASING THROUGH MVS CONTROL BLOCKS.  THE HELP TEXT IS BUILT IN AS
              PART OF THE SOURCE.  ANY NEW FUNCTION CAN EASILY BE ADDED.

  $DATE    -  CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS REXX FUNCTION
              DOES DATE CONVERSIONS, INCLUDING RELATIVE DATE USED FOR
              CALCULATION.

  $DO      -  CLIST (EXEC) - EDIT MACRO. THIS EXEC VERIFIES THE 'DO/SELECT-END'
              PAIRINGS IN A REXX EXEC.  ANY HANGING 'DO/SELECT-END' WILL BE
              FLAGGED AS ERROR.  IT ALSO MARKS THE BEGINNING AND END OF EACH
              'DO/SELECT-END' PAIR.  USEFUL IF YOU DO A LOT OF REXX CODING.

  $DISC    -  JUST A DISCLAIMER

  $HISTORY -  QUICK HISTORY OF WHAT IS BEING ADDED TO THIS PDS.

  $INDEX   -  WHAT YOU ARE READING

  $INFO    -  CLIST (EXEC).  THIS IS A GENERAL SRM INFO DISPLAY EXEC.  THE
              CPU UTILIZATION PLUS ALL OTHER SRM INDICATORS ARE SHOWN. ANY
              EXCEPTION CONDITION WILL CHANGE EITHER SOME DISPLAY COLORS OR
              TEXT DISPLAY.  SOME OF THE INFO INCLUDES PAGE FAULT RATE, MIGR
              AGE, AFQ, UIC, ETC...  THE CPU UTIL IS ALSO DISPLAYED IN A
              GRAPHICAL FORMAT.  AGAIN, PRETTY COLORS !!!

  $INFOPNL -  ISPF PANEL - USED BY $INFO.

  $JAD.... -  PANELS - ISPF PANELS USED BY $JAD (JOB ACTIVITY DISPLAY)

  $JAD     -  CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS EXEC GOES THROUGH
              THE ASCB CHAIN AND DISPLAYS JOB ACTIVITY INFO USING ISPF TABLE
              DISPLAY FACILITY, I.E. TCBTIME, EXCPTIME, EXCP COUNT, STORAGE
              USAGE, ETC. IF AN ADDRESS SPACE IS SELECTED, THEN ADDITIONAL INFO
              WILL BE DISPLAYED, INCLUDING A PLOT THAT SHOWS REAL & EXPANDED
              STORAGE, AND ANOTHER WHICH SHOWS ITS STORAGE DISTRIBUTION BASED
              ON UIC (KINDA SHOW YOU HOW REAL MEMORY IS BEING USED AT THE TIME).
              THE DISPLAY CAN BE SORTED AND FILTERED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT KEYS.

              THIS WAS WRITTEN ORIGINALLY TO DISPLAY THE TOTAL STORAGE USED,
              PLUS REAL AND EXPANDED, SEPARATELY FOR THE ADDRESS SPACES. RMFWDM
              (WORKLOAD DELAY MONITOR) ONLY GIVES YOU THE TOTAL, NOT THE OTHER
              TWO, AND DOES NOT ALLOW SORTING.  THIS EXEC, HOWEVER, GIVES ALL
              TOTALS AND LET YOU DO ALL KIND OF SORTING.  NOT ONLY THAT, IT
              ALSO GIVES YOU ADDITIONAL INFO (WHILE I'M LOOKING AROUND AT THE
              CONTROL BLOCKS...).

              ****** SEE $JADPGM ******  NOTE - 3/6/95 ******
              ****** SEE $JADPGM ******  NOTE - 3/6/95 ******

  $JAD#    -  DOC - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION FOR $JAD.

  $JADPGM  -  ASM - ASSEMLER VERSION OF $JAD.  THIS WAS WRITTEN AFTER $JAD IS
              FOUND TO BE TOO SLOW, ESPCIALLY WHEN THE CPU IS CONSTANTLY
              RUNNING ABOVE 100% (SRM CPU BUSY PCT).  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION
              FROM $JAD# TO INSTALL THE REXX VERSION ($JAD), THEN ASSEMBLE
              THIS PROGRAM INTO A LINKLIST A TSO STEPLIB DATA SET.  IF THE
              REXX VERSION IS NOT DESIRED, THEN DO NOT COPY $JAD TO A SYSPROC
              OR SYSEXEC DATA SET.

  $LLACOPY -  SOURCE - BATCH ASSEMBLER PROGRAM TO SELECTIVELY REFRESH A LLA
              (VLF) MODULE.  RATHER THAN DOING A 'F LLA,REFRESH' WHICH MAY TAKE
              A WHILE DEPENDING ON THE LIST OF DATA SETS BEING MANAGED BY LLA,
              THIS PROGRAM WILL UPDATE JUST THE MODULE BEING REFRESHED.  THE
              PROGRAM WILL NEED TO BE LINKED AS AC(1) TO AN APF LIBRARY OR YOU
              CAN INVOKE YOUR OWN SVC (SEVERAL EXIST ON THE CBT TAPE) TO BECOME
              APF AUTHORIZED.  OTHERWISE, THIS PROGRAM WILL ABEND.

  $MPFREPL -  ASM - A GENERALIZED MPF EXIT.  THE MESSAGES BEING HANDLED ARE
              CODED USING AN IN-LINE MACRO.  PROCESSING CAN ALSO BE LIMITED TO
              MESSAGES PRODUCED BY CERTAIN JOBNAMES SPECIFIED BY THIS MACRO.

  $MPFREP# -  JCL - JCL USED TO ASSEMBLE MODULE $MPFREPL. THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES
              APF AUTHORIZATION AND HAS TO BE IN THE LINK LIST AS WELL.

  $MPFREP@ -  INSTRUCTION TO INSTALL THE $MPFREPL EXIT.

  $PARM    -  CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS EXEC TAKES IN
              THE PARMS AND DOES SUBSTITUTION ON THE INPUT CARDS (FROM
              DDNAME INPUT) TO PRODUCE OUTPUT DATA FOR SUBSEQUENT USAGE.
              SEVERAL RESERVED SYMBOLS WILL BE SUBSTITUTED AS WELL, I.E.
              ~JOBNAME~, ~SYSID~.  REXX FUNCTIONS WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED
              TO PRODUCE THE OUTPUT IF CODED (THIS CAN BE JUST ANOTHER
              EXTERNAL REXX FUNCTION LIKE $DATE)

  $PARM#   -  JCL - SAMPLE JCL TO RUN $PARM.

  $Q       -  EDIT MACRO (REXX) - THIS MACRO TAKES A PARM AS A TSO
              COMMAND TO BE ISSUED AND THE OUTPUT WILL BE TRAPPED AND
              DISPLAYED AS ISPF EDIT NOTE LINES.

  $SAVE    -  EDIT MACRO (REXX) - THIS MACRO SAVES DATA BEING EDITED BY
              DOING UPDATE IN PLACE FOR A PDS MEMBER.  EXTREMELY USEFUL
              IF SYS1.PROCLIB IS FULL, AND YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE MINIMUM
              CHANGES TO A PROC (UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND
              COMPRESS IT RIGHT THEN AND THERE ...)

  $VSAMIDX -  CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS EXEC CALCULATES
              THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF INDEX BUFFERS TO BE SPECIFIED FOR A VSAM
              KSDS USED FOR RANDOM ACCESS.  THE THEORY HERE IS: IF YOU CAN
              KEEP ALL INDEX RECORDS IN MEMORY, THEN NO FURTHER IO'S WILL BE
              REQUIRED ONCE THE BUFFERS ARE FILLED.  NOTE THAT, FOR SEQUENTIAL
              ACCESS, THE NUMBER DOES NOT APPLY, SINCE ONLY THE SEQUENCE SET
              INDEX RECORDS WILL BE USED.  IN THIS CASE, SPECIFYING A FEW
              EXTRA DATA BUFFERS WOULD HELP.

  $VSAMIXA -  CLIST (EXEC) - THE DFSMS 1.X VERSION OF $VSAMIDX.

  $VSDOC   -  INSTALL DOC FOR $VSAMIDX.

  $VSIDX01 -  PANEL - ISPF PANEL USED BY $VSAMIDX.

  $WHOHAS  -  CLIST (EXEC) - THIS REXX EXEC WILL LIST THE ACCESS LISTS
              FOR RACF DATA SET PROFILES FOUND UNDER DSN*.**.  THIS
              FUNCTION IS VERY MUCH SIMILAR TO 'TSS WHOHAS DSN' COMMAND
              UNDER TOP SECRET.  IF THE EXEC IS RUN IN BATCH, THE RACF
              COMMANDS USED TO RE-BUILD ALL OF THE PROFILES AS DISPLAYED
              IN THE OUTPUT IS ALSO PRODUCED.

  $X       -  EDIT MACRO (REXX) - THIS MACRO READS THE MEMBER BEING
              EDITED AND EXECUTES IT AS A CLIST/EXEC.  EXECUTION PARMS
              ARE ALLOWED AS WELL.  THIS DOES NOT REQUIRED THE MEMBER TO
              BE SAVED FIRST.  EXTREMELY USEFUL IF YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF
              CLIST/EXEC CODING AND DEBUGGING.

  $6       -  CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  OFTEN TIMES, YOU DO NEED
              TO ALLOCATE A NEW LOADLIB AND EXECUTE TSO COMMANDS OUT OF IT.
              ONE WAY TO DO IT IS: GET OUT OF ISPF, ALLOCATE IT AS ISPLLIB,
              AND GET BACK IN.  THE OTHER WAY (WITHOUT HAVING TO GET OUT
              OF ISPF): EXECUTE THIS EXEC, AND THERE YOU GO !!!  IF YOU WERE
              AN ISPF BIGGOT, YOU'D HAVE THIS EXEC DONE ALREADY (PROBABLY).
              BUT HECK, I PUT THIS IN HERE ANY WAY...

  $6DOC    -  INSTALL DOC FOR $6.

  #LLACOPY -  JCL - JCL USED TO RUN PROGRAM $LLACOPY.

  @DYNA    -  HELP MEMBER FOR TSO COMMAND 'DYNALIST'.  NEEDS TO BE RENAMED TO
              'DYNALIST' BEFORE MOVING IT TO 'SYS1.HELP'.

  @FIND    -  HELP MEMBER FOR TSO COMMAND 'FIND'.  NEEDS TO BE RENAMED TO 'FIND'
              BEFORE MOVING IT TO 'SYS1.HELP'.

  @JADPGM  -  JCL USED TO ASSEMBLE $JADPGM.

  @TSOINIT -  HELP MEMBER FOR TSO COMMAND 'TSOINIT'.  NEEDS TO BE RENAMED TO
              'TSOINIT' BEFORE MOVING IT TO 'SYS1.HELP'.

  ASSEM    -  GENERAL JCL USED TO ASSEMBLE THE PROGRAMS/COMMANDS:  DALLOC,
              DYNALIST, FIND, TSOINIT.

  DALLOC   -  SOURCE - TSO CMD TO DISPLAY DYNAMIC ALLOCATIONS.  I'VE GOT THE
              ORIGINAL SOURCE FROM ONE OF THE VERY OLD CBT TAPE.  THIS STOPPED
              WORKING WHEN OUR JES2 PGMR DECIDED TO MOVE SWA ABOVE THE LINE.  I
              THEN DECIDED TO FIX THIS PROGRAM USING MACRO 'SWAREQ' WHICH IS THE
              STANDARD WAY TO ACCESS THE JFCB FROM TIOT PTR.

  DATE     -  THIS IS JES2 EXIT 1 (PAGE SEPARATOR), BUT REALLY IT IS CSECT
              RBDDATE WHICH IMPLEMENTS TABLELESS DATE CONVERSION

  DYNALIST -  SOURCE - TSO COMMAND TO DISPLAY ALL UNIT NAMES ON THE SYSTEM AND
              THE UCBS' (PLUS VOLSERS) ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE UCBS.  DYNALIST IS
              AN OLD PROGRAM COMING OFF THE CBT TAPE.  I MODIFIED IT SINCE WE
              WENT TO MVS 3.1.0E.  NOW THAT WE ARE AT MVS 4.2, IT STOPS WORKING
              AGAIN.  DUE TO THE CHANGES TO THE IOCP PROCESS (ONLINE HCDS), I
              DECIDED TO RE-WRITE THIS PROGRAM USING MORE STANDARD MVS
              INTERFACES THAN THE OLD MODULE.  ALONG THE WAY, I ALSO ADDED SOME
              NEW BELLS AND WHISTLES.  AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, THIS SHOULD
              ALSO WORK WITH MVS 3.1.0E.

  ENQMON   -  SOURCE - ASM PROGRAM USED AS A STC TO MONITOR AND DISPLAY GRS
              ENQ CONTENTION. THIS PROGRAM DOES GQSCAN EVERY MINUTE, DISPLAYS
              THE HOLDERS/WAITERS ON THE CONSOLE.  IF THE HOLDER IS A TSU USER,
              A MESSAGE WILL BE SENT TO NOTIFY THE USER.  EVERY MINUTE, THE
              CONSOLE DISPLAYED MESSAGE WILL BE UN-HILIGHTED, THE MINUTE COUNT
              INCREMENTS, AND A NEW MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED.  THE WAITING JOB WILL
              ALSO RECEIVE MESSAGES AS PART OF THE JOBLOG.  THIS PROGRAM TRIES
              TO MIMICK MIM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE JOB
              REQUEUE FUNCTION.

  ENQMON#  -  JCL - JCL USED TO ASSEMBLE MODULE ENQMON. THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES
              APF AUTHORIZATION.

  ENQMON$  -  JCL - JCL USED TO RUN ENQMON AS A STARTED TASK.

  EXIT     -  MACRO - TO EXIT A PROGRAM

  FIND     -  SOURCE - TSO CMD TO DO QUICK SEARCH FOR ANY CHARACTER STRING IN A
              PDS.  HAS A FEW NICE OPTIONS.  LOOK AT @FIND FOR HELP.

  IEFUTL   -  MULTI FUNCTION, SEMI-SMART, TABLE DRIVEN TIMEOUT PROCESSOR

  IEFUTLTB -  THE TABLE IT USES

  ISRTSOA  -  PANEL - THE 'MODIFIED OPTION 6' PANEL USED BY $6.

  JESXIT05 -  JES2 COMMAND EXIT TO DO THE FOLLOWING:

              $Q'XXX    -  DISPLAYS ALL JOBS PREFIXED BY XXX
              $QAPF     -  DISPLAYS APF LIST
              $QLLT     -  DISPLAYS LINKLIST TABLE
              $QDSN=XXX -  CATALOG SEARCH DSNAME XXX.  IF FOUND, THE CATALOGED
                           VOLUME IS ALSO SEARCHED TO MAKE SURE DATA SET DOES
                           RESIDE THERE.
              $QVOL=YYY -  DISPLAYS UCB ADDR OF VOL=YYY.  IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND
                           THIS OUT USING NATIVE MVS COMMANDS.
              $QSYSTEM  -  DISPLAYS ALL KIND OF INFO ABOUT SYSTEM.  GOOD FOR US
                           SYSTEMS PROGRAMMERS.
              $Q        -  DISPLAYS AVAILABLE PARMS (AS ABOVE)

              THIS CODE WAS WRITTEN FOR JES2 4.2 (MVS/ESA 4.2), FOR ANY EARLIER
              VERSION OF JES2, YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE MACRO 'CONVCON' TO GO
              CHECK THE CONSOLE YOURSELF.  ALSO, '$CFJMSG' WAS USED TO PRODUCE
              THE EXACT DISPLAY THAT '$D' DOES (THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTED MACRO
              IN JES2 MANUAL).  THE WAY THIS PROGRAM IS WRITTEN, YOU CAN EASILY
              ADD A NEW PARM AND WRITE A NEW SECTION OF CODE TO PROCESS THAT
              PARM.  PLANNED MODIFICATIONS FOR FUTURE:

                 *   FIX UP THE MACRO USED TO SET UP THE PARAMETER TABLE.  RIGHT
                     NOW, THE HELP TEXT HAS TO BE LESS THAN 60 CHAR SINCE THE
                     BUFFER AREA USED FOR DISPLAY IS 60 CHAR LONG (MAY CAUSE
                     SOME OVERLAY IF IT IS LONGER).

              JES2 PARMS NEEDED:

              *   LOADMOD(JESXIT05)
              *   EXIT(005) ROUTINE=EXIT5,STATUS=ENABLED,TRACE=NO

  JESX006  -  JES2 INTERNAL TEXT SCAN, TABLE DRIVEN, IMPLEMENTS CONTROLS ON
              NUMBER OF TAPE DRIVES PER STEP.

  JSTAT    -  SOURCE - BATCH PROGRAM TO CHECK AND SEE IF A JOB (OR STC OR TSU)
              IS CURRENTLY RUNNING (USING THE 'STATUS' FUNCTION OF JES2).  IF IT
              IS FOUND, THEN WTO'S WILL BE DONE USING CONTROL CARDS IN 'FND'.
              OTHERWISE, CONTROL CARDS FROM 'NOTFND' DDNAME WILL BE USED BY
              WTO'S.  IF 'RRFND' AND 'RRNOTFND' ARE USED, A WTOR WILL BE DONE
              AFTER THE WTO'S TO GIVE THE OPERATOR A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
              BEFORE THE REPLY.  OF COURSE, NONE OF THE DDNAMES HAS TO BE
              PRESENT, IN WHICH CASE, THE APPROPRIATE RETURN CODE WILL BE ISSUED
              BASED ON THE JOB STATUS.  NOTE THAT SINCE THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT GO
              THROUGH THE ASVT, AND THEREFORE DOES WORK IN A JES2 SHARED SPOOL
              ENVIRONMENT.

  JSTAT#   -  JCL - JCL USED TO ASSEMBLE MODULE JSTAT.  THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES
              APF AUTHORIZATION, AND THEREFORE NEEDS TO BE LINKED (OR COPIED) TO
              AN APF LIBRARY.

  JSTAT$   -  JCL - JCL USED TO RUN JSTAT.

  LOCKTERM -  TSO COMMAND TO LOCK A SCREEN WITH A PASSWORD

  MFORM    -  MACRO USED IN LOCKTERM

  MSIXBIT  -  MACRO USED IN LOCKTERM

  M3270    -  MACRO USED IN LOCKTERM

  SEEK     -  SOURCE - TSO CMD TO DO QUICK SEARCH FOR ANY MODULE THAT RESIDES IN
              LPA (MLPT/FLPA/PLPA), LINKLIST, AND/OR STEPLIB.  MODULE
              INFORMATION WILL BE DISPLAYED ACCORDINGLY IF FOUND.

  SET      -  MACRO - TO SET UP SAVE AREA AT BEGINNING OF PROGRAM

  TSOINIT  -  SOURCE - TSO CMD TO CHECK FOR A FEW ISPF DATA SETS AND ALLOCATE
              THEM AS 'NEW' IF THEY ARE NOT FOUND IN THE CATALOGS.  THESE DATA
              SET NAMES ARE RECORDED IN A TABLE OF THIS PROGRAM.  THE FIRST DATA
              SET QUALIFIER WILL BE THE SAME WITH THE EXECUTING TSO ID.  I GUESS
              YOU CAN DO ALL THIS USING 'ALLOC' COMMAND WITH RETURN CODE
              CHECKING, BUT, THIS IS PROBABLY A LOT MORE EFFICIENT ....  ALSO, I
              AM TOO LAZY TO WRITE A MACRO TO CREATE A NAME ENTRY IN THE DATA
              SET NAME TABLE.  MAYBE SOMEONE WILL DO THAT FOR ME ....
