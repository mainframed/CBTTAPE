              SOME REMARKS ON THE CLIST CONVERSION PROGRAM


Please see change notes at the bottom .

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

      This program (CVTCLIST) converts CLIST libraries from the fixed
blocked (LRECL=80) format to the variable blocked (LRECL=255) format,
and vice-versa.  Whole libraries are converted at once.

      The SYSUT1 (input) file and the SYSUT2 (output) file are examined
by the program to make sure that one of them is in the FB-80 format
and the other is in the VB-255 format.  The program then converts the
SYSUT1 library into the format of the SYSUT2 library appropriately.

      This program used to work best if the output (SYSUT2) dataset
is empty of members.  (But this is not necessary any more in Version
2.1.  Now a STOW with replace is done, instead of a STOW with add.)

      In Version 2.1, many enhancements were done in the reporting
capability of this program.  Individual member reporting is done,
dataset names and titles appear at the head of each page.  The summary
report has been enhanced.

      In Version 2.1, you can merge many CLIST libraries into one
library as you convert.  Since in this version, replacement in the
"to" library IS ALWAYS DONE, you should merge a concatenation FROM
THE BOTTOM UP.  A separate report is created for each library
converted.  Both the "from" and "to" libraries are shown at the top
of each page of each report.  That eliminates confusion during a
large conversion effort, about which libraries the report is referring
to.


Sample conversion JCL follows:


//TSTBCP2V JOB (TS,2322),'TECH.SUPPORT',CLASS=M,NOTIFY=TSTBSSG,
//        MSGLEVEL=(1,1),MSGCLASS=T TYPRUN=HOLD
//*
//*****************************************************************//
//* CONVERT CLISTS FROM FB - 80 TO VB -255 FORMAT AND VICE-VERSA  *//
//*****************************************************************//
//*
//CNVTSTEP EXEC PGM=CVTCLIST,REGION=5900K
//STEPLIB  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=TST.TSO.CMDLIB
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1 DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.SMGR.CLIST         <=== HAPPENS TO BE VB
//SYSUT2 DD DISP=SHR,DSN=TSTBSSG.FB.SMGR.CLIST   <=== HAPPENS TO BE FB
//

      Some version of this program has been on the CBT Tape (file 187)
for some time.  There had been many bugs involved with it, especially
in the process of converting in the VB to the FB direction, where the
long lines have to be folded.  I removed a bug that made the program
run away under some circumstances, and I tried to make it so that the
converted CLISTs were identical in FUNCTION, if not in exact form
(byte for byte) as the original.  I think I'm pretty close for most
CLISTs.  (See LOGIC notes further down.)

      If VB CLISTs have long lines (longer than 72 data characters),
then the excess is folded to the next line, in the FB-converted image.
When that FB-format library is re-converted to VB using this program,
the long lines are not reconstructed.  Therefore VB-to-FB-to-VB
comparison may show folding of lines, while FB-to-VB-to-FB compares
should be expected to correspond byte for byte, except for sequence
numbers.  Please report any exceptions to me.

      My great hope is that this conversion program will help people
convert CLISTs easily, instead of by the laborious means usually
used, whether IBM-in-origin or otherwise.  The main thing is that the
new CLISTs execute the same actions, exactly, as the old (no warranty
express or implied here--use on your own responsibility, not mine or
my installation's.)

      Good luck.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Line splitting logic for VB to FB conversion:

      The idea of the line splitting logic, when converting CLISTs
from long-line (VB-255) format to short-line (FB-80) format was
to allow all converted CLISTs to execute exactly as they executed
before.  This was (hopefully) accomplished by NOT MAKING ANY
DECISIONS REGARDING INDENTATION.

      Line splitting logic is as follows:   Length of a line in VB
format is determined by looking at the RDW.  Trailing blanks are not
examined.  (Maybe this should change.)  Lines whose data is exactly
72 bytes long, are not split.  Lines whose data is 73 bytes or more,
are split at column 71.  A dash is placed in column 72.  That line
is continued in column 1 of a newly-inserted output record.  71 is
subtracted from that line's "length" and the same logic is recursively
applied if that line is long enough to be split further.

      Again, the idea is not that the converted CLIST should look
pretty.  It should EXECUTE CORRECTLY.  When you are converting
thousands of CLISTs in your shop, you don't want to cause any
disturbances in anyone's activities.  Users who want their CLISTs
to look pretty, can go back and fix their own stuff on an individual
basis.

      This program makes it possible to easily convert the CLIST
formats of any shop.  Now, YOU ARE NOT "FROZEN" IN ANY ONE CLIST
FORMAT.

01/17/90 - Minor change added.  Sequence numbers now are 100-100
SBG        instead of 10-10.  This helps to make the output CLISTs
           to be considered NUMBERED under the ISPF/PDF editor.
           A "difference" member is included to show the four line
           code change.

10/09/90 - Version 2.0 with member replacement and individual member
SBG        reporting capability added.

10/17/90 - Version 2.1 - New features. - Alias members that are changed
SBG        to real members upon conversion are flagged and totaled.
           ISPF stats for members that required line splits are changed
           in the size to add the number of splits.  Dataset names of
           the input and output libraries are reported on each page.
           Page numbers and page ejects with titles have been added
           to the reports.  Counts of line splits for each member,
           are reported if they have been done (VB to FB conversion
           only).  Totals of line splits, converted aliases are
           reported.  (Line splits are reported for VB to FB only,
           which is the case in which this makes sense.)

11/27/90 - Version 2.2 - New features. - Flag records in VB CLISTs
SBG        having numerics in data columns 81-88.  These are probably
           leftover sequence numbers from a previous conversion from
           FB to VB by hand.

           Fixed bug caused when alias member reporting was introduced.
           Members were wrongly dropped after alias members were
           processed.  One line fix after the two MVC instructions
           following the label GETMEM.

         NI    11(R8),X'9F'             PRESERVE ALIAS IND IF THERE SBG
         MVC   DIRLIST+11(63),11(R8)    MOVE USER DATA TO DIRLIST
         MVC   NAME,0(R8)               PUT NAME IN OUTPUT DIRECT LIST
 add >>> NI    11(R8),X'1F'    KEEP ONLY USERDATA SIZE BITS   11/90 SBG
         SR    R12,R12                  CLEAR REGISTER
