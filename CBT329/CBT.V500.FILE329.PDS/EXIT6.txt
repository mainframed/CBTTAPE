**********************************************************************
*
*    ENVIRONMENT   MVS SP 2.1.3           LEVEL 8502
*                  JES2 FOR SP 1.3.4      LEVELSET 8501
*                  ACF2 4.0 (SKK INC.)
*
*    THIS JES2 EXIT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RUN AT CONVERTER
*    TIME TO ENFORCE INSTALLATION JCL STANDARDS AND TO DETERMINE
*    THE APPROPRIATE JOB CLASS BASED ON DEVICE UTILIZATION.
*
*    VIOLATIONS OF JCL STANDARDS ARE DOCUMENTED BY MESSAGES
*    WRITTEN TO THE JES2 MESSAGE DATA SET FOR THE JOB AND
*    FLAGGED FOR JCL ERROR BY THE USE OF THE JES2 EXIT RETURN
*    CODE TO THE JES2 CONVERTER SUB-TASK.
*
*    THIS EXIT USES THE INTERNAL TEXT DATA SET FOR ITS
*    PROCESSING. JES2 PASSES EACH INTERNAL TEXT STATEMENT
*    TO THIS EXIT FOR EXAMINATION AND/OR MODIFICATION. THE
*    EXIT WILL MAINTAIN A TABLE OF DATASET NAMES AND DEVICE
*    COUNTS TO BE USED AT END OF PROCESSING FOR DETERMINING
*    JOB CLASS. THE ACB FOR THE MESSAGE DATA SET IS IN THE
*    PCE WORK AREA AND CAN BE USED TO ISSUE ERROR MESSAGES
*    TO THE JOB MESSAGE PORTION OF THE LISTING.
*
*    ALSO, THE CONVERTER IS A DUMB ANIMAL WHEN IT COMES TO
*    SYNTAX CHECKING. CHECKING IS MADE FOR KEYWORD VALUES,
*    BUT NONE IS MADE ON THE VALUE FOR THE KEYWORD. IE.,
*    50 CHARACTER DATA SET NAMES, 20 CHARACTER VOLUME SERIAL
*    NUMBERS, AND NUMEROUS SYNTAX ERRORS CAN PASS UNDETECTED
*    THROUGH THE CONVERTER. THESE ERRORS WILL BE CAUGHT BY
*    THE INTERPRETER WHEN THE JOB GOES INTO EXECUTION, BUT
*    THIS EXIT MUST PROCESS THEM. CURRENTLY, ALL ERRORS OF
*    THIS TYPE WILL ISSUE A MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT OF AN INTERNAL
*    ERROR AND FLUSH THE JOB.
