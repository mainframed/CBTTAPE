* FUNCTION -   PRINT THE DATA PASSED TO IT.  IT WILL USE THE DDNAME   *
*              SYSOUT IF IT IS ALLOCATED, AND WILL USE THE VTOCMSG    *
*              ROUTINE IF NOT.  IT CAN ALSO PUT OUT THE DATA TO       *
*              AN OUTPUT DATA SET.  TOTALS ARE COMPUTED HERE.         *
*                                                                     *
* OPERATION -  FOR UNSORTED DATA, GET THE CURRENT ENTRY, ADD TO THE   *
*              TOTALS, AND OUTPUT IT.  IF THE DATA IS SORTED, THE     *
*              ACTION IS MORE COMPLEX, BECAUSE ALL THE DATA SETS      *
*              ARE TO BE OUTPUT.  THE TOTALS AND BREAKS MAY BE        *
*              NEEDED AT ANY POINT.                                   *

*              THEIR ATTRIBUTES, WITH TOTALS AND BREAKS AS NEEDED.    *
*              ALSO TO THE OUTPUT DATA SET, IF NEEDED.  IF SYSOUT     *
*              IS NOT ALLOCATED, VTOCMSG IS USED FOR OUTPUT.          *
