))NOHEADING   - DO NOT PRODUCE A HEADING.  THE HEADING WILL ONLY BE
              OUTPUT IF THE VTOCOUT DD STATEMENT IS PRESENT.
))HEADING('TEXT') - IF A DD STATEMENT WITH A DDNAME OF VTOCOUT IS
              PRESENT, THIS TEXT WILL BE USED TO BEGIN EVERY PAGE.
              CARRIAGE CONTROL SHOULD BE INCLUDED ( ASA ).  THE

              DEFAULT IS TO PRODUCE ONE FINAL TOTAL LINE.
))DSNLEN('LENGTH') - SPECIFIES THE LENGTH OF THE DSNAME TO PRINT.
              THE REST OF THE DSNAME IS TRUNCATED.  THE CHARS PARAMETER
              WILL ALSO CAUSE THE DSNAME TO BE TRUNCATED, IF THE NAME
              AND THE PRECEDING INFORMATION EXCEEDS THE PRINT LINE.
))NOPRINT     - SPECIFIES THAT INDIVIDUAL ITEMS ARE NOT TO BE LISTED.
              THE COMMAND CAN BE USED TO CALCULATE TOTALS.
))PRINT('PRINT-OP' ('PRINT-ITEM-LIST')) -

              OPERATION TO BE DONE.  THEY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.
                NEW - THE 'PRINT-ITEM-LIST' IS A COMPLETE LIST OF WHAT
                      TO PRINT.
                REP - THE FIRST 'PRINT-ITEM' WILL BE REPLACED WITH THE
                      REST OF THE ITEMS ON THE LIST.
                ADD - THE REST OF THE 'PRINT-ITEM-LIST' WILL BE ADDED
                      AFTER THE FIRST ITEM ON THE LIST.
                DEL - THE ITEMS ON THE 'PRINT-ITEM-LIST' WILL NOT BE
                      PRINTED.

              THE 'PRINT-ITEM-LIST' NAMES ARE THE SAME KEYWORDS USED
              IN LIM, AND, AND OR FUNCTIONS AND ARE ALSO THE TITLES

              NOTE: IF CCHH IS CHOOSEN IT DEFAULTS TO THE CCHH RANGE
              OF THE FIRST EXTENT; HOWEVER, IF LIM/AND/OR SELECTION
              IS PERFORMED, THE CCHH RANGE OF THE EXTENT WHICH
