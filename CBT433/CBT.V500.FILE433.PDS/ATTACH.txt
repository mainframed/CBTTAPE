/* REXX   ATTACH      a routine to perform LOGON-time customization of a
                      TSO user environment, especially as regards file
                      allocations.

   Some files are pre-allocated; an input file will provide additional
   information in the following form:
      ATTACH  filename dsname (AHEAD, BEHIND, UNIQUE, FIRST, LAST, ONLY)
      DETACH  filename dsname
      DROP    filename
      INCLUDE dsname
      TSO     CLIST or REXX EXEC
      REXX    executable-command
   The default primary input file is member 'START' from the caller's
   ISPF.PROFILE dataset.

.  Process:
        Each command will be processed in the order encountered, except
               that all INCLUDE statements and nested INCLUDEs must
               first be expanded.
        All allocations will be collected and processed together.
.       Begin: determine all existing allocations; process each ATTACH,
               DETACH, DROP, and INCLUDE statement found in the command
               stack;
.       ATTACH: the dsname specified is first removed (if it exists in
                the allocation for the filename) and then inserted
                either at the head of the sequence or at the tail;
.       DETACH: the dsname specified is removed (if it exists in the
                allocation for the filename)
.       DROP:   the file specified is FREEd.
.       INCLUDE: the dsname specified is presumed to contain ATTACH,
                DETACH, DROP, TSO, REXX, and INCLUDE commands; it is
                read into the command stack where found.  Because of the
                possibility of nested INCLUDEs, the presence of an
                INCLUDE requires the stack to be reprocessed.
.       TSO/    indicates a command to be stored for execution after
.       REXX:   all the allocations are finalized.  The command must be
                executable as written.  TSO statements are executed
                in-line after all allocations complete; REXX statements
                are interpreted for execution as the last task of
                ATTACH.

     Modification History
     19990922 fxc added call to EXECUTIL and NOOP to force SYSEXEC
                  closed so that ATTACH may be re-run; RXSKLY2K;
     19991021 fxc added FIRST=AHEAD, ONLY=UNIQUE, LAST=BEHIND
     19991122 fxc upgrade from v.19980225 to v.19991109;
     20010327 fxc add external logging

.  Read the base command file and examine for the presence of INCLUDE
   commands.  For any INCLUDE, read the file specified and insert the
   contents directly to the bottom of the queue.
.  ATTACH, DETACH, and DROP commands can be re-written at the bottom of
   the original queue.
.  REXX and TSO commands are to be stored for later use.

   Notes on the use of the QUEUE:
   - a 'do queued()' is evaluated once at the start of the loop and is
     not re-evaluated if lines are later added to the queue.
   - sw.0continue is set ON by a call to CA_; this causes a later
     re-evaluation of the 'do queued()' if lines are added.
   - result: if an INCLUDE is found, the text of the referenced dataset
     replaces the INCLUDE and the stack is flagged for reprocessing;
     thus, if an INCLUDE points to a nested INCLUDE, the nested include
     is loaded and processed as if its text were coded as part of the
     base command file.
