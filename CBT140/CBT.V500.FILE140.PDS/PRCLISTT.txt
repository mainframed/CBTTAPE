+ Selecting option%LIST+will produce a report of all datasets that have been
+ archived (migrated) from online (disk) storage to offline tape storage.
+ Data processing automatically migrates, on a quarterly basis, all data
+ that has been unreferenced within the previous year. To recover archived
+ data, perform the following steps:
+
+   1. After browsing the report produced by option%LIST+, press PF3.
+      Note that the report dataset "ARCHIVED.DATASETS" is dynamically
+      re-created each time the "LIST" function is requested.
+   2. Select a print option from the next presented menu.
+      (The LIST function uses SPF's 3.6 HARDCOPY utility to print the rpt.)
+   3. Present the hardcopy report to the data processing computer
+      operator, indicating the desired dataset(s) to be restored.
+      Data processing will notify you upon restore completion.
