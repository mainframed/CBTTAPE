       CXYPSCAN IS A HIGH SPEED SCAN AND PRINT UTILITY DEVELOPED BY
  FRANK JOHNSTON AT U.S. ARMY HDQ DESCOM IN THE LATE 1970'S AND 1980'S.
  FILES TO BE SCANNED/PRINTED ARE PARTITIONED DATA SETS(PDSES) WITH
  RECFM OF F FB V OR VB AND LRECL BETWEEN 50 AND 255 BYTES. ANY NUMBER
  OF SUCH FILES CAN BE INPUT TO ONE BATCH EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM AND
  UP TO 255 ARGUMENTS CAN BE SEARCHED FOR. EXTENSIVE PRINT FACILITIES
  ARE PROVIDED TO SHOW THE USER ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE
  RUN.


************************************************************************
*                   MODES OF EXECUTION                                 *
************************************************************************
       THE PROGRAM MAY BE EXECUTED IN THREE MODES.
             1. IN NORMAL BATCH MODE USING THE BATCH JCL SHOWN BELOW.
             2. IN TSO FOREGROUND MODE BY EXECUTING CLIST PSCAN IN WHICH
             THE TERMINAL USER WILL BE PROMPTED FOR THE FILE TO BE
             SCANNED AND THE ARGUMENTS TO BE SEARCHED FOR.
             3. IN STARTED TASK MODE BY STARTING PROC PDSSCAN FROM THE
             MVS MASTER CONSOLE IN WHICH CASE THE CONSOLE OPERATOR WILL
             INDICATE THE FILE TO BE SEARCHED ON THE START COMMAND,
             AND WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER THE SEARCH ARGUMENTS VIA
             WTORS.


       THE FOLLOWING ARE THE JCL REQUIREMENTS FOR A BATCH EXECUTION.

************************************************************************
*                   LOGICAL SEARCH METHODS.                            *
************************************************************************
       THERE ARE FIVE LOGICAL WAYS TO SEARCH FOR HITS.
             1. 'OR' (THE DEFAULT). A MEMBER WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE
             FOUND IF ANY OF THE ENTERED ARGUMENTS ARE FOUND.
             2. 'AND' (SPECIFIED BY PARM='AND' ON THE EXEC CARD).
             A MEMBER WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE FOUND IF ALL THE
             ENTERED ARGUMENTS ARE FOUND.
             3. 'AND' WITH EXCLUSIONS (SPECIFIED BY PARM='AND' ON THE
             EXEC CARD AND AN E IN COLUMN 5 OF THE CONTROL CARD/S).
             A MEMBER WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE FOUND IF ALL THE REGULAR
             ARGUMENTS ARE FOUND AND NONE OF THE EXCLUDED ARGUMENTS
             ARE FOUND.
             4. 'RECORD' (SPECIFIED BY PARM='RECORD' OR 'REC' ON THE
             EXEC CARD) A MEMBER WILL BE CONSIDERED FOUND IF ALL THE
             ENTERED ARGUMENTS ARE FOUND WITHIN A LOGICAL RECORD.
             THIS IS EFFECTIVELY 'AND' LOGIC AT THE RECORD RATHER
             THAN MEMBER LEVEL.
             5. 'RECORD' WITH EXCLUSIONS (SPECIFIED BY PARM='RECORD'
             OR 'REC' ON THE EXEC CARD AN E IN COLUMN 5 OF THE CONTROL
             CARD/S).
             A MEMBER WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE FOUND IF ALL THE REGULAR
             ARGUMENTS ARE FOUND AND NONE OF THE EXCLUDED ARGUMENTS ARE
             FOUND WITHIN ONE OR MORE LOGICAL RECORDS WITHIN THE MEMBER.


************************************************************************
*                   BATCH MODE DD CARDS.                               *
************************************************************************
       IN BATCH MODE PDSES TO BE SCANNED ARE SPECIFIED VIA //PROC
       AND/OR //PDS DD CARDS. CXYPSCAN WILL SEARCH ITS TIOT FOR ANY
       DDNAME BEGINNING WITH PROC OR PDS AND SCAN THESE FILES IF THEY
       ARE PDSES WITH F FB V OR VB RECFM WITH LRECL BETWEEN 50 AND
       255 BYTES. SPECIFY A UNIQUE DDNAME FOR EACH PDS TO BE SCANNED.
       CXYPSCAN DOES NOT SUPPORT CONCATENATED DATA SETS BECAUSE THE
       DSNS AND VOLSERS CANNOT BE RETRIEVED FROM THE INTERNAL MVS
       CONTROL BLOCKS FOR PRINT. //PROC AND //PDS ARE COMPLETELY
       INTERCHANGEABLE AND EITHER PREFIX MAY BE USED WITH ANY SUFFIX
       FOR ANY PDS.


************************************************************************
*                   PRINTED OUTPUT.                                    *
************************************************************************
       THE PRINT OUTPUT IS DIRECTED TO THREE SYSOUT DATA SETS.
             1. THE //MESSAGE DD CARD CAN RECEIVE SEVERAL TYPES OF
       MESSAGES AND WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOME OUTPUT. AT A MINIMUM A MESSAGE
       WILL BE ISSUED INDICATING THE FAILURE TO SCAN ANY FILES BECAUSE
       OF A RUN-WIDE FAILURE (I.E. BAD PARAMETER/S PRESENT, NO VALID
       ARGUMENTS ENTERED, OR NO VALID DDNAMES PRESENT). ON RUNS WHERE
       SCANS ARE PERFORMED THE INFORMATION ABOUT EACH ARGUMENT ENTERED
       IS PRINTED BEFORE ANY SCANS ARE PERFORMED. ALSO AFTER ALL SCANS
       ARE FINISHED THE OPTIONS IN EFFECT FOR THE RUN ARE SHOWN. IN
       ADDITION FOR EACH PDS PROCESSED INFORMATION IS PRINTED ABOUT THE
       FILE SCANNED ALONG WITH COUNTS OF MEMBERS AND RECORDS PROCESSED.
       IF THERE ARE ANY HITS IN THE PDS COUNTS OF HITS AND POINTERS INTO
       THAT PORTION OF THE //SYSPRINT FILE THAT PERTAIN TO THE PDS IS
       PRINTED. IF THERE ARE NO HITS A MESSAGE TO THAT EFFECT IS SHOWN.
       IN EITHER CASE 2 MESSAGES ARE PROVIDED SHOWING THE ELAPSED WALL
       TIME NEEDED TO SCAN THE PDS. AFTER ALL PDSES ARE PROCESSED 2
       ADDITIONAL MESSAGES ARE PRODUCED. THE FIRST SHOWS WHERE CXYPSCAN
       OBTAINED ITS INPUT, WHAT THE PRINT OPTION WAS, AND WHAT LOGIC
       WAS USED. THE SECOND SHOWS ALL MEMBER LIST OPTIONS IN EFFECT.
       FINALLY IF THERE WHERE ANY HITS IN ANY PDS SCANNED AND IF ARGTOTS
       OR AT WAS SPECIFIED A TABLE OF ARGUMENT HITS BY ARGUMENT NUMBER
       WILL BE PRINTED WITH OVERALL TOTALS PLUS TOTALS BY MEMBERS AND
       PDSES.
             2. THE //INDEX DD CARD CONTAINS A LIST OF MEMBERS WITH HITS
       FOUND WITHIN EACH PDS SCANNED. IT IS AN INDEX INTO THE PAGES OF
       THE //SYSPRINT FILE AND CONTAINS COUNTS OF RECORDS, HITS, AND
       ARGUMENTS FOUND.
             3. THE //SYSPRINT DD CARD LISTS THE MEMBERS FOUND WITH
       HITS. ONLY RECORDS THAT HAVE HITS ARE LISTED AS A DEFAULT OR
       IF PARM='LISTHITS' OR 'LH' IS SPECIFIED ON THE EXEC CARD. ONE
       TO THREE LINES ARE REQUIRED PER RECORD DEPENDING ON LRECL. ALSO
       SHOWN ARE THE RELATIVE NUMBER OF THE RECORD, A COUNT OF HITS
       WITHIN THE LINE, THE LOCATION OF THE FIRST HIT WITHIN THE LINE,
       ARGUMENT NUMBER OF THE FIRST HIT WITHIN THE LINE, AND FOR
       VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS THE LENGTH OF THE RECORD.
             THERE IS ONE //MESSAGE LIST PER EXECUTION AND USUALLY ONE
       //INDEX AND ONE //SYSPRINT PAIR PER PDS IN WHICH HITS ARE FOUND.
       IF THE USER SPECIFIES PARM='NOLIST' ON THE EXEC CARD, THE
       //SYSPRINT CARD WILL NOT BE PRODUCED. THE //INDEX AND //SYSPRINT
       FORMATS ARE PATTERNED AFTER THE LISTPDS UTILITY AND THE -SCAN
       FUNCTION OF ADR/LIBRARIAN.


************************************************************************
*                   EXECUTION TIME PARMS.                              *
************************************************************************
              THERE ARE SEVERAL VALID PARAMETERS FOR CXYPSCAN THOUGH
       NO PARMS ARE REQUIRED. THE PARMS ARE ALL KEYWORD, ARE SEPERATED
       BY COMMAS AND MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY ORDER.
              1. AND. 'AND' LOGIC WILL BE IN EFFECT (I.E. FOR A MEMBER
              TO BE CONSIDERED TO BE FOUND ALL ARGUMENTS EXCEPT THOSE
              EXCLUDED MUST BE FOUND WITHIN THE MEMBER). IF AND IS
              SPECIFIED AND ONLY ONE ARGUMENT IS ENTERED CXYPSCAN WILL
              SWITCH THE LOGIC TO 'OR' INTERNALLY.
              2. RECORD OR REC. 'RECORD' LOGIC WILL BE IN EFFECT (I.E.
              FOR A MEMBER TO BE CONSIDERED TO BE FOUND ALL ARGUMENTS
              EXCEPT THOSE EXCLUDED MUST BE FOUND WITHIN ONE OR MORE
              LOGICAL RECORDS WITHIN THE MEMBER). IF RECORD IS
              SPECIFIED AND ONLY ONE ARGUMENT IS ENTERED CXYPSCAN WILL
              SWITCH THE LOGIC TO 'OR' INTERNALLY.
              3. LISTHITS OR LH. LIST ONLY THOSE RECORDS IN WHICH HITS
              ARE FOUND. THIS IS NOW THE DEFAULT BUT THE PARM IS RETAINED
              TO MAINTAIN COMPATABILITY WITH OLD JOBS.
              4. LISTALL OR LA. LIST ALL RECORDS IN THE FOUND MEMBER.
              LISTALL WILL OVERRIDE LISTHITS(LH) IF BOTH ARE SPECIFIED.
              THIS WAS THE LIST DEFAULT BUT WAS CHANGED BECAUSE THE VAST
              MAJORITY OF RUNS USED LISTHIST. THUS THIS PARM WAS ADDED
              AND LISTHITS WAS RETAINED TO MINIMIZE CHANGES.
              5. NOLIST OR NL. NO //SYSPRINT LIST OF THE FOUND MEMBERS
              WILL BE PRODUCED AND ASTERICS WILL BE PLACED INTO THOSE
              AREAS IN THE //MESSAGE AND //INDEX LISTINGS THAT PERTAIN
              TO THE //SYSPRINT LISTING. THIS WILL OVERRIDE LISTHITS(LH)
              AND/OR LISTALL(LA) IF MULTIPLE PARMS ARE ENTERED.
              6. PATTERNS OR PATS. ANY CHARACTER IN THE SEARCH ARGUMENT
              EXCEPT THE FIRST THAT HAS EITHER +, !, @,OR # WILL
              INDICATE A WILDCARD SEARCH OF THE INPUT DATA ACCORDING
              TO THE FOLLOWING RULES:
                    A. IF THE WILDCARD PATTERN IS +(PLUS) ANY CHARACTER
                       IN THE INPUT DATA WILL BE CONSIDERED EQUAL TO
                       THE PATTERN CHARACTER.
                    B. IF THE WILDCARD PATTERN IS ! (EXCLAMATION POINT)
                       ANY NUMERIC (0-9) IN THE INPUT DATA WILL BE
                       CONSIDERED EQUAL TO THE PATTERN CHARACTER.
                    C. IF THE WILDCARD PATTERN IS @ (AMPERSAND) ANY
                       ALPHABETIC (A-Z) IN THE INPUT DATA WILL BE
                       CONSIDERED EQUAL TO THE PATTERN CHARACTER.
                    D. IF THE WILDCARD PATTERN IS # (POUND SIGN) ANY
                       ALPHANUMERIC (0-9,A-Z) IN THE INPUT DATA WILL BE
                       CONSIDERED EQUAL TO THE PATTERN CHARACTER.
                       NOTE: ALTHOUGH THE PROGRAM DOES NOT "FOLD" UPPER
                       AND LOWER CASE ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS TOGETHER,
                       EITHER UPPER OR LOWER CASE LETTERS (A-Z) WILL
                       SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT FOR @ OR # WILDCARDING.
              7. CONSOLE. USED IN THE STARTED TASK MODE OF OPERATION.
              PROGRAM WILL PROMPT THE CONSOLE OPERATOR FOR ARGUMENTS
              TO BE SEARCHED FOR.
              8. ARGTOTS OR AT. A LIST OF ARGUMENTS BY ARGUMENT NUMBER
              WITH HIT COUNTS WILL BE PRODUCED.
              9. DISKADDR OR DA. THE DISK ADDRESS OF THE FOUND MEMBERS
              WILL BE PRINTED ON THE //INDEX FILE.
              10. ALIAS. NORMALLY CXYPSCAN WILL IGNORE ALIAS DIRECTORY
              ENTRIES ON THE THEORY THAT ONLY ONE COPY OF THE DATA
              ACTUALLY EXITS IN THE PDS. CODING PARM='ALIAS' WILL
              CAUSE ALIAS ENTRIES TO BE PROCESSED. CODING ALIAS AND
              DISKADDR AND FORCING A HIT ON A MEMBER BY ENTERING A
              KNOWN STRING OF CHARARCTERS WITHIN THE MEMBER WILL
              SHOW IF THE ALIASES ARE VALID.
              11. TRUNCATE OR TR. OFTEN ON VARIABLE LENTH PDSES
              OF CLISTS ETC A BLKSIZE OF FROM TO 256 TO 264 IS
              INDICATED IN THE VTOC BUT THE DATA CONTAINS VERY
              SHORT RECORDS. TRUNCATE ALLOWS CXYPSCAN TO PROCESS
              THE FIRST 255 BYTES OF THESE RECORD.

              AS A DEFAULT CXYPSCAN WILL SCAN ENTIRE PDSES. HOWEVER
       5 DIFFERENT MEMBER LIST PARAMETERS MAY BE ENTERED TO RESTRICT
       THE MEMBERS SCANNED. ONE OCCURANCE OF EACH OF THESE PARAMETERS
       MAY BE USED IN EACH EXECUTION. THE MEMBER LIST/S IN EFFECT WILL
       BE PRINTED AFTER THE OPTIONS IN EFFECT ON //MESSAGE.
              1. MEMFROM=XXXXXXXX ALL MEMBERS ARE PROCESSED FROM THE
              ONE INDICATED TO END OF FILE OR THROUGH THE MEMBER
              INDICATED ON A FROMTO PARM. XXXXXXXX MUST BE 8 BYTES
              PADDED WITH BLANKS IF NECESSARY.
              2. MEMTO=XXXXXXXX ALL MEMBERS ARE PROCESSED THROUGH THE
              ONE INDICATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FILE OR FROM
              THE ONE INDICATED ON A MEMFROM PARM. XXXXXXXX MUST BE 8
              BYTES PADDED WITH BLANKS IF NECESSARY.
              3. MEMRANGE=X:Y. MEMBERS BEGINNING WITH CHARACTER
              INDICATED BY X THROUGH THOSE INDICATED BY Y WILL BE
              PROCESSED. X MUST BE GREATER THAN Y OR A PARAMETER ERROR
              WILL BE INDICATED. TO GET ONLY MEMBER BEGINNING WITH A
              CHARACTER USE MEMPATTERN=X+++++++.
              4. MEMPATTERN=XX++XX++. MEMBERS ARE PROCESSED IF THEY
              CONTAIN THE CHARACTERS INDICATED IN THE PATTERN. ALL +
              POSITIONS ARE WILDCARDED. THE PATTERN MUST BE 8 BYTES
              PADDED WITH BLANKS IF NECESSARY.
              5. MEMSTRING=X1,,,XN. THE MEMBER WILL BE PROCESSES IF
              THE CHARACTERS IN THE STRING APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE
              MEMBER NAME. THE STRING MAY BE FROM 1 TO 8 CHARACTERS
              IN LENGTH.

************************************************************************
              THERE ARE EIGHT POSSIBLE RETURN CODES FOR ANY EXECUTION
       OF CXYPSCAN.
              1. 00 HITS ON ALL SCANNED FILES.
              2. 04 NO HITS ON SOME OR ALL FILES.
              3. 08 INVALID FILE SPECIFIED.
                    A. DATA SET NOT ON VOLUME.
                    B. DATA SET ORG NOT PS OR PO.
                    C. RECFM NOT F/FB OR V/VB.
                    D. LRECL NOT 50-255.
                    E. BLKSIZE NOT MULTIPLE OF LRECL FOR F/FB.
                    F. SPANNED RECORDS FOR V/VB.
              4. 0C NO VALID ARGUMENTS ENTERED.

              7. 18 INVALID PARAMETER/S ENTERED.
              8. 1C ALL ARGUMENTS EXCLUDED.

              THE PROGRAM WILL RETURN THE HIGHEST RETURN CODE FOR A PDS
       AS THE RETURN CODE FOR THE RUN. ERROR CODES 0C THROUGH 1C WILL
       RESULT IN AN ERROR MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT SHOWN ABOVE AND NO PDS
       BEING SCANNED.


************************************************************************
*                   USER ABEND CODES.                                  *
************************************************************************
              THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE USER ABEND CODES FOR ANY EXECUTION
       OF CXYPSCAN.
              1. ABEND U001. FIND MACRO FAILED FOR A MEMBER NAME THAT
                 APPEARS IN THE DIRECTORY OF A PDS BEING PROCESSED.
                 THIS IS CAUSED BY A DISK I/O ERROR OR A CLOBBERED
                 PDS.
              2. ABEND U002. WRONG LENGTH RECORD ENCOUNTERED WHEN
                 PROCESSING A MEMBER OF A PDS. FOR FIXED LENGTH RECORD
                 FILES THIS IS USUALLY CAUSED BY THE ACTUAL DATA ON
                 THE DISK BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE LRECL/BLKSIZE
                 ACTUALLY IN THE F1 DSCB. FOR VARIABLE LENGTH FILES
                 IT INDICATES A BAD RDW IN THE FILE.

              WHEN EITHER OF THESE CONDITIONS OCCUR THE JOB IS ABENDED
       AND NO MORE PDSES ARE PROCESSED.


************************************************************************
*                   CONTROL CARDS.                                     *
************************************************************************
              THE USER MUST SPECIFY BY CONTROL STATEMENT THE ARGUMENTS
       TO BE SEARCHED FOR. THE FIRST FOUR POSITIONS SPECIFY IN HEX THE
       RECORD POSITIONS TO WHICH THE SEARCH IS LIMITED. TYPICALLY YOU
       CODE 0100 WHICH TELLS CXYPSCAN TO START IN POSITION 1 AND SCAN
       TO THE END OF RECORD. CODING 0000 IS SYNONYMOUS WITH 0100. IF
       YOU DO WANT TO RESTRICT THE SEARCH TO CERTAIN COLUMNS ENTER THE
       BEGINNING LOCATION IN COLUMNS 1+2 (IN HEX) AND THE LENGTH OF
       THE FIELD IN COLUMNS 3+4 (IN HEX). AN EXAMPLE OF THIS MIGHT BE
       0A200**PGM=ICKDSF. HERE CHARACTER STRING PGM=ICKDSF IS SEARCHED
       FOR BETWEEN COLUMNS 10 AND 41. COLUMN 5 MAY HAVE 2 VALID ENTRIES
       OTHER THAN ZERO. AN E IN COLUMN 5 WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH
       PARM='AND', 'RECORD', OR 'REC' ON THE EXEC CARD CAUSES THIS
       ARGUMENT TO BE USED AS AN EXCLUSION. THAT IS IF THE STRING IS
       FOUND THE MEMBER OR RECORD WILL BE CONSIDERED NOT FOUND. THERE
       MAY BE MANY EXCLUDES IN ONE RUN BUT AT LEAST ONE NON EXCLUDED
       ARGUMENT MUST EXIST.
       A P IN COLUMN 5 CAUSES A SEARCH OF THE ARGUMMENT FOR A +, !, @
       OR # AND A WILDCARD SEARCH FOR THESE COLUMNS IN ACCORDANCE WITH
       THE RULES SHOWN ABOVE UNDER THE PATTERN PARAMETER.
       THE FIRST CHARACTER OF THE ARGUMENT CANNOT BE PATTERN.
       TO EXCLUDE A PATTERN ARGUMENT CODE E IN COLUMN 5 OF THE CONTROL
       STATEMENT AND PARM='PATTERNS' OR 'PATS' ON THE EXECUTE CARD.
       COLUMNS 6+7 OF THE CONTROL STATEMENT CONTAINS THE LENGTH OF THE
       ARGUMENT/S BEING SEARCHED FOR. WHEN ** IS ENTERED IN THIS
       FIELD THE LENGTH OF THE ARGUMENT IS CALCULATED AS STARTING IN
       COLUMN 8 AND EXTENDING TO THE LAST NON-BLANK CHARACTER AT OR
       BEFORE COLUMN 71. THUS THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF AN ARGUMENT USING
       ** IN COLS 6+7 IS 64 BYTES. TO SEARCH FOR ARGUMENTS EXTENDING TO
       COLUMN 80 OR FOR ONES ENDING IN BLANK/S YOU MUST CODE A LENGTH
       FIELD IN DECIMAL IN COLS 6+7. THE MAXIMUM LENGTH THAT CAN BE
       ENTERED IS THUS 73. IN ALL CASES THE MINIMUM LENGTH IS 01. ANY
       STRING OF EBCDIC CHARACTERS  MAY BE ENTERED AS A SEARCH
       ARGUMENT EXCEPT ONE OF ALL BLANKS. WHEN AN INVALID CONTROL
       STATEMENT IS ENCOUNTERED BY CXYPSCAN THE FOLLOWING ERROR
       MESSAGE IS SENT TO //MESSAGE:
       INVALID ARGUMENT RC=(XX) ENT WAS (THE CONTROL STATEMENT).
       THE POSSIBLE VALUES FOR XX AND THEIR MEANINGS ARE:
              1. 01 COLUMNS 1-4 CONTAIN OTHER THAN VALID HEX
                 CHARACTERS (0-9,A-F).

                 EXCEEDS 255 (I.E. 02FF0**ABCDE). THIS IS ASKING TO
                 SEARCH FOR STRING ABCDE STARTING IN POSITION 2 OF
                 THE RECORD THROUGH THE NEXT 255 POSITIONS. THIS
                 IS INVALID BECAUSE THE SEARCH LIMIT GOES BEYOND THE
                 MAXIMUM LRECL SUPPORTED BY CXYPSCAN.
              3. 03 THE ARGUMENT ENTERED IS LONGER THAN THE SEARCH
                 LIMIT SPECIFIED (I.E. 01040**ABCDE). THIS IS AN
                 ATTEMPT TO SEARCH FOR STRING ABCDE (5 CHARACTERS) IN
                 LOCATIONS 1-4 (4 POSITIONS).
              4. 04 EXCLUDE INVALID IN 'OR' PROCESSING. EXCLUDE ENTRIES
                 MAY ONLY BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PARM='AND',

              5. 05 INVALID ENTRY IN COLUMN 5 (NOT 0,E,P).
              6. 06 ARGUMENT CONTAINS ALL BLANKS.

       TO RUN CXYPSCAN IN TSO FOREGROUND MODE THE USER WILL RUN THE
       PSCAN CLIST SHOWN ABOVE. AS SHOWN ON THE PROC STATEMENT ONLY
       ONE OPTION IS POSITIONAL AND IT IS REQUIRED. IF NO OPTIONS
       ARE SPECIFIED WITH THE PSCAN ENTRY TSO WILL PROMPT THE USER
       FOR THE DSNAME OF THE PDS TO BE SCANNED. THE PROGRAM WILL THEN
       PROMPT THE TERMINAL USER FOR THE ARGUMENTS TO BE SCANNED FOR.
       TO END THIS ENTRY PHASE THE TERMINAL USER TYPES IN A /* IN
       COLUMNS 1-2 AND BLANKS THE REST OF THE FIELD. THIS ENDS THE
       ENTRY PHASE AND STARTS THE PROCESSING OF THE PDS. OPTIONALLY
       THE PARM AND LIST OPTION KEYWORDS MAY BE ENTERED WITH THE PSCAN
       COMMAND. PARM REFERS TO THE PARAMETERS DESIRED ON THE RUN AND
       WILL BE ENTERED WHEN OTHER THAN THE DEFAULT PARMS ARE REQUIRED.
       IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENED THAT THE LIST OPTION ALWAYS BE BE USED.
       IT'S FORM MUST BE LIST(DS(*)). THE USE OF THE LIST OPTION CAUSES
       THE ARGUMENT ENTRIES TO BE ECHOED BACK TO THE TERMAINAL USER AS
       HE ENTERS THEM. THUS ERRORS CAN BE SEEN IMMEDIATELY AND
       CORRECTED ACCORDING TO THE RETURN CODES SHOWN ABOVE. ONCE THE
       PDS PROCESSING BEGINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE PDS BEING SCANNED
       IS SENT TO THE TERMINAL USER, AND AS HITS ARE MADE THE INDEX
       ENTRIES ARE SHOWN AT THE TERMINAL. WHEN PROCESSING ENDS ALL OTHER
       OUTPUT ASSOCIATED WITH THE //MESSAGE DD CARD IS SENT TO THE
       TERMINAL. THE USER CAN THEN USE ISPF 3.8 OR THE SERVICES OF A
       JES2 SPOOL PRODUCT SUCH AS SDSF OR IOF TO REVIEW THE HELD OUTPUT
       OF THE //SYSPRINT FILE. A TYPICAL PSCAN ENTRY WOULD BE:
       PSCAN QTB2FDJ.JCL.CNTL PARM('AND,LH') LIST(DS(*))

       TO EXEC CXYPSCAN FROM THE MVS MASTER CONSOLE THE OPERATOR STARTS
       THE PDSSCAN PROC SHOWN ABOVE. ON THE START COMMAND HE WILL
       ENTER THE PDS TO BE SCANNED (UNLESS IT IS THE DEFAULT) AND THE
       PARAMETERS TO BE USED IN THIS EXECUTION. THE ALPHA CHARACTERS
       ENTERED UNDER PDS= AND PARMS= MUST BE IN UPPER CASE DUE TO MVS
       CONVENTIONS. A TYPICAL OPERATOR ENTRY WOULD BE:
       S PDSSCAN,PDS='DDTFDJ.JCL.CNTL',PARMS=',AND,LISTHITS'
       NOTE THE , AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PARMS. THIS IS USED TO APPEND
       THE ENTERED PARMS TO THE CONSOLE PARAMETER SPECIFIED IN THE
       PROC. AT THIS TIME CXYPSCAN WILL PRESENT THE FOLLOWING WTOR
       TO THE MASTER CONSOLE OPERATOR:
       XX CXYPSCAN ENTER ARGUMENT 001; ENTER /* OR HIT EOB TO PROCESS
       THE OPERATOR WILL ENTER XX(SYSTEM WTOR ID) IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED
       BY AN ARGUMENT. IF THE ARGUMENT IS VALID THE WTOR WILL BE
       REPEATED WITH THE ARGUMENT NUMBER INCREMENTED BY 1. IF ANY
       ARGUMENT IS ERRONEOUSLY ENTERED THE WTOR WILL REPEAT THE LAST
       ARGUMENT NUMBER. WHEN ALL ARGUMENTS ARE ENTERED THE ENTRY PHASE
       CAN BE TERMINATED AND THE PDS PROCESSING PHASE BEGUN BY EITHER
       ENTERING A /* OR HITTING EOB IN RESPONSE TO THE LAST WTOR.
       IN CONSOLE MODE ALL PRINTED OUTPUT GOES TO SYSOUT DATA SETS AS
       PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED. AT THE END OF THE RUN A WTO IS ISSUED
       SHOWING THE RETURN CODE FOR THE RUN. THIS ALLOWS THE CONSOLE
       OPERATOR TO KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY HITS BEFORE HE CONSULTS
       THE PRINTOUT.
