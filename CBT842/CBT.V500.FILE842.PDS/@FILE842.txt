//***FILE 842 is from Roger Mihay and contains a way to put a       *   FILE 842
//*           large number of pds'es or sequential files into TSO   *   FILE 842
//*           XMIT format and download them to a PC for viewing     *   FILE 842
//*           with XMIT manager or some similar tool on the PC.     *   FILE 842
//*                                                                 *   FILE 842
//*           The bulk processing of the pds'es or sequential       *   FILE 842
//*           files is done via giving them a similar dataset       *   FILE 842
//*           prefix.  Or if the datasets already had the same      *   FILE 842
//*           prefix, you can unload them together.                 *   FILE 842

//*     Attached is an updated version of file 842.  I have         *   FILE 842
//*     added the capacity to edit (in ISPF) the selection list     *   FILE 842
//*     to remove any datasets that one may not want to be          *   FILE 842
//*     processed.                                                  *   FILE 842
