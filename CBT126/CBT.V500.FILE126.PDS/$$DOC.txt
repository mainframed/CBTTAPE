 Installation consists of submitting jobs in members starting with
 an @, updating JES2PARMS and adding an SVC.
 The JCL in the jobs will have to be updated. The name of the source
 library needs to be changed to the name of this library and the
 object library will either have to be changed to a temp or
 an object lib will have to be set up.
 *WARNING* These jobs are set up to go against system libraries
           You may want to set them up to go against test copies.
 Member JES2PARM contains JES2 parms to be added to your JES2 parms
 Member IEASVC00 contains the entry for IEASVC00 for the SVC.
 If you want to change the SVC number make sure to change the
 SVC 252 line in IEAVMXIT.

  Input to IEEC3PO

  IEEC3PO builds a table in CSA that IEAVMXIT uses to do replies.

  The input consists of the characters /* in columns 1 and
  2, the word PASSWORD in columns 3-10, a password beginning in column
  12 followed by at least one blank and an optional keyword parameter
  DSN.
  Columns 72-80 are ignored.

     _______________________________________________________________
   /           _                 _  _             _  _          _
   |ID=(msgid)|,CMD=('cmd')       ||,ROUTCDE=(rcde)||,DESC=(dcde)|
              |     ('R XX,reply')||              _  _          _
+              _                 _  _

  ID=(msgid)
      msgid is id of message to be acted on.

  CMD=('cmd')
     cmd must be in quotes. It is the command to be issued if message
     msgid is issued
  CMD=('R XX,reply')
     R XX,reply must be in quotes
     The R XX, shows this to be a reply to a WTOR instead of a command
     reply is the the reply to be issued
  ROUTCDE=(rcde)
     rcde is the route codes this message is to be set to
  DESC=(dcde)
     dcde is the descriptor codes this message is to be set to

  Examples.

  ID=(IKT005I),CMD=('S CNM04'),CMD=('S RSCSLINK')
  ID=(IKT012D),CMD=('R XX,U')
  ID=(DFH0606),ROUTCDE=(1),DESC=(11)         /* MAKE IT NON-DELETABLE */

  The PASSWORD Statement


  Control Statement

          The PASSWORD statement permits you to specify passwords
          for VSAM and NON-VSAM datasets.


  The PASSWORD statement consists of the characters /* in columns 1 and
  2, the word PASSWORD in columns 3-10, a password beginning in column
  12 followed by at least one blank and an optional keyword parameter
  DSN.
  Columns 72-80 are ignored.

     __________________________________________
   /                     _       _
   |/*PASSWORD password |parameter|
+                        _       _

  The following parameter may be coded.
   _               _
  |DSN=data set name|
+  _               _


  password
    the password (1 to 8 characters) for specified dataset

  DSN=data set name
    The data set name (1 to 44 characters) for which password is to be
    used.

  Rules for coding
    * If DSN= keyword parameter is not specified on a PASSWORD statement
      the password on that statement will be used as the default
      password
    * If more than one PASSWORD statement has the same data set name
      (or no data set name) the last PASSWORD statement specifying the
      data set name is used.
    * Place the PASSWORD statement after the job statement.


  Example of the PASSWORD statement
    /*PASSWORD WTFGASAW DSN=MY.DSN
   The password WTFGASAW will be used for the data set MY.DSN
