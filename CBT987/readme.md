//***FILE 987 is from Sam Golob and contains a few utilities        *   FILE 987
//*           which were rescued from the NaSPA VIP utilities tape  *   FILE 987
//*           of "old" (around 1990 or before).  They either didn't *   FILE 987
//*           work at all, or they didn't work well, under z/OS.    *   FILE 987
//*           Now (at least) they work.                             *   FILE 987
//*                                                                 *   FILE 987
//*           Of course:  Thanks to Scott Sherer, president of      *   FILE 987

//*       WAITT    - A utility to adjust the timeout time on your   *   FILE 987
//*                  TSO session, or make it not time out at all.   *   FILE 987
