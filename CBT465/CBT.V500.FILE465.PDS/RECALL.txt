Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          One of the largest complaints users have about the ISPF
          Command Line is that it does not allow a user to "RECALL" the
          last command. If a user types in a long TSO command or a FIND
          command in Edit, there currently is no way to recall that
          command back to the command line so that a user may optionally
          modify the command and reissue it.

          Below you will find code you may add to the Edit panels which
          will allow users to recall the last Edit command entered. This
          includes Find, Change etc. as well as installation Edit
          Macros. It does not include commands prefaced by TSO or any
          other Command Table command.

          Once the code below has been added, all the user does is type
          a question mark (?) on the Edit Command Line and the last edit
          command entered will be placed on the command line.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        ISPF, as delivered uses panel ISREDDE for edit and also has
          panel ISREFR01. The second panel is user modifiable per the
          ISPF Installation and Customization Panel. You should make the
          following changes to both panels. If your users have created
          their own edit panel, they too should be modified.

          To the above panels do the following:

          Add to the and of the REINIT section:

          )REINIT
           IF (&EDITSW ¬= &Z)
               .CURSOR = ZCMD
               .CSRPOS = 1
               &EDITSW = &Z

          Add to the and of the PROC   section:

          )PROC
           IF (.RESP = ENTER)
               IF (&ZCMD = '?')
                   &ZCMD = &EDITZCMD
                   REFRESH (ZCMD)
                   &ZEDSMSG = 'RECALL COMPLETED'
                   &ZEDLMSG = 'BY ENTERING A "?" YOU HAVE +
                   RECALLED YOUR LAST EDIT COMMAND'
                   &EDITSW = ON
                   .MSG = ISRZ000
               IF (&ZCMD ¬= '?',&Z)
                   &EDITZCMD = &ZCMD
                   VPUT (EDITZCMD) PROFILE
