Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is not a dialog but code you can use in your developing
          of an ISPF dialog.

          To write a user-friendly dialog, all dsnames entered by the
          user should be entered using TSO-dsname syntax. This means if
          the dsname is not enclosed in quotes the users TSO prefix
          should be added. If the dataset is enclosed in quotes, it
          should remain untouched. Also, the quotes should be stripped
          off.

          The following code may be embedded in a panel to convert a TSO
          dsname to JCL syntax. This is useful when file tailoring a
          dsname for JCL. You may want to create an Edit Model with this
          code.

Panel Code for PROC sections -------------------------------------------

          The following code must be modified as follows:

          1)  The string TSODSN should be modified to the variable name
              containing the dsname in TSO syntax.

          1)  The string JCLDSN should be modified to the variable name
              containing the dsname in JCL syntax.


 VER (&TSODSN,DSNAME)
 IF (&TSODSN ¬= &Z)
     IF (.MSG = &Z)
         &TEMP = TRUNC (&TSODSN,'''')
         &TRAIL = .TRAIL
         IF (&TRAIL = &Z)
             &JCLDSN = '&ZPREFIX..&TSODSN'
         IF (&TRAIL ¬= &Z)
             &JCLDSN = TRUNC (&TRAIL,'''')


The edit macro TSOTOJCL on this tape as of 8506 is designed to insert
the above code with a minimum amount of work. See the Edit Macro for
more.
