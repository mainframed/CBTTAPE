)F REXX function - VSAM db bulk access

Current build: 026

Fixed in this version
 Possible filter (MASK parameter) error

New in this version
 none

Changes in this version
 none

The program can add, replace, retrieve or delete records from a VSAM
database. Access is normally by key/keyprefix, but some functions allow
access based on text anywhere in the record. Data is either read from a
REXX stem or stack, or written to a REXX stem or stack.

VSAM types KSDS and fixed-length RRDS are supported.

Initial load of both types is supported.

RXVSAMBA is  reentrant and refreshable,  so can reside in  the LPAlib.

RXVSAMBA must be called as a function !

RXVSAMBA sets the following variables:
 RXVBVERS  version info
 RXVBREAD  number of reads
 RXVBWRIT  total number of writes (updates+inserts)
 RXVBINSE  number of inserts
 RXVBUPDT  number of updates
 RXVBDELE  number of deletes
 RXVBKEYL  key length from the ACB
 RXVBKEYP  key position from the ACB
 RXVBRECL  data base lrecl
 RXVBDBTY  data base type K=KSDS, R=RRDS
 RXVBERRM  error message

The program returns a return value

   0    all ok
  >0    some error, check the RXVBERRM value

** warning **
Build 015   Redefines the use  of operands LIST(name) and
            KEYSTEM(name).
            Changes the FILTER(name) operand to TEXTSTEM(name).
            Redefines the use for  the RXVBWRIT variable


Syntax

  rc=RXVSAMBA(action required-parameters other-parameters)

Required parameters - must be used in all calls

  DD(ddname)               Refers to the database
  or
  DA(datasetname)          Name of the database, it will be allocated
                           dynamically and freed.

Read database records

  GET    STEM(stemname)    Copy records to stem 'stemname'.
         STACK             Copy records to the stack.
                           Either STEM or STACK is required, they are
                           mutually exclusive.
         KEY(key-value)    KSDS: select by specific key, note that
                           leading and trailing blanks are stripped.
                           RRDS: record number, leading zeros are added
                           internally.
         KEYVAR(var-name)  Name of variable containing key, including
                           leading or trailing blanks.
         KEYSTEM(stemname) Select by keys in stem.
         MASK(mask)        Scan the entire database, select by mask.
                           Mask wildcards are '%' for one character and
                           '*' for any number, incl no, characters.
         TEXT(text) POS(start) ÝENDPOS(end)¨
         TEXTSTEM(stemname) POS(start) ÝENDPOS(end)¨
                           Scan the entire database, select by value 'text'
                           or text in stem 'stemname'
         TO(to-val)        RRDS only, ending record number to retrieve.

         KEY and MASK may be used together, thereby significantly reducing
         wild-card search time. I.e. 'KEY(M) MASK(M*NTH*)' will often be
         much faster than just 'MASK(M*NTH*)'

Get data by key to stem, delete retrieved records.

  PULL   operands

  Same operand syntax as for the GET command.

Delete database records.

  DELETE KEY(key-value)    Select by specific key.
         KEYVAR(var-name)  Name of variable containing key, including
                           leading or trailing blanks.
         KEYSTEM(stemname) Select by keys in stem.
         MASK(mask) POS(start) ÝENDPOS(end)¨
         MASKSTEM(stemname) POS(start) ÝENDPOS(end)¨
         TEXT(text) POS(start) ÝENDPOS(end)¨
         TEXTSTEM(stemname) POS(start) ÝENDPOS(end)¨
                           Scan the entire database, select by value 'text'
                           or text in stem 'stemname'
         LIST(stemname)    Copy deleted records to list.

         KEY  and  MASK  may  be  used  together,  thereby  significantly
         reducing wild-card search time.  I.e. 'KEY(M) MASK(M*NTH*)' will
         often be much faster than just 'MASK(M*NTH*)'

Insert records  - records must  be sorted in ascending  order and
must be new.

  INSERT STEM(stemname)    Insert records from stem 'stemname'.
         STACK             Insert records from the stack.
                           Either STEM or STACK is required, they are
                           mutually exclusive.

Add records  - records  need not be  sorted, exising  records are
updated.

  PUT    STEM(stemname)    Add records from stem 'stemname'.
         STACK             Add records from the stack.
                           Either STEM or STACK is required, they are
                           mutually exclusive.

         VALUE(text)       'text' is the data to add, max length 120 bytes.
                           If output is to a RRDS then value must start
                           with an 8-byte record number.

         RXVBDBTY  data base type K=KSDS, R=RRDS

         Sets the following variable
         RXVBVERS


Notes to syntax

 Stemname must have a dot '.' at the end.
 Key-value can be a key prefix.
 Key-value and value are case sensitive.
 KEY specification. The KEY operand is stripped by leading and trailing
 blanks. This maens that if you specify a key with a length shorter
 than the database reclen, then an additional READ is done, due to the
 key-sequential processing done for keyed request. This can be avoided
 by one of these means:
  Use the KEYVAR or KETSTEM operand, values there are not stripped.
  Pad the KEY value to the db reclen and add a non-blank at the end. The
  KEY value is truncated to the DB reclen internally.


Samples

RRDS Support

 The program now supports fixed-length RRDS databases. All the GET and
 PUT features are available, plus the GET .. TO (to-val) option. DELETE
 and thus PULL are not supported for RRDS as you cannot delete records in
 a RRDS, only replace. INSERT works as an alias for PUT, so you really
 should use just the PUT command.

 Records have the following format:
   1-8  record number
   9-   data
 This format must be also used when adding data.

 Even though data is stored as fixed length, they need not be filled to
 the lrecl when added, as records are padded with blanks when stored and
 stripped for trailing blanks when retrieved.

 Records can be written in any order.

 Sample read, get slots 6-8 to list
   cc=RxVsamBa('get dd(rrds) stem(lst.) key(6) to(8)')

 Sample read, get slots 8, 6, 4 and 2 to list

   parse value '4 8 6 4 2' with ks.0 ks.1 ks.2 ks.3 ks.4
   cc=RxVsamBa('get dd(rrds) stem(lst.) keystem(ks.)')

 Sample write, (re) write slots 11, 13 and 15:

   new.1= '00000011RXVSAMBA supports'
   new.2= '00000013VSAM fixed-length RRDS databases'
   new.3= '00000015as of build 022'
   new.0= 3
   cc=RXVSAMBA('put dd(rrds) stem(new.)')
