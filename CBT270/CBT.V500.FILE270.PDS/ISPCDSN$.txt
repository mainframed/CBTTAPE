           - Extracts dsnames from updated screen image to allow
             message fields to processed.
           - Extracts member names or dataset names withing a set
             of parentheses.
           - Allows cursor positioning on beginning and ending
             quotes and parentheses.


     Ispcdsn will extract a dataset, pointed to by the cursor,
     from an ISPF display panel.  Dataset names are scanned for
     following standard naming and length conventions.

     The variable name to contain the dataset name must be passed
     to the program as a parameter, and will be placed into the
     SHARED variable pool if no errors are encountered.  If errors
     are encountered, a return code reflecting the type of error
     will be returned following completion of the program.

     Return Codes:
       (4)  - Dataset name contains unmatched quotes
       (8)  - Dataset name missing between quotes
       (12) - Cursor not on a dataset name
       (16) - Dataset name larger than the 56 byte maximum
       (20) - Control Block parameter error

     Example:
       ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(ISPCDSN) PARM(SOMEVAR)
       IF &LASTCC = 0 THEN +
         ISPEXEC VGET (SOMEVAR) SHARED




                  --V2R1 EXAMPLES--    ( | = CURSOR IN EXAMPLES)
  Here's an example of the updated screen image enhancement.  Prior
  to V2R1, trying to extract this VIO dsn following a compress
  would result in a null line.  Now; however, the VIO dataset
  displayed when help is entered can be browsed to view the output
  FROM THE COMPRESS OPERATION.

  Here's an example of the dsname within parentheses enhancement:

   ALLOC F(CDSN) DSN(MY.LOAD)
                        |

     Now returns "MY.LOAD" instead of "DSN(MY.LOAD)" which would
     result in an "INVALID DATASET NAME" when processed, as in
     the previous release.

     A dataset name and member may be extracted as before if cursor
     is placed on the dsname part:

   SRC.ASM(ISPCDSN)
                 |


   Cursor may be positioned on beginning or ending quotes:

   'GS00155.SRC.ASM(ISPCDSN)'
   |
            OR
   'GS00155.SRC.ASM(ISPCDSN)'
                            |
       however, the first would return the dsn and member and
       the second would return just the member.
