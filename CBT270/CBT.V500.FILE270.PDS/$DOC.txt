************************************************************************
* DIS   Mods Tape - Version 8.0            ------------  Date 10/17/89
************************************************************************
*
*     The purpose of this tape is to transfer some of DIS's local
*   utilities. All this stuff works here, but we don't guarantee it
*   to work anywhere else. Some programs may need modification for
*   an installation. Some are good only as "HOWTO" samples.
*
*     This tape contains the DIS programs which were released in
*   CBT files 270-274. Two of those programs, named FTL and KOMM, have
*   been modified and the latest versions are on this tape.
*
*     Many of the TSO commands use the SETVAR subroutine.
*   You may need to assemble SETVAR before these commands will work.
*
*     If a utility has documentation which is maintained separately,
*   the document may be in the source PDS with a similiar name ending
*   with the "$" character. A separate library for documents has
*   been added containing many documents from the DOCSYS system- it
*   is unloaded to member DOCLIB in this dataset.
*
*     If a utility has a sample JCL stream maintained separately,
*   the JCL is in the source PDS with a similiar name but ending
*   with the "#" character.
*
************************************************************************
******** Tape loading information :     ********************************
************************************************************************
*
* The tape is 1600 BPI NON-LABELED, with two files which are IEBCOPY
* unloaded partitioned datasets.
*         FILE ONE   - SOURCE CODE FOR OUR MODS.   (11 CYLS ON A 3380)
*         FILE TWO   - LOAD Library for convenience (2 CYLs ON A 3380)
*
* To create the necessary MACLIB, CLIST, PROCLIB, etc libraries after
* loading the source library from this tape:
*
*      Modify and submit either member REDIST or REDISTI which are in
*      this library.  (Use REDIST if program PDSLOAD from the CBT tape
*      is available, else use job REDISTI.)  REDIST or REDISTI will
*      create the MACLIB, CLIST, PROCLIB, PANELS, SKELS, MESSAGES, TEXT,
*      and PARM libraries from the appropriate members in this library.
*      (Note: I have included PDSLOAD in the LOAD library on file 2
*             of the tape in case you did not get it off the CBT tape.)
*
******** NOTE: CLISTs should be copied to a VB dataset after reloading.
*             (Some have numbers in cols 1-8 and lines > 80 chars long.)
*
******** NOTE: The INDEXES library must be copied to a dataset with an
*             LRECL of 200 before the DOCSYS system will work.
*
* Job MERGEJCL was used to unload libs into this one. Job EXPORT does
* IEBCOPY unload of source and load libs onto a tape. IMPORT loads them.

*
*  ALLOCGDG   PROGRAM   Dynamically allocate a GDG dataset to a DDNAME
*                       based on relative generation number (because
*                       TSO ALLOC will not do it!).
*
*  ALLOCMEM   PROGRAM   Dynamically allocate a partitioned dataset and
*                       its member  to  a  given DDNAME  from  a  high

*                       CATBYVO#. I think DYL260 step is not needed.
*
*  CHKBLOCK   Program   Batch program to scan JCL or PROCS and report
*                       on output datasets not efficiently blocked.
*                       Sample JCL in CHKBLOC# will scan a library.
*
*  CHKTODAY   Program   Batch program to check for existence and
*                       currency of a dataset. Sets a return code.
*                       We use so that only the first caller of our
*                       daily volume report process on any day does
*                       the extensive analysis of all volumes.
*
*  CLIB       CLIST     Allocate a private CLIST library for
*                       implicit CLIST execution without removing

*                       THE DIALOG. Now allows parm options for
*                       more complex requirements. The following
*                       sequence killed the screen overflow when
*                       exiting RESOLVE console mode to ISPF:
*                        ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(CLRSPFIO) PARM(OFF)
*                        ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(CLRSPFIO) PARM(INIT)
*                        ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(CLRSPFIO) PARM(NORM)

*
*  GETMY      TSO CMD   Sample command for returning user/system
*                       data to CLIST variables. Some installation
*                       sensitive code, but a good starting place!
*
*  HEXTRAN    PROGRAM   TRANSLATE DATA FROM CHARACTER CODED
*                       HEXADECIMAL TO TRUE HEXADECIMAL OR VICE

*  HOSEDOWN   CLIST     DEALLOCATE USER SPF DIALOG MANAGER
*                       LIBRARIES (UNDO WHAT A PREVIOUS FIREUP
*                       DID).
*
*  HOTKEYS    CLISTs    Sets PFKs to call HOTKEY clist as nested
*  HOTKEY               ISPF dialog. HOTKEY clist extracts dataset
*                       name (see ISPCDSN program) at cursor location
*                       and calls the requested application (PDS cmd,
*                       BROWSE, EDIT, etc.) passing the dataset name!
*                       Also supports ddnames and VIO dsnames.          .

*                       is cataloged. FILEINFO gives better data.
*
*  IKJUPDT    PROGRAM   Subroutine to convert calls to IKJUPDT
*                       into LINK to program SETVAR. We used to link IBM
*                       IKJUPDT (IKJCT433) directly with TSO commands in
*                       order to put data into CLIST variables. This
*                       technique is much more maintainable!.
*
*  INDEX      program   to scan a string for a delimiter and set
*                       a return code based on its location -
*                       used by HOTKEYS clist. Sets rc=0 if not found.
*
*  INMRZ01    PROGRAM   TSOE RECEIVE command exit. Interfaces with ACF2
*                       to control userid access and allow batch receive

*                       for your installation.
*
*  INTRDR     PROGRAM   THIS PROGRAM WILL ACCEPT A DDNAME PASSED TO IT
*                       IN THE PARAMETER LIST AND THEN DYNAMICALLY
*                       ALLOCATE THE INTERNAL READER TO THAT DDNAME
*
*  ISPCDSN    program   Fantastic program to extract a dataset name
*                       from the last displayed panel if the cursor was
*                       placed anywhere on a dataset name and put it in
*                       an ISPF variable! Please don't tell IBM about
*                       this one - it uses some internal ISPF pointers
*                       that we aren't supposed to know about!
*
*  ISPCMDS    TABLE     ISPF command table we use. Allows a dialog or
*                       panel to override commands, map PFKS, activate
*                       SCROLL keys, etc by just setting a function
*                       variable. Effect is local and does not screw up
*                       your split screens. Also has RTSO, OPT, BR, ED
*                       command support for nesting functions.
*
*  ISPF       misc      ISR@PRIM,KMENU,SPFBATU... Various ISPF stuff
*                       to show how we hook it all together here.
*                       Trace invisible option 'K' to find it.
*
*  ISPFmacs   CLISTs    CUT/PASTE, CENTER, SHOWFLOW, COM are ISPF edit
*                       macros. Some converted from IBM diskette for TSO
*                       Sorry, no docs available, but some HELP panels.
*                       (CUTHELP,PASTEHLP)

*                       A COBOL OR ASSEMBLER PROGRAM WAS
*                       COMPILED AND LINKED.
*
*  LISTMEMS   PROGRAM   Given the name of a  partitioned data set,
*                       produce an output file whose records  contain
*                       the names of the members of that PDS (one
*                       record per member).
*
*  LOADXREF   PROC      Cross  reference calling  programs to  called
*                       program and vice versa. (Uses SHIFT90, a 90
*                       degree print program. If you do not have this
*                       or IBM's ROTATE90, there is a public domain
*                       90 degree pgm in file 316, CBT mods tape).
*
*  LOCATE     TSO CMD   From the CBT tape originally. Modified to use
*                       LPALST00 as well as LNKLST00 on an XA system.
*                       Supports concatenated STEPLIBs also. Now has
*                       ISPLLIB support and does multi-members ok.
*
*  LOGKILLR   PROGRAM   An old program designed to kill TSO LOGON
*                       address spaces which hang in the user-prompt
*                       code due to user walking away, etc.
*
*  MEMSTAT    TSO CMD   Checks a PDS for a member and sets &LASTCC.
*                       Yeah, I know there are many, but WPPSS wants...
*
*  MLPALIST   PROGRAM   Lists modules loaded by MLPA or FLPA.
*                       Similiar to AMBLIST LISTLPA.
*
*  NEWISPF    PROGRAM   THIS MODULE IS THE FRONTEND FOR ISPF AND/OR PDF.
*                       IT HAS THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:
*                    1. SAVE THE INPUT ECT BECAUSE ISPF MODIFIES THE ECT
*                       PTR TO THE IOWA WHICH IS NEEDED BY THE
*                       WDPSCXS MODULE for stacking commands.
*                    2. ALLOCATE THE USER PROFILE LIB TO DDNAME ISPPROF.

*                       SUBCOMMAND MODE USING IKJSCAN (JUST LIKE
*                       PCF X FACILITY)
*
*  SERLCONV   PROGRAM   CONVERT SERIAL DATES TO STANDARD DATE
*                       FORMAT AFTER DATE VALIDATION.
*
*  SETRC      PROGRAM   This program turns a parm field into a
*                       condition code. It is used to control execution
*                       of PROC steps based on parms specified.
*                       Not as good as a new JCL language, but a start.
*
*  SETVAR     PROGRAM   This is a subroutine which a TSO command
*                       can link to in order to set a CLIST variable.
*                       It links in IKJCT433(IKJUPDT) from LPALIB
*                       for pre TSOE systems. For TSOE systems, the new
*                       IKJCT441 TSOE interface is used.
*
*  SHOW       TSO CMD   Replacement for JTIP SHOW ALL command. Requires
*                       JES2 exit-22, XJ22SHOW, and IGC00236 (included).
*
*  SPACE      TSO CMD   Displays allocation, utilization and extent
*                       info for a dataset. Can return data to a CLIST.
*
*  SMF64EXT   PROGRAM   Analyzes SMF type 64 records to identify VSAM
*                       datasets which are good candidates for use on
*                       cached disk volumes.
*
*  SMF74MOD   PROGRAM   Merges SMF type 74 records from multiple CPUs
*                       so ERBRMFPP device activity report will show
*                       all activity to shared devices. Works for XA
*                       and non-XA mixtures also.
*
*  SMPEIOF    PROGRAM   Intercepts SMPE calls to TSO STATUS command
*                       and reroutes them to STATUS CLIST (included)
*                       which uses IOF to check status and display
*                       SMPE jobs. Much better than TSO OUTPUT command.
*
*  SPFCATNV   CLIST     This is an ISPF dialog for doing NVSAM catalog
*                       functions. We use it as Tech Services option
*                       K.N here. Good if you have multiple master and
*                       user catalogs like we do. Change cat names in
*                       the CLIST.
*
*  PANLEXIT   PROGRAM   ISPF dialog interface to allow exits from ISPF
*                       display panels (not select panels yet) to a
*
*  SPFEXEC    PROGRAM   ISPF dialog interface to allow exits from ISPF
* (PANLEXIT)            display panels (not select panels) to a
*                       dialog or ISPF service. This is a replacement
*                       for PANLEXIT. It is one of our best mods!
*                       It allows fantastic flexibility in modifying
*                       vendor dialogs, etc. It also provides the
*                       interfaces to ISPLINK which IBM forgot! It can
*                       be called as a REAL TSO command in contrast to
*                       ISPEXEC which won't work from FOCUS, SAS, etc.
*                       It can also be called directly with a single
*                       ISPEXEC parm string in contrast to the two
*                       parms (length,string) ISPLINK requires. It
*                       accepts more flexible options than ISPEXEC
*                       and will even initialize ISPF if needed!!!
*                       Some SYNTAX examples:
*                            SPFEXEC SELECT PANEL(ISRUTIL)
*                       or   SPFEXEC PANEL(ISRUTIL)
*                            SPFEXEC 3.1
*                       or   @ SPFEXEC 'PANEL(ISRUTIL) OPT(1)'
*                       etc., etc., etc........
*
*
*  SPFPRINT   PROGRAM   This is linked as a frontend for your DSPRINT
*                       command. It picks up an ISPF variable and adds
*                       the contents to the command passed by ISPF. Now
*                       you can modify the DSPRINT commands issued by
*                       ISPF. Does not affect normal DSPRINT requests.

*                       to be renamed or scratched with no ENQ
*                       contention even if the dataset name is allocated
*                       to another job. It also allows a format one DSCB
*                       to be dumped or zapped without knowing the CCHHR
