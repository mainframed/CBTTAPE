  PROGRAM:       HEXTRAN
  AUTHOR:        Kermit Kiser
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Translate data from character coded hexadecimal to
                 true hexadecimal or vice-versa.

  RUN MODE:      Batch or interactive

  HEXTRAN is a subroutine which can be called by a COBOL program to
  translate  data   from  Character   coded  hexadecimal   to  true
  Hexadecimal or the reverse.  For  example the two characters 'C1'
  would translate to the one character  'A' (binary byte 1100 0001)
  or vice-versa.

  HEXTRAN can be called from a COBOL program as follows:

       CALL 'HEXTRAN' USING chararea, hexarea, charlen, type.

  chararea       -    area containing  or to contain  the character
                      coded hexadecimal.

  hexarea        -    area containing or to contain the hexadecimal
                      value.

  charlen        -    optional  binary  halfword giving  length  of
                      chararea (even number of  bytes).  Hexarea is
                      assumed  to be  half  the  size of  chararea.
                      Eight  (8) bytes  is  the  default length  of
                      chararea if charlen is not used.

  type      -    optional three character field with values 'HTC'
                      for hex to character translation or 'CTH' for
                      character to hex translation.
                      Character to Hex is the default if this parm is not specif

  NOTE:     HEXTRAN gives a return code of 4 if your parameters are
            invalid and a return code of 8 if it finds invalid data
            in chararea ('0123456789ABCDEF' are the only valid characters).
