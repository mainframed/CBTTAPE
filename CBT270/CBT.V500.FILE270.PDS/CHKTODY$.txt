           This program will search for a dataset, return a user code
           of 8 if it doesn't exist, return a user code of 4 if it was
           created before today's date, or return a user code of 0 if
           the dataset was created today.

           Occasionally there is a common need for current data.
           Sometimes, such data is created as an extracted subset of
           a much larger file or via an expensive procedure.  The end
           result might be duplicated efforts for the same data.

           This program will allow checking first to see if a current
           common file exists before recreating it.  The program works
           for sequential, PDS and VSAM datasets.

           If your have multiple copies of the same data being generated
           on the same day, this program might save both money and time.

           To determine the creation status of a file, enter the dataset
           name as a parm to the CHKTODAY program.  If you are using a
           USER CATALOG other than SYS1.USERCAT1, then place it in the
           step JCL as a STEPCAT statement.  JCL follows:


           //         JOB (         ),'            ',REGION=512K,MSGCLASS=A,
           //       MSGLEVEL=( , ),CLASS= ,NOTIFY=
           //JOBCAT   DD DSN=SYS1.USERCAT1,DISP=SHR
           //*
           //CHKITOUT EXEC PGM=CHKTODAY,PARM='YOUR.DATASET.NAME'        '
           //STEPCAT  DD DSN=YOUR.USERCAT.IF.NOT.USERCAT1,DISP=SHR
           //STEPLIB  DD DSN=WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD,DISP=SHR
           //SYSUDUMP DD SYSOUT=*


           Once the step executes, simply check the condition codes to see
           if the file is OK to use or should be recreated.
