  COMMAND NAME:       FILEINFO
  AUTHOR:             Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:             WDPSC
  FUNCTION:           The FILEINFO  command is intended for  use in
                      command procedures.  This  command returns to
                      the CLIST (thru  CLIST variables) information
                      about  that  file  such  as  LRECL,  BLKSIZE,
                      RECFM,  DSORG, volume  serial number,  device
                      type, number of used tracks and extents.

  Operands -

    Required -

         DSN('dataset name')      -- 'dataset name' is  the dataset
                                  name of the dataset that you wish
                                  to   receive   file   information
                                  about.  If the data-  set name is
                                  not  quoted,  then   the  PROFILE
                                  PREFIX will be appended.  You may
                                  provide a member name of a PDS if
                                  you  wish.   This   command  will
                                  return in  CLIST variable  MEMFND
                                  'YES' if  the member is  found in
                                  the directory  and 'NO' if  it is
                                  not found in the directory.

            Optional:

                 VOL('vol ser')      'vol  ser' is  to be  used if
                                     your file is not cataloged.

                 MEM('member name')  'member name'  is the  member
                                     name  of  the   PDS  named  by
                                     'dataset name'.   This command
                                     will return in  CLIST variable
                                     MEMFND 'YES' if  the member is
                                     found  in  the  directory  and
                                     'NO' if it is not found in the
                                     directory.

  After execution  of this command,  the following  CLIST variables
  are set.  Their names and contents are as follows:

        CLIST

                      b.   Quotes now stripped off.
                      c.   Member name included, if and only if, member
                           name was provided in the DSN keyword, other-
