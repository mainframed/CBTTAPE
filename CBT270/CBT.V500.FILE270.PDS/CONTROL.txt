                   WDPSC STATUS REPORT SYSTEM


    This status report system requires the structure of the WDPSC DOCSYS
    to function.  That system requires ISPF/DM.  The panel definitions
    and processing are supported by features of DOCSYS.


    USER FLOW OF THE SYSTEM:

    The system consists of several screens.  A system selection screen,
    a month selection screen and a screen listing the individual users.

    The month selection screen also contains the CONTROL data.  This
    data is contained in a dataset - _____.______.CONTROL.  The name
    and location of this dataset determines the name and location of
    the monthly datasets.  They will be placed on the same volume it
    is located on and will have names like  ______.______.JAN86 where
    the _____ matches the qualifier of the Control file.
    DCB Characteristics of these OS PDS datasets are:
        RECFM=VB,LRECL=     ,BLKSIZE=

    The monthly datasets will be created the first time the month is
    selected by anyone and the control dataset's PATTERN member (as it
    exists at that time) will be copied into the monthly dataset.  All
    monthly datasets as well as the control dataset have copies of the
    Pattern member.  Be aware that these may be different depending on
    changes which may have been made to the PATTERN.

    When a user selects his name on the user screen he is in browse
    mode.  If the member is empty an error message - NOT AVAILABLE will
    be returned to him.

    When a user Edits his name on the user screen for the first time a
    copy of the current pattern member from the monthly dataset will be
    copied into the member.  The user may then delete any topics which
    do not apply to him and begin inserting data under any topics which
    are applicable.

    When several people have entered their data the 'boss' may wish
    to Edit the member called Consolidated.  It does a real-time merge
    of the data contained in the other members of the monthly dataset
    and places it in member ALL (a required member name).  This merge
    relies on the topic lines from the monthly dataset's PATTERN member
    matching those topic lines in the user's data. Take care when altering
    a pattern which people may have already begun using.

    There are messages at the top of the Consolidated data indicating
    which of the users contributed to the merge - remember they may have
    only entered one line, thus the recommendation of a DONE/INPROGRESS
    topic in the pattern.  Each time the Consolidated member is Edited a
    merge is done.  To view what was present the last time without doing
    a merge do a Select on the member instead of an Edit.

    When the data in the Consolidated member is 'done'.  Edit the
    'To boss' entry.  This will copy the data from the consolidated
    member into another one (FINAL - also a required name) where it may
    be edited for submission to 'the boss'.  Only an Edit done when
    member FINAL is empty will result in a copy from the consolidated
    member.

    Any of the selections may be printed by using P.
    The screen displayed is used elsewhere in DOCSYS for printing of
    data.  Options available are ROTATE90, 3800 FTL or VPS to a cluster
    printer.

    PATTERN HINTS:
    The Pattern topics are single line entries and are required to have
    a X'aa' at the start of the topic line.
    Patterns may be underscored by using +_______ with the + in col 1.
    Any data other than that on the topic or underscore lines will
    be copied into individual reports and merged along with real data
    into the merged reports (thus being repeated n times).  i.e. single
    line topics are best.

    A recommended topic for inclusion is one which indicates whether
    users are DONE or IN PROGRESS with changes to their members.
    Without this editing of FINAL data may begin before all user entries
    are available.

  1 UPDATES OF THE SYSTEM PANELS

    NEW YEAR UPDATE:
     E  the system selection line. There is a reference to the year in
        the first 80 characters and again as you scroll to the right.
        Update those references and END the screen.
     Go to the month selection screen.
     E  each of the months.  There is a reference to the year after you
        scroll to the right.  Update that reference and END the screen.

     NEW USER UPDATE:
      Go to the month selection screen.
      E  each month.  Repeat an existing user line (not one of the special
         ones - just a normal user line).  Change the new line to contain
         the new user's name in the selection area.  Scroll to the right
         and specify the users name there too (must be appropriate for use
         as a PDS member name).
         END the screen.

      NEW GROUP USING SYSTEM:
       Verify their access to the clists, panels and skels required to
       support the STATUS system functions - found on the various panels
       of the system.  If they have no access then provide it to them.
       How varies with the case.

       Decide on high level qualifiers.
       CREATE a dataset  'hiqual'.'nextqual'.CONTROL
       Create the screens required for month and user selection.
          Easy if you copy from an existing system.
       Keep member names PATTERN, ALL and FINAL on the setup panels.
          These names are system requirements.
       Do PR & training and GO.
