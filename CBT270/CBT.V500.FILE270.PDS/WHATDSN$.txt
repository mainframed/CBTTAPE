  COMMAND NAME:       WHATDSN
  AUTHOR:             Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:             WDPSC
  FUNCTION:           The WHATDSN  command is  intended for  use in
                      command procedures.  This  command returns to
                      the  CLIST the  DSNAME(s)  of the  dataset(s)
                      which is/are allocated to the DDNAME given.

  This command is used to pass back to the CLIST:

       .    Only the DSNAME of the dataset  which is "at the top of
            the  stack" (if  several datasets  are concatenated  to
            that DDNAME.
  OR
       .    The DSNAME of each and every dataset (up to nine) which
            are allocated to the DDNAME.

       Required -

            DDNAME('ddname)     'ddname'  is the  DDNAME for  which
                                you wish to know the data set name.

                                FILE is an alias for DDNAME.

       Optional -

            ALL                 If ALL is given,  this command will
                                return all of the DSNAMEs which may
                                be  concatenated to  the DDNAME  in
                                CLIST  variables  &DSNAME1  through
                                DSNAME9  and DSNSCNT  will  contain
                                the   total   number   of   DSNAMEs
                                associated    with   the    DDNAME.
                                (&DSNSCNT  may   contain  a   value
                                greater than nine.)

                                If ALL is NOT  given, then only the
                                DSNAME that is concatenated "at the
                                top of the stack"  is given.  It is
                                returned in &DSNAME.

       This command will also return a return code representing the
       success or nonsuccess of this command.
