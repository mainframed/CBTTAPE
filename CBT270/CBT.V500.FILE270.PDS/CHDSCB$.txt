0Function -
 The CHDSCB Clist is for use when you wish to change the record format,
 logical record length, blocksize or DSORG of a dataset without
 modifying the data. The dataset is allocated with DISP=MOD and opened
 for output, then closed without writing any data. This causes the DSCB
 to be rewritten with the DCB data you specify. It is useful if a job
 has accidentally modified the blocksize of a library for example.
 WARNING: although the system prevents some types of changes, you can
 still get in trouble with this, so you should know what you are doing!
 NOTE: characteristics not specified will not be changed.

-Operands -
0 Required    - dsn.
-  dsn        - Name of dataset to be modified.
0  RECFM(rfm) - rfm is the format you desire (for example FBA).
0  LRECL(lrl) or LR(lrl) - lrl is the record length you desire.
0  BLKSIZE(blksi) or BLK(blksi) - blksi is the blocksize to set.
0  DSORG(org) - org is the new dataset organization. System will not
                allow changing PO to anything else, maybe others.
0  NOLIST     - dataset characteristics are not to be listed before and
                after modification.                                     .
-Example -
0 Assume you have a dataset named A.LIB ;
0 You then execute clist %CHDSCB as follows:
0  %CHDSCB  'A.LIB'  BLKSIZE(3120)
0 The blocksize of the dataset will be changed to 3120.
