1          FX (file transmit)
0FX is a file transmitter.  This utility as supplied will transmit
 a data set to up to 15 destinations.  The utility uses the IBM
 utilities DF/DSS and IEBCOPY for much of the "dirty" work, therefore
 both the sending and receiving ends must use a compatable version of
 of DF/DSS and IEBCOPY.
0The utility utilizes the LU 6.2 protocol, so you must be at a level
 of VTAM that supports LU 6.2.  The "master file" is either a VSAM
 linear data set or a direct access (BDAM) data set.  If VSAM linear is
 used, the data is accessed via the DIV access method and utilizes a
 data space.  The data space is addressed using AR mode, so you must
 be at a level of MVS/DPV that supports DIV and AR mode (MVS/ESA).
 This utility is strictly MVS based, there is no provision for
 transmitting data sets to or from VSE, VM, PC's, AS/400's, etc.
-The major component of FX is a started task (FXSTC).  Since this
 task must access any data sets that it is requested to transmit, and
 to re-create them on the receiving ends, it would have to have RACF
 access to do this.  It would probably be better to run the started
 task with the RACF TRUSTED attribute, rather than granting access to
 individual data sets.  Before FX will transmit a data set for a user,
 FX makes a third party check of that user's access to the data set
 to be transmitted.  The user must have READ level access to the data
 set on the sending system before FX will accept the request.  Each
 destination checks the user's access to the data set (the new name if
 a new name was given, or the original name if new name was omitted),
 the use must have ALTER level access before the data set will be
 restored.
-Access to the started task is either via TSO or batch.  When a user
 accesses FX, FX checks their RACF access to a resource (the RACF
 CLASS and ENTITY are defined in module FXSUID).  If the user has
 READ level access to this resource, they will be a "normal" FX user.
 "Normal" users may enter transmission requests and inquire on the
 status of their own requests.  A normal user may CANCEL his own
 requests.  If the user has UPDATE level access, they have the
 additional authority to shut-down and snap-shot the FX started task.
 If the user has ALTER level access, they are an ADMINISTRATOR level
 user.  Administrators have the additional authority to inquire on
 any transmission requests, they may CANCEL any user's requests, and
 they may DELETE any user's requests.  CANCELing a request flags the
 request as CANCELLED, but it remains in the master file until running
 the offline purge program (FXPURGE).  DELETEing a request removes the
 request from the master file immediately.  The difference is that
 FXPURGE makes an audit or history file output of the requests that
 it "purges", so a record of the request may be saved.  If a request
 is DELETEd, there will be no record of the request in the FXPURGE
 history output file.
-Basically how does FX work?  The FX started task must be brought
 up.  Then a user may enter a request via the TSO or batch interfaces.
 The data set must be cataloged.  The requesting user's RACF access to
 the requested data set is checked, they must have READ level access.
 The destination names are verified, and if all are valid, the request
 is "accepted" and recorded in the MASTER file.  FX then does a IDCAMS
 LISTCAT.  This tells FX the volumes where the data set resides, and if
 the data set is a VSAM data set, the component names (these are the
 names that appear in the VTOCs).  Then the VTOCs of the volumes where
 the data set resides are read.  The format-4 records of the VTOC tells
 FX the track size and number of tracks per cylinder for this device.
 From the extent information and this device information, FX calculates
 a total number of bytes that the extents contain.  If the total size
 excedes the MAX SIZE parameter, the request is rejected.  If the size
 is acceptable, using this total size, FX converts it into an
 equivalent number of tracks on a STAGE volume (stage volumes are
 defined via control statements), using the format-4 data from those
 volumes.  A "staging" data set is allocated using this calculated
 number of tracks, with a 10 percent secondary amount.  The staging
 data set is allocated using the RLSE parameter, so any unused space
 will be freed.  FX then allocates 2 more 1 track "staging" data sets,
 one for SYSIN, and one for SYSPRINT.  Control statements are built
 for DF/DSS or IEBCOPY to DUMP the data set or member.  A request is
 generated for either the DF/DSS or IEBCOPY subtask.  When the dump
 (or for IEBCOPY the unload) completes, if it was unsuccessful, the
 status is updated and the processing is essentially complete.  If
 If the dump was successful, the overall status is changed to
 "READY TO TRANSMIT".  When one of the receiving nodes is ready,
 FX transmits the dump or unloaded data to the receiving node.  The
 first record sent to the receiving node tells that node how large the
 staging data set was so it can convert the size into a staging data set
 on its own stage volumes.  Then as the data is transmitted by the
 sender, it is re-created on the receiving end.  When the data has been
 completely transmitted, the receiving node allocates 2 one track data
 sets, one for the SYSIN, and one for the SYSPRINT.  A request is
 generated for its DF/DSS or IEBCOPY subtask to restore the data set or
 member.  When the restore operation completes, the success or failure
 is recorded in the master file, and a "success" or "failure" status is
 transmitted to the sender to notify the sender of the status at the
 receiving end.  When the last (or only) destination has received and
 then responded with the success or failure of the restore operation,
 the over-all status is changed to COMPLETE.  On the receiving end the
 status is "complete"  when the restore operation completes, whether it
 was successful or not.
-Since FX allocates staging data sets to transmit and receive files,
 these staging data sets may contain sensitive data.  FX uses the
 DF/DSS COMPRESS option, so the data is failry unreadable, but you
 may still want to RACF protect these staging data sets.  If DF/DSS
 or IEBCOPY return with a return code other than zero, the process
 (DUMP, RESTORE, or IEBCOPY unload or load) is considered to have
 failed.  The messages produced by DF/DSS or IEBCOPY will be in one
 of these staging data sets.  To allow users to see these messages,
 option "O" on the TSO inquiry causes the FX started task to read the
 messages and send them to the user where they can be browsed.
-You may wonder why FX first dumps a data set and then transmits it.
 This serves several purposes.  First if a data set is to be transmitted
 to multiple destinations, you probably want all destinations to receive
 the same copy of the data.  Taking a DF/DSS DUMP or an IEBCOPY unload
 "freezes" the data at a given point in time, then if the original data
 set is updated or even deleted, the data sent to all the destinations
 will be the same.  Also for full data set transmissions, DF/DSS does
 a lot of "dirty" work like conversion to and from devices of unlike
 track size.  DF/DSS also re-creates the data set with the same space
 allocation, for PDSes the same number of directory blocks, for VSAM
 all the same CLUSTER options (like KEYS, SHR, RECORDSIZE, etc).
 The output from DF/DSS or IEBCOPY is always a sequential file, it
 is in a predictable form that can be easily read, transmitted,
 and written.  If the data set uses the direct access method (BDAM)
 or some other method, the DF/DSS ALLDATA option is used to cause all
 of the data to be dumped an restored reqardless of where the
 "end-of-data" indicator may point.  The the DF/DSS COMPRESS option
 option is also used to reduce the size of the dumped data sets, and
 the amount of time needed to transmit the data through a network.
 DF/DSS and IEBCOPY are also IBM supported products, if a new access
 method, device type, etc is developed, IBM will probably keep its own
 utilities updated to handle them.
-A request is given an ID that is used in all messages.  The id is
 ENODE NNN.  Enode is the FX node where the request was entered.   NNN
 is a sequential number assigned when the request is accepted.
-Formatting the master file resets the number to 1.  All FX messages
 at both the sending and receiving end(s) will use this ID to refer
 to activity related to the same requests.

1           FX (File Xmit) batch user interface parameters
0Statements begin in column 1 and no statements may be continued.
 An asterisk (*) in column 1 denotes the statement as a comment.
 Comments may appear at any point in the control statements.
-ALIAS                If transmitting a PDS member, any aliases will
                      also be transmitted.  This statement is not valid
                      unless the MEMBER= statement is also used.
-ATTEMPTS=nnn         If the FX STC cannot be contacted, the user
    or                interface will wait for the number of seconds
 ATTEMPTS=UNLIMITED   specified in the INTERVAL= parameter.  The
                      number of tries is specified by the ATTEMPTS=
                      parameter.  The value must be either 1 to 3 digits
                      or 'UNLIMITED'.
-FX=luname            Defines the LU name of the FX STC that the
                      user wishes to communicate with.
-DSN=dataset          For a transmission request, this is the data set
                      to be transmitted.  The requesting user must have
                      RACF ALTER level access to this data set.
-DEST=destination     For a transmission request, this is one of (or the
                      only destination) to receive the data set.  This
                      destination must be defined as a DESTINATION or
                      FXNODE in the control statements of the FX STC
                      referenced in the FX= statement.
-INTERVAL=nnn         If the FX STC cannot be contacted, the user
                      interface will wait for the specified number of
                      seconds and will try again.  The number of tries
                      is controlled by the ATTEMPTS= parameter.
-MEMBER=memname       For a transmission request, this is the name of
                      a member in the PDS named on the DATASET=
                      statement.  The name may be either a member name
                      or an alias for the member.  If the ALIAS
                      statement is used, the base member and all aliases
                      will be transmitted whether the name used on this
                      statement is the base name or one of its aliases.
-NEWMEM=memname       When transmitting a PDS member it may be renamed
                      at the receiving nodes.  This statement is not
                      valid if the ALIAS statement is also used.
-NEW DSN=name         For a transmission entry request, by default the
                      data set will be restored with the same name as
                      the original data set name.  NEWNAME= specifies
                      that the data set is to be restored with a
                      different name.  Note that if the data set is
                      transmitted to multiple destinations it will have
                      the same name at all receiving nodes.
-REPLACE              If transmitting an entire data set, DF/DSS will
                      replace an existing data set at each destination
                      with the data being transmitted.  If transmitting
                      a PDS member, it and any aliases transmitted will
                      replace any like-named members in the receiving
                      data set at each destination.
-STATUS=enode,nbr     To inquire on the status of an existing request,
                      use the STATUS= statement.  enode is the node
                      where the request was entered and nbr is a
                      sequential number assigned by the entry node.  FX
                      always returns a message that gives the enode and
                      nbr values when a request is accepted.
-XMITFX=fxnode        When a tranmission request is entered, the default
                      is for the entry FX STC to be the transmitting
                      node.  the XMITFX= statement allows a request to
                      be entered at a node other than the transmitting
                      node.  For example if FX node A, B, and C exist
                      in a network, a user could enter a request at node
                      A to have a data set transmitted from node B to
                      node C (the user does not have to enter the request
                      at node B).  You may also enter a request at node
                      A to have a data set transmitted from node B or C
                      back to node A.
-NOTES
 The DATASET, DEST, NEWNAME, and XMITFX statements are mutually
 exclusive with the STATUS statement.  You may only enter one transmission
 or status inquiry per execution.
-The ALIAS statement is not valid unless the MEMBER= statement is used.
-If transmitting a PDS member with its aliases, you cannot also rename
 the member at the same time.  Therefore the NEWMEM= statement is
 mutually exclusive with the ALIAS statement.
-The NEWMEM statement is not allowed without a MEMBER statement.
-To enter a request to transmit data set ABC.XYZ from NODEA to NODEB..
0     FX=NODEA
      DATASET=ABC.XYZ
      DEST=NODEB
0In this example data set ABC.XYZ would be transmitted from NODEA to
 NODEB and restored at NODEB with the same name (ABC.XYZ).  The request
 could be queried by:
0     FX=NODEA
      STATUS=NODEA,nnn   (depends on the number assigned)
0The enode parameter is NODEA because that is the node where the request
 was entered.
 The same data set could have been transmitted by:
0     FX=NODEB
      XMITFX=NODEA
      DATASET=ABC.XYZ
      DEST=NODEB
0In this case the enode on a STATUS statement would be NODEB because it
 is the node where the request was entered.  If you used:
0     FX=NODEA
      DATASET=ABC.XYZ
      NEWNAME=DEF.XYZ
      DEST=NODEB
0The data set ABC.XYZ would be transmitted from NODEA to NODEB.  The
 enode value on a STATUS statement would still be NODEA.  The data set
 would be restored as DEF.XYZ at NODEB.
0The request is known at both the transmitting and receiving nodes by
 the same ID (enode,nbr).  You may inquire on the status of the request
 at either the transmitting node or one of (or the only) receiving node.
0     FX=NODEA
      DATASET=ABC.XYZ
      MEMBER=MEMA
      NEWNAME=DEF.XYZ
      DEST=NODEB
0Member MEMA of data set ABC.XYZ would be transmitted to FX node NODEB,
 and copied into data set DEF.XYZ at NODEB.  If MEMA already exists in
 data set DEF.XYZ, it will not be replaced, and the request will still
 be considered successful (IEBCOPY will end with return code zero).
0     FX=NODEA
      DATASET=ABC.XYZ
      MEMBER=MEMA
      NEWNAME=DEF.XYZ
      NEWMEM=MEM2
      DEST=NODEB
      REPLACE
0Member MEMA of data set ABC.XYZ would be transmitted to FX node NODEB.
 At NODEB, the member would be copied into data set DEF.XYZ under the
 name MEM2.  If MEM2 already exists in data set DEF.XYZ it will be
 replaced.
0     FX=NODEA
      DATASET=ABC.XYZ
      MEMBER=MEMA
      NEWNAME=DEF.XYZ
      DEST=NODEB
      ALIAS
0Member MEMA and any aliases of MEMA would be transmitted to FX node
 NODEB, and copied into data set DEF.XYZ at NODEB.  Like-named members
 already in data set DEF.XYZ will not be replaced.

0Statements begin in column 1 and no statements may be continued.
 An asterisk (*) in column 1 denotes the statement as a comment.
 Comments may appear at any point in the control statements.
-COPY         Entire master file is copied to NEWSEQ, the master
              file is not altered.  Essentially this is a way to
              turn the master file into a sequential file.
-RETPDC=nnn   Retention period in days for requests that
              are in a complete or error status.  1 to 3 digits.
-RETPDU=nnn   Retention period in days for requests that
              have not been completed.  In order for a request to
              be in completed status, all destinations have to
              respond with the status of the restore (success or
              failure).  If for some reason a node does not or
              cannot respond, the RETPDU allows the requests to
              be purged.  RETPDU should probably be set to some
              relatively long period.  1 to 3 digits.
-      When COPY is requested, RETPDC and RETPDU must not be given.
       When RETPDC is given, RETPDU is also required and vice-versa.
       When a request is purged, the stage, sysin, and
       sysprint datasets are scratched, the master file record
       is copied to NEWSEQ, then reset to "free" status.
0      When purging records (RETPDC and RETPDU are given), the
       program expects to copy any records in OLDSEQ to NEWSEQ
       and then copy any master file records being purged to
       NEWSEQ.  This provides a cumulative history of requests
       purged if the output of one run is input as OLDSEQ to
       the next run.  The sample JCL in FX.JCLLIB illustrates this
       using a GDG.

1                 FX (File Xmit) INSTALLATION
0 1. Create the following JCL to allocate the JCL library:
-      //.....    JOB .........
       //BLDJCL   EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY
       //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*

         COPY INDD=FILE1,OUTDD=FXJCL
       /*
       //
0   Notes:
        1. Add a JOB card valid at your installation.
        2. Change the prefix on the data set name on the FXJCL DD
           statement.
        3. Change the UNIT and VOLSER on the FXJCL DD statement.
        4. The SPACE is based on 3380's.
        5. Change the UNIT to a suitable tape drive unit on the FILE1
           DD statement.
- 2. Allocate and load the FX datasets.  Edit and submit FX.JCLLIB
     member ALLOC.
- 3. Edit member OPTIONS in FX.MACLIB.   See member OPTIONS in
     FX.DOC for a description of the option keywords.
  ** Specially important is to select which type of MASTER file you want
     (VSAM or BDAM).
- 4. Assemble all FX modules.  Edit and submit JCLLIB member ASSEMBLE.
- 5. Link-edit all FX modules.  Edit and submit JCLLIB member LINK.
- 6. Define the master file.  For VSAM, submit member ALLOVSAM.
     For BDAM, edit and submit member ALLOBDAM.
- 7. Format the master file.  Edit and submit member FORMAT.
- 8. Define the VTAM APPLs.  The FX started task has a control
     statement (APPL=) that tells the STC which APPL id it should use,
     and in step 3, ACB names are defined for the user interfaces to
     use when communicating with the STC.  All of these names must be
     defined to VTAM.  For example a member in VTAMLST could be:
0                VBUILD TYPE=APPL
       FXSTC     APPL  APPC=YES
       FXAPPLA   APPL  APPC=YES
                  .
                  .
                  .
       FXAPPLJ   APPL  APPC=YES
0     If the APPLs are defined in a separate member of VTAMLST, add it
      to the list of nodes automatically activated at VTAM start-up.
- 9. Edit the FX exec in FX.CLIST.  Change the FX_NODE = statement
     to the name you will use for the FX STC APPL name (APPL= parameter
     in the STC start-up JCL).  Change the prefix on the ISPPLIB LIBDEF
     statement.
-10  Edit the FX1 EXEC in FX.CLIST.  Change the prefix on the ISPPLIB
     LIBDEF statement.
-11. Edit the FXM EXEC in FX.CLIST.  Change data set name for the
     master file to the name you used in the step 6.
-12  Edit the FXM1 EXEC in FX.CLIST. Change the prefix on the ISPPLIB
     LIBDEF statement.
-13. Edit member FXSTC in FX.JCLLIB.  Change the prefix on the STEPLIB
     and FXIN DD's.   Change the data set name in the MASTER DD to the
     name of your master file.
-14. Copy the FXSTC to a PROCLIB.
-15. APF authorize the FX.LOADLIB.
-16. You may want to add the FX.LOADLIB to your system's LNKLST.
     If you do you may remove the STEPLIBs in all the JCLLIB
     members.  If you do not, the library must be available to TSO users
     and batch jobs.  For TSO users, you can add the library to the
     STEPLIB or ISPLLIB in the user's TSO proc's or allocate it
     dynamically in the FX exec if you have TSOPLUS or a similar
     product.  For the batch jobs, add a STEPLIB to the user's jobs.
-17. Create a start-up control statement member in FX.JCLLIB.  Member
     STCPARM member of FX.JCLLIB may be used as a starting point.
     See member STCPARM of FX.DOC for a description of the control
     statements.
-18. Add the FX STC to RACF module ICHRIN03 as a TRUSTED id, or grant
     the STC access to all data sets it will dump/restore and to the
     staging data sets it uses.
-19. RACF protect the staging data sets.  See parameter STAGEPRFX in
     FX.DOC(STCPARM) for how the stage data sets are named.
-20. If you want FX to keep a running log of purged requests, define
     a GDG base.  You probably should use the same data set name
     prefix as the rest of FX and use a RACF profile that will protect
     all FX data sets.
-21. You should be able to start-up the FX STC.
-22. Add the FX EXEC's to a library accessable to TSO users.
-23. FX should be ready to go...

   As supplied FX is designed with 15 destinations (max) per
   transmission request.  If you wish to change this number
   (upward or downward):

   Just a warning... all FX nodes that communicate with each other
   must have the same MAXNODE value in their install OPTIONS.

   If you keep the output from FXPURGE as history or for audit
   reasons, the output LRECL will change.  The previously purged
   records will have to be kept on a separate history file.

   Change the MAXNODE value in the OPTIONS member of FX.MACLIB.

   Re-assemble and re-link all FX modules.

   If you use the COBOL parameter copy book USERCOB, change the
   "OCCURS 1 TO nn TIMES" value to the number used for MAXNODE.

   Re-run the master file formatter... the numeric portion of the
   request ID's will start over with 000001.

0FXBPARM28E DUPLICATE STATUS REQUEST
    The batch user interface only allows one status request (or one
    transmission request) to be entered per execution.  You have supplied
    multiple STATUS= statements.  If you need to inquire on the status
    of multiple requests, execute the batch interface utility multiple
    times.  Remove the extra STATUS= statements.
0FXBPARM29E REQUEST NUMBER OMITTED
    Format of the STATUS statement is enode,nbr where enode is the node
    where the request was entered and nbr is the request number assigned
    by that node when the request was accepted.  You have omitted the
    nbr portion of the statement.
0FXBPARM30E REQUEST NUMBER IS TOO LONG (9 DIGITS MAX)
    The request number on a STATUS= statement must be 1 to 9 digits.
    You have specified a value more than 9 digits long.
0FXBPARM31E INVALID DIGIT IN REQUEST NUMBER
    The request number on a STATUS= statement must be 1 to 9 digits.
    You have specified a value with a non-numeric value.
0FXBPARM32E NODE NAME OMITTED ON A STATUS REQUEST
    Format of the STATUS= statement is enode,nbr where enode is the node
    where the request was entered and nbr is a sequential number assigned
    by the entry node when the request is accepted.  You have omitted the
    enode value.
0FXBPARM33E XMITFX NAME OMITTED
    Self explanitory.
0FXBPARM34E XMITFX NAME IS TOO LONG
    The XMITFX= statement gives the LU name of the FX STC that is to
    transmit the requested data set when the request is entered at a node
    other than the transmitting node.  The LU name is limited by VTAM to
    8 characters or less.
0FXBPARM35E DUPLICATE XMITFX STATEMENT
    A request may have only one transmitting node, but mutliple receiving
    nodes.  Usually the transmitting node is the node where the request
    is entered.  FX allows a node other than the node where the request
    was entered to transmit the data set.  In this case the XMITFX=
    statement specifies the transmitting node's LU name, only one XMITFX=
    statement is allowed.  Remove the unneeded XMITFX= statement(s).

-           MESSAGES FROM THE BATCH USER INTERFACE QUERY
0FXBREQI01W NODE DATA TRUNCATED DUE TO USER AREA SIZE
    The MAXNODE parameter in the OPTIONS member of FX.MACLIB is used by
    both the STC and batch user interface when they are assembled.  The
    the MAXNODE parameter used for the FX STC assembly was larger than
    the MAXNODE value used for the batch user interface assembly, and
    the number of destinations in the request you queried is more than
    the batch user interface MAXNODE value.  The status information
    was truncated.  The batch user interface should be re-assembled
    with the same MAXNODE value used for the FX STC.
0FXBREQI02I OVER-ALL STATUS IS xxxxxxxxxxxx
    As FX processes a request its status is updated to reflect the
    state the request is in at any given time.
0FXBREQI03I STATUS TO DESTINATION FXNODE nnnnnnnn IS: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    The transmitting node is the "control" point of a request.  As
    FX transmits data and receives restore notifications, the status
    to each receiving node is updated.  When the data has been
    transmitted to all destinations, and the restore status has been
    received from all destinations, the over-all status will be
    "complete".

    FXPRT is a required JCL DD statement.  Add the FXPRT DD to your
    STC JCL, and restart the STC.
0FXSMAIN02I  PRINT SUBTASK ATTACHED
    FX runs as multiple tasks and has asynchronous VTAM exits.  This
    means that multiple tasks could generate messages at the same time.
    To keep messages in chronological order, and to prevent the need to
    "merge" multiple sysout data sets to determine what happend in what
    order, all sysprint is sent to the same output DD.  Rather than try
    to serialize a DCB, all printing is done by a print subtask.  This
    message informs you that the print subtask has been ATTACHed and is
    active.
0FXSMAIN03I  INITIALIZATION STARTING
    Self explanitory.
0FXSMAIN04E  REQUIRED DD dddddddd IS NOT PRESENT
    See the FXSTC member of FX.JCLLIB for a sample of the STC JCL,

    Refer to the FXSMAIN09E messages to find out which DD statements
    you omitted.
0FXSMAIN06I  EXTERNAL TRACE SUBTASK ATTACHED
    FX has an internal trace table to aid in problem determination.  If
    FX loops, it may be difficult to determine how the loop started. If
    the FXSXTR DD is present in the start-up JCL, the entries recorded
    in the internal trace table will also be written to this DD.  Like
    print, trace entries are generated by multiple tasks.  Like printing
    rather than serialize a DCB (and slow the main proccessing), the
    trace entries are written by a separate subtask.  This message
    informs you that the trace subtask has been ATTACHed and is active.
0FXSMAIN07I  MASTER FILE INITIALIZATION COMPLETE
    If FX was sending, receiving, dumping, or restoring a data set at
    the time of a failure, appropriate "clean-up" or restart steps are
    taken.  If any of these situations existed during the start-up,
    messages will be issued describing the status the request was in,
    what was done to "clean-up" or restart the request.  This message
    implies that are all requests are in a known state and that FX
    is proceding with start-up.
0FXSMAIN08I  DF/DSS SUBTASK ATTACHED
    Since FX has no control over what DF/DSS does (once DF/DSS gets
    control, FX has to wait for it to complete before continuing), the
    DF/DSS work is done under a separate subtask.  This message informs
    you that the sub-task is attached and active.
0FXSMAIN09I  IEBCOPY SUBTASK ATTACHED
    FX has no control over what IEBCOPY does (once IEBCOPY gets control
    FX has to wait for it to complete before continuing).  Also IEBCOPY
    is prone to X37 abends.  For these reasons, the IEBCOPY work is done
    under a subtask.  This message informs you that the subtask has
    been successfully ATTACHed and is active.
0FXSMAIN10I  ERROR(S) DETECTED IN CONTROL STATEMENTS, EXECUTION ABORTED
    Errors were detected in the control statements, messages should have

    when the transmission is complete, this is a normal message.
0FXSRECV05E  CONVERSATION DEALLOCATED DURING RECEIVE OF REQUEST enode nbr dddddd
    A data set was being received from another FX node when the
    conversation was de-allocated prematurely.  The staging data set is

    nbr is the REQUEST ID.
0FXSRECV10E  INSUFFICIENT SPACE ON STAGE DEVICES
    When FX transmits a data set, it creates a "dump", and then
    transmits the dump.  At a receiving node, the first record received
    informs the receiving node of the size of the original data set
    in bytes.  The receiving node then tries to allocate a staging
    data set on its STAGE volume(s) of an equivalent size.  If there
    is insufficient space on the STAGE volume(s), the data set cannot
    be received.  The sender is notified, and the status at the sending
    end for this node will be updated accordingly.

0FXSREQE01E nnnnnnnnn IS NOT A VALID TRANSMITTING NODE NAME
    FX will accept "aliases" (defined on the DESTINATION= statements in
    the FX STC start-up parameters) for receiving node names.   As of
    now, if a request is entered at one node that is to be transmitted
    by a different node, that node's LU name must be entered, "aliases"
    are not valid.  The value you entered does not match a FX node
    defined to the entry FX on a FXNODE= statement.
0FXSREQE02E NODE nnnnnnnn IS INVALID
    Destinations for a data set transmission must be defined to the

    transmitting node.
0FXSREQE03E MEM SIZE NOT DEFINED, PDS MEMBER TRANSMISSION NOT AVAILABLE
    FX requires the STC start-up parameter MEM SIZE before it will
    transmit a PDS member.  The MEM SIZE parameter was not given for the

    the MEM SIZE parameter to the STC start-up parameters and re-start
    the STC.

0FXSREQE08E NODE nnnnnnnn IS DUPLICATED
    You have specified the same node as a destination multiple times.
    FX can only send the data to a given destination once per request.
0FXSREQE09E YOU DO NOT HAVE ALTER LEVEL ACCESS TO REQUESTED DATA SET
    Before FX will transmit a data set for you, you must have RACF
    ALTER level access.  This is to prevent users from transmitting data
    sets to other locations (possibly under a new data set name) where
    they would have higher level of access to the data).  Also for full
    data set transmissions, FX must re-create the data at the destinations
    which requires alter level access.

    is provided to the STC by the RESTORE= statements in the STC start-
    up parameters.  If no RESTORE criteria matches the name (new name
    if the data set is to be renamed), FX does not know which volumes
    to pass on to the DF/DSS subtask.  The request is flagged in an

1           FX (File Xmit) global options
0These options are parameters to an assembler language macro, and
 therefore coding must conform to assembler language coding rules.
-INTERVL=   If FX attempts to contact another FX node to transmit
            a data set and that node is not in a ready state, it will
            wait a period of time before trying to contact that node
            again.  INTERVL specifies the time in seconds between
            attempts.
-MASTER=    Sets the type of master file used.  This may be either
            VSAM or BDAM.  If VSAM is used, you must be at a level of
            MVS that supports DIV and AR mode (MVS/ESA).
-MAXLINE=   Sets the number of lines per page on all FX SYSPRINT
            output.
-MAXNODE=   Sets the maximum number of destinations that a data set
            may be sent to on one request.  If this number is changed
            after FX is already installed, see member MAXNODE in FX.DOC.
-MAXSIZE=   Sets the maximum file size in bytes that FX will accept.
            Data sets that exceed this size will be rejected.  The
            larger this size is, the more STAGE volume space will be
            required.  This parameter may be over-ridden at STC start-up
            by the MAX SIZE= statement.
-TRACE=     Controls the internal trace macro (ITRACE).  If TRACE=ON,
            the internal trace points will be generated.  If TRACE=OFF,
            the internal trace points will not be generated.  The
            internal trace points are very helpful in problem
            determination, but they generate code that uses storage and
            CPU time.  FXSTC will be about 5000 bytes smaller, FXTSO
            will be about 1500 bytes smaller, and FXBATCH about 150
            bytes smaller with TRACE=OFF.
-TRSIZE=    Specifies the number of entries in the internal trace
            table.  Each trace entry is 32 bytes long.
-RACCLASS=  Sets the RACF CLASS used in checking the user's FX authority
            level.
-RACENT=    Sets the RACF ENTITY used in checking the user's FX
            authority level.  Users that have READ level access to the
            CLASS/ENTITY will be 'normal' users.  Users with UPDATE
            level access are OPERATOR level users and may snap-shot and
            shutdown the FX STC.   Users with ALTER level access are
            ADMINISTRATOR users.  ADMINISTRATOR level users have all
            normal user and OPERATOR user authority, plus ADMINISTATORs
            may inquire on the status of another user's requests.
            ADMINISTRATORs are the only users that may DELETE a request.
-UACB=      Sets the names in the ACB names table that the user
            interfaces (both TSO and BATCH) may use to communicate with
            FX STCs.  Up to 20 names are allowed.
-For example:
0        FXOPT MAXLINES=60,                                            +
               RACCLASS='RCLASS',       QUOTES ARE REQUIRED            +
               RACENT='RENTITY ',       QUOTES ARE REQUIRED            +
               UACB=(FXAPPLA,FXAPPLB,FXAPPLC,FXAPPLD,FXAPPLE,          +
                      FXAPPLF,FXAPPLG,FXAPPLH,FXAPPLI,FXAPPLJ)
-All FX SYSPRINT data sets will have 60 lines per page.
 The RACF class and entity will be RCLASS/RENTITY to determine the
 user's level of access to FX.   FXAPPLA, FXAPPLB, FXAPPLC, FXAPPLD,
 FXAPPLE, FXAPPLF, FXAPPLG, FXAPPLH, FXAPPLI, and FXAPPLJ will be
 ACB names available for user's to use when communicating with a FX
 STC.

1           FX (File Xmit) STC parameters
0Statements begin in column 1 and no statements may be continued.
 An asterisk (*) in column 1 denotes the statement as a comment.
 Comments may appear at any point in the control statements.
-APPLID=applname      Defines the APPLID (ACB name really) that the
                      STC will use to identify itself to VTAM.
-FXNODE=applname,smfid Defines the APPLID of a partner FX node.  All
                      nodes that this FX STC will allow data to be
                      sent to or received from must be defined via
                      FXNODE statements.  This is an attempt to prevent
                      a "hacker" from requesting that a data set be
                      transmitted to him or received from him.  Use
                      as many FXNODE statements as required to define
                      all the other FX STCs this FX STC will "talk"
                      to.  applname is the VTAM APPLID of the partner
                      FX node, smfid is the SMFID of the partner node.
                      The SMF id is used to convert the user ids of
                      requests coming from this partner (see the XUSER
                      control statement).
-DESTINATION=alias,applname  Most people don't or can not remember VTAM
                      APPLID's.  The DESTINATION statement allows you to
                      define an "alias" for the node.  You can define
                      multiple "aliases" for the same node.  For example
                      if you have a central site in Dallas, TX, you
                      could define CENTRAL, DALLAS, BIGD, etc as
                      aliases for the FX STC at that site.   The
                      applname must be defined via a FXNODE statement
                      before referring to it on a DESTINATION statement.
-MAX SIZE=nnnnnnnnn   Applies to full data set transmisstions.
                      Specifies the maximum file size in bytes that FX
                      will accept.  The size is determined by multiplying
                      the track size (determined from the format-4 in
                      VTOC) times the number of tracks on each device
                      the data set resides on.  For VSAM data sets all
                      components (data and index, etc) count toward
                      this total, alternate indexes will not be
                      transmitted and would not count toward the size.
                      Maximum value for MAX SIZE is 2GB.  Each data set
                      that FX has 'in the works' requires 3 control
                      data sets, one for a "dump" or "unload", one for
                      SYSIN statements, and one for the SYSPRINT.  The
                      The SYSIN and SYSPRINT data sets are always 1
                      1 track.  These data sets are scratched when the
                      request is DELETEd (requires ADMINISTRATOR level
                      FX authority), or PURGED via the offline utility
                      FXPURGE.   If you allow large data sets to be
                      transmitted, the space required on the STAGE
                      volumes (see the STAGE control statement will
                      will be large accordingly.  Also the larger the
                      data set being transmitted, the longer it will
                      take to transmit through your network, and the
                      more load it puts on your NCPs, transmission lines,
                      etc.
-MEM SIZE=nnnnnnnnn   Applies to PDS member transmission requests.
                      Since there is no size information in PDS
                      directories, the size could be determined by
                      reading the member and calculating its size from
                      the beginning and ending TTR.  This would mean
                      reading PDS members being transmitted an extra
                      time just to determine how large the stage data
                      set needs to be.  Rather than waste the time and
                      I/O's, the MEM SIZE is a "one-size-fits-all" PDS
                      member stage data set size.  If a PDS member is
                      too large, FX will not be able to transmit it.
                      Stage data sets are allocated with the RLSE
                      parameter so unused space is released.
-RESTORE=dataset.prefix,volser  For full data set transmissions, once
                      the data has been received by a destination FX
                      it must be restored.   The volume(s) the
                      data set is eligible to be restored on is given
                      on RESTORE statements.  If a given data set may
                      be restored to one of several volumes, use multiple
                      RESTORE statements with the same prefix and each
                      volume on a separate statement.  The search is a
                      'first hit' type.  The prefix does not stop on a
                      delimiter.  If you gave the statement:
0                         RESTORE  SYS1.X,VOL000
0                     data sets SYS1.XRAY, SYS1.X.Y.Z would match the
                      restore statement criteria, and FX would attempt
                      to restore it to volume VOL000.
                      To prevent having to have a RESTORE statement for
                      every possible data set name prefix, FX allows
                      you to define RESTORE statements with the prefix
                      "DEFAULT" which will match any data set prefix.
                      So -
0                         RESTORE  DEFAULT,VOLABC
0                     would define volume VOLABC as the default.
                      Multiple volumes may be given to DEFAULT the same
                      as for a data set name prefix.  Since the search
                      stops on the first match, put the most specific
                      statements (usually the prefix is longer) first
                      followed by the more general, and DEFAULT last.
                      If FX cannot find a RESTORE statement to match the
                      the data set being restored and no DEFAULT is given,
                      the status is updated with as being in an error
                      condition and processing for the request stops.
-STAGE=vvvvvv         Defines a volume that FX may use to allocate
                      staging data sets on.  FX uses staging data sets
                      for "dump" and "unload", SYSIN, and SYSPRINT.
-STAGEPRFX=prefix     Defines the prefix of the staging data sets.
                      The data sets will have a name of the form:
                      prefix.Dyyddd.Thhmmss.Dnnnnnnn.  The prefix may
                      be up to 20 characters long.
-SNAPCLASS=c          FX can "snap shot" many of its internal control
                      blocks and internal trace to a sysout data set
                      for diagnosing some problems without having to
                      shut-down the STC.  The SNAPCLASS statement
                      specifies the sysout class used for these snap-
                      shots.
-SYSNAME=name         FX users may enter and inquire on requests at
                      multiple FX nodes.   This parameter provides a
                      "name" that appears on the user's panels and on
                      the SNAPSHOT sysout datasets to identify which
                      FX STC the user is communicating with.
XUSER=smfid,userid1,userid2   A user may have different id's depending
                      on which system they have logged on to. this
                      statement allows FX to translate the id's of
                      external users to their local id.  smfid is the
                      SMF id of the partner node (must have a matching
                      entry on an FXNODE statement), userid1 is the
                      user's id on the partner node, and userid2 is the
                      user's id on the local node.

1          F(ile) X(mit) Users Guide
 FX will transmit sequential, direct access (DA), partitioned (PDS),
 and VSAM data sets.  A data set or PDS member can be sent to multiple
 destinations with the same request.  FX verifies that you have at least
 READ level access to the data on the sending end and ALTER level access
 on the receiving end(s).  When a request is entered, FX "snapshots" the
 data.  FX records the request in a data set of its own.  FX will
 transmit the data to each destination as soon as it they are available
 on the network.  By recording the request in a data set, FX can
 "remember" the request even if it or the entire system is shutdown or
 abends.  The "snapshot" of the data allows FX to send the same data
 to all destinations even if the data set is updated or deleted before
 all destinations are available to receive the data.
0FX has 4 panels, the main menu, the request entry, request query,
 and node list.  At FX invocation, you will be presented with the
 main menu.  To enter a request, select option 1, to query on the status
 of a request that you entered earlier, select option 2.  To exit from
 FX, select option X or press PF3 or PF4.
-          ENTERING A REQUEST
 To enter a request FX requires the data set name and at least 1
 destination.
0For a full data set transmission:
   Give the data set name, leave the member name blank.  If you want
   the data set to have the same name at the destination(s), leave the
   "New name" blank.  The member name and new member name must be blank.
   If the "replace" option is left blank, or set to "NO":
      If a new name was given, FX will try to create a data set with
         the new name.  If a new name was not given, FX will try to
         create a data set with the original name.
      In either case, if a data set with the same name already exists,
         FX will consider the result as a failure (error) condition and
         the existing data set will not be altered.
   If the "replace" option is set to "YES":
      If a new name was given, FX will create a data set with this
      name if no data set already exists, or will replace an existing
      data set.  If no new name was given, FX will create a data set
      with the original data set name if no data set already exists at
      the destination(s) or will replace an existing data set.
   The "Alias" option must be allowed to default or set to "NO".
0For a PDS member transmission:
   The data set name and member name must be given.  If the member
   name is left blank, FX assumes you want to transmit the entire
   data set.  FX will not transmit a PDS member to a sequential file,
   the receiving data set at the destination(s) must be an existing PDS.
   If the "new name" is left blank, FX will use the original data set
   name as the name of the PDS to receive the member.  If the new member
   name is left blank, FX will use the original member name.  If
   "replace" is left blank, or set to "NO", the member will not be
   replaced if it already exists.  NOTE: FX does NOT consider it an
   error if a member already exists and you specify REPLACE=NO.  FX will
   transmit a member and all aliases by specifying ALIAS=YES.  If
   ALIAS=YES is used, REPLACE must be allowed to default or set to NO.
   If the receiving data set does not exist, FX will NOT create it, it
   is considered an error.
0FX allows you to enter a request at one location, and have another
 location transmit the data.  For example if you are located at
 Bartlesville, and you want a data set on the Woking system transmitted
 to Bartlesville, you could invoke FX on the Bartlesville system and
 enter WOKING as the "transmit node" and Bartlesville as a (or the only)
 destination.  FX on the Bartlesville system will transfer the request
 to the Woking system.  FX on the Woking system will verify your access
 to the data set, and if you have the access, it will send the data to
 Bartlesville.
0Once you have entered all the required data on the request entry panel,
 press ENTER or tab to the COMMAND line and enter an "L" to bring up
 the destination (or node list) display (the node list display is
 described later in this guide).  After returning to this panel from
 the node list display, enter an "S" on the command line and press
 ENTER.  FX will edit check the data you have entered and verify that
 you have READ access to the data set you want to have transmitted.
 If any errors are detected, FX will display messages at the bottom
 of the panel describing the problem.  If no errors were detected, FX
 will assign a "request ID" to the request and will display a message
 at the bottom of the panel with this ID.  All FX messages pertaining
 to a request will have the same ID at both the sending and all
 receiving ends.
0When you select the "enter a request' option (option 1) you will
 receive the following panel:

  17|        COMMAND:            (L for node list or S to submit request)   |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
0 Line  1. The "name" of the system that will record your transmission
           request.
  Line  2. Your user id.
  Line  3. Time.
  Line  4. Name of data set to be transmitted or the name of the data set
           that contains the member to be transmitted.  Enter the fully
           qualified data set name without quotes.  FX will verify that
           you have at least READ level access to the data set before
           before accepting the request.   This is a required field.
  Line  5. Name of member to be transmitted.  If this is left blank, FX
           assumes you want to transmit the entire data set.
  Line  8. New data set name.  If this is left blank, the original data
           set name (the name on line 4) will be used.
  Line  9. New member name.  If this is left blank, the original member
           name (the name on line 5) will be used.
  Line 11. If set to "NO" or allowed to default, FX will not replace the
           data set or member if it already exists.  If set to "YES",
           the data set or member will be replaced if they exist.
  Line 13. If set to "NO" or allowed to default, FX will not transmit
           the aliases associated with a PDS member.  This is only valid
           if a member name is given, and if replace is "NO".
  Line 17. Enter "L" to view the destinations (node list), enter "S" when
           all your data has been entered to submit the request to FX.

   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
0 The user that entered the request, and the system you are using are
  displayed in the heading.
  Line  4. Date and time the request was entered.
  Line  5. Date and time the restore response was received from the last
           (or only) destination.
  Line  6. Over-all status.
  Line  7. Request ID.  The request ID is assigned by FX when the request
           is entered.  ssssssss is the network APPLID of the FX node
           where the request was entered, nnnnnnn is a sequential number,
           jjjjjjjj is the job name (when the request is entered via a
           batch job).
  Line  8. Transmitting FX node name.
  Line  9. Original data set name.
  Line 10. Original member name (blank if full data set transmission).
  Line 11. Data set name at the destination(s).  If blank the original
           data set name is used.
  Line 12. New member name.  If blank the original member name is used.
  Line 13. Replace flag (yes or no).
  Line 14. Aliases flag (yes or no).
  Line 17. Commands.  Enter a "C" to cancel the request.  Cancelling a
           request does not cause FX to remove the request from its
           master file.  Cancelling the request stops FX from doing any
           further processing of a request, any activity already under
           way is allowed to complete.  Enter a "O" to view the output
           of the utility FX used to dump or restore the data.  If a
           dump or restore error occurs, the messages from the utility
           should give the reason.  Enter an "L" to view the destination
           or node list (the node list display is described later in this
           guide).
-          DESTINATION (NODE LIST) DISPLAY
 The node list display panel looks like:

0FX allows for multiple destinations per request.  The maximum number
 allowed for a request is an install option.  If more nodes are in the
 list (on a request entry, a blank line will be displayed for the maximum
 number of nodes), the scroll PF keys will move the display up or down.
 When entering a request the node name field is unprotected so you can
 enter your destinations.  The same node name may not be given more than
 once.  All destinations must be pre-defined to FX in its start-up
 parameters.  Aliases can be defined for destinations so you don't have
 to know or remember VTAM LU names, ask your FX system administrator for
 a list of valid names.  When querying a request, all fields are
 protected (you cannot over-type them).  The number of lines displayed
 will be limited to the number of nodes entered when the request was
 entered.  The status to each node will be displayed.  Each destination
 will respond with the success or failure to restore the data.  When
 the last destination has responded (successful or not), FX considers
 the request complete (the over-all status will be set to complete).
