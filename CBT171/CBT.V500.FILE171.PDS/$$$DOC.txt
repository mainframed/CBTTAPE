 Packages SUTL and SMFSPLIT were added later.

 There are three packages in this file currently (05/16/91).  These
 are DITTO, DISASM, and TAPEMAP.  DITTO is a public-domain program
 which runs even under MVS/ESA, and which does many of the usual
 functions expected of a program of that name.  TAPEMAP is a version
 of the program on File 299 of the CBT Tape, but which is broken into
 separate CSECTs instead of being "spaghetti-coded", as is the former
 program.  DISASM is a rework of the disassembler of File 217, also
 broken into CSECTs, but incorporating various improvements, such as
 the ability to use REAL MACROS for the purpose of name mapping.

 This file consists of seven IEBUPDTE or "PDSLOAD" unloaded PDS'es
 which are as individual members in this file.  Each of these members
 must be expanded into a separate PDS.  Before the expansion, all
 "><" strings in columns 1-2 of the source must be changed to "./"
 first.  If PDSLOAD is being used for the expansion (its load module
 is on File 035 of the CBT Tape), ISPF statistics will be stowed
 with the expansion.

 Good luck.
