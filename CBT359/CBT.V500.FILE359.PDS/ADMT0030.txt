+  The%Image Symbol Editor+(ISE) is a part of the%Presentation Graphics%
%  Feature+(PGF), which is an optional feature of the Graphical Data Display
   Manager (GDDM) program product.  The Image Symbol Editor is a program that
   you can use at a display station to create new symbols, and change existing
   ones.  Image symbols are used by GDDM as typefaces, special symbols (such
   as company logos), shading patterns, or chart marker symbols.  A detailed
   discussion of the ISE can be found in the following IBM publication:

     % "Graphical Data Display Manager - Presentation Graphics Feature,
              Image Symbol Editor User's Guide" - SC33-0153+

   The above manual includes a number of tutorial sessions that show you how
   to use the ISE.  You will find that the best way to learn about the ISE
   is to use it.  In addition tutorial panels are incorporated within the ISE
   and can be displayed by depressing the HELP (PF1/PF13) program function
   key.
