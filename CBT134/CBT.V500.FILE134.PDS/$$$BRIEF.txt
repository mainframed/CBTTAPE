--- --------
    JES2     - REPORT ABEND CODE OR HIGHEST COND CODE IN TSO NOTIFY.
    MPF      - ISSUE MESSAGE TO CULPRIT TSO USER WHEN WAITING FOR D/S.
    SDSF     - SHOW OUTPUT/NJE QUEUES THAT NORMALLY GET FORGOTTEN.
    SMF      - COLLECT AND LOG "EXCP" COUNTS FOR JES FILES.
               THIS IS FOR JES2 AND JES3 BSAM AND QSAM.
               THE RESULT IS THAT NULL COUNTERS IN LSQA AND SMF RECORDS
               ARE NOW "MAINTAINED" AND CAN HAVE NON-ZERO VALUES.
               IF YOU WANT, A SMALL CHANGE CAN MAINTAIN THE COUNTS
               SO YOUR MONITORS CAN DISPLAY THEM WHILE A JOB IS RUNNING,
               BUT THEN HAVE ONLY ZERO VALUES LOGGED TO SMF.
    TEST     - STOP TSO TEST LIST I STOPPING AT BAD OPCODE.
               AT TSO/E BASE FMID LEVEL.
    TESTLSTI - STOP TSO TEST LIST I STOPPING AT BAD OPCODE.
               SAME AS ABOVE BUT IN ITS OWN MEMBER.
               UPDATED FOR UY74160.
               ________________________________________________________

               DEFAULT CODE.
    IEFUJV   - SMF EXIT TO VERIFY JOB ACCOUNT CODE FORMAT ON JOB CARD,
               AND SUPPLY ZERO CODE IF MISSING.  HENCE, CAN USE

    IEFU83   - SMF EXIT TO SHOW I/O DETAILS ON JOB'S SYSOUT.
               COMES WITH MPF EXITS TO DISTRIBUTE MESSAGES CORRECTLY.
    IKJEFF10 - TSO SUBMIT EXIT IN ITS OWN MEMBER.  STOLEN FROM CBT
               FILE 369.  MODIFIED FOR ISPF/PDF 3.4 OFFSETS AND
               FIXED SO 'PROFILE NOWTPMSG' DOES NOT CAUSE WACKY
               BEHAVIOUR.  ITS FUNCTION IS TO PLACE THE SOURCE DATA
               SET NAME OF THE JCL BEING SUBMITTED IN A JCL COMMENT
               AFTER THE JOB CARD IF 'PROFILE WTPMSG' IS ACTIVE.
               OFFSETS FOR ISPF/PDF 3.2 AND 2.3 CAN BE DERIVED FROM
               THE LEADING COMMENTS.
    IKJEFF53 - TSO STATUS/OUTPUT/CANCEL EXIT IN ITS OWN MEMBER.
               THIS IS THE IPO VERSION WITH A SMALL BUT
               PHILOSOPHICALLY SOUND MODIFICATION.

               INTO TSO SESSION JOB CARD PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD,
               AND ALLOW MULTIPLE CONCURRENT SESSIONS PER TSO USERID.
