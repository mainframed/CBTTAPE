+
+ %Encrypt+and%Decrypt options
+
+   The%Encrypt+option encodes the data in a sequential data set or
+  a PDS member. The key used in encrypting the data is placed in the
+ %password+field of the panel. This key must be no more than four
+  characters in length. The same key must be used in%decrypting+the data
+  otherwise an error message will be generated. The process cannot be
+  interrupted and will continue regardless (after issuing a warning message)
+  with the encryption/decryption. The%password+field is not stored in the
+  profile data set (for obvious reasons) and must be reentered when option
+ %"U"+is reinvoked, but will remain (in non-display format) in use until
+  one exits from the panel. If a PDS member is encrypted, it is done in place
+  and will not generate a GAS member, a process which is also more secure.
+  If the data is corrupted or the key is forgotten, then%G.Price+might be
+  able to help you salvage the data or the lost key.
+   %N.B.+Although the program has been tested and is almost infallible,
+         no guarantees are given or implied.
