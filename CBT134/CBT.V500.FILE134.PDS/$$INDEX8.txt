$$$BRIEF - UPDATED FOR THIS SHIPMENT.

$SP4MODS - (NEW.)  SAME AS $SP3MODS BUT UPDATED FOR LATER RELEASES OF
           BCP, TSO/E, SDSF ETC.  REMEMBER, THIS IS IN
           PDSLOAD/IEBUPDTE FORMAT, SO USE JCL LIKE -
           //.JOBCARD JOB <JOB CARD PARAMETERS>
           //STEP1   EXEC PGM=PDSLOAD,PARM='UPDTE(><)'
           //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=CBT.FILE035.PDS,DISP=SHR
           //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
           //SYSUT1   DD  DSN=CBT.FILE134.PDS($SP4MODS),DISP=SHR
           //SYSUT2   DD  DSN=USERID.$SP4MODS.DATA,DISP=(NEW,CATLG),
           //             UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(10,10,10))

ABEND    - ANOTHER COUPLE OF HUNDRED LINES ADDED, MAINLY FOR
           OPEN/CLOSE/END-OF-VOLUME ABENDS UP TO SP4 LEVEL.

COMPARE  - (NEW.)  THE COMPARE COMMAND PROCESSOR FROM CBT FILE 296.
           NOTHING MUCH CHANGED BUT INCLUDED HERE FOR COMPLETENESS.
           NOTE THAT THE LOAD MODULE IS RENT,REUS,REFR.

COMPARE# - (NEW.)  MY ATTEMPT AT MAKING THE CAPABILITIES OF
           COMPARE AND COMPAREB CLEAR.  (TSO HELP FOR COMPARE.)

COMPAREB - (NEW.)  THE COMPAREB UTILITY FROM YALE.  COPIED FROM
           CBT FILE 296 AND CHANGED TO HANDLE LRECL LESS THAN 80
           CORRECTLY.  (THIS FIX WAS PROMPTED BY USER COMPLAINTS.)
           ALSO, FORCE 'FULL' IF LRECL IS NOT GREATER THAN 8.
           ALSO ALSO, HANDLE ANY LRECL AND RECORD FORMAT!!!
           NOTE THAT IT IS NOT REENTRANT.

DIVER    - OWING TO PUBLIC DEMAND THE SOURCE OF DIVER IS NOW
           INCLUDED.  IT WAS STEVE BEER'S FIRST ASSEMBLER PROGRAM
           SO PLEASE EXCUSE ANY GLICHES IN CODING PRACTICES.
           (MIND YOU, IT LOOKS ALRIGHT TO ME.)  THE PREVIOUSLY
           SHIPPED OBJECT DECK HAS BEEN RENAMED TO DIVEROBJ.

REVIEW   - RELEASE 12.  CHECK THE CHANGE LOG IN THE LEADING SOURCE
           COMMENTS.  REVIEW OF ICF VSAM IS NOW INDEPENDENT OF
           "UADS" UNITNAME.  USER COMPLAINT HAS PROMPTED "FASTPATH"
           SUPPRESSION FOR "SMALL" RECFM=FB FILES - AGAIN CHECK THE
           SOURCE COMMENTS (AFTER LABEL OBTX) FOR FULL DETAILS.
           'FINDSMF'/'FS' CAN NOW RESTRICT RECORD TYPES DOWN TO
           SUBTYPE LEVEL.  SUBTYPE MUST BE THE STANDARD IBM SMF
           SUBTYPE, AND THIS MUST BE INDICATED IN THE RECORD'S
           SMF FLAG BYTE - SEE THE HELP FOR 'FINDSMF'.

REVIEW#  - UPDATED WITH CHANGES FOR 'FINDSMF'/'FS'.  (REVIEW TSO HELP.)

REVIEW@  - GENERAL DOCO UPDATED FOR RELEASE 12.  ISSUE
           F | 1
           UNDER BROWSE (OR REVIEW) TO LOCATE UPDATES.

REVSMF   - SOME MINOR FIXES AND INTERNALLY REORGANIZED.
           THE REORGANIZATION MEANS THAT THERE IS ONE BASE REGISTER
           FOR COMMON MAINLINE AND SUBROUTINE CODE, AND ANOTHER FOR
           THE RECORD-TYPE-BEING-PROCESSED DEPENDENT CODE.  THIS
           MEANS THAT EACH RECORD TYPE CAN HAVE AT LEAST 4K OF CODE
           SUPPORTED AUTOMATICALLY.

SHOWDS   - ALLOW 'DIR' OPERAND TO WORK IN THE GENERAL CASE.

UIDSTR   - TSO COMMAND FOR THE CLIST ENVIRONMENT ONLY.
           SUPPLIED BY ROBBERT VAN RIEL OF ANZ BANK.
           IT GETS THE ACF2 UID STRING AND PLACES IT IN THE
           &UIDSTR CLIST VARIABLE.  IT CAN BE USED IN A CLIST TO
           DETERMINE THE TSO USER'S "GROUP".  FOR EXAMPLE:
         UIDSTR                            /* GET ACF2 USERID STRING */
         SET GROUP = &SUBSTR(1:8,&UIDSTR)  /* GET USER'S ACF2 GROUP  */
         SET GROUP = &GROUP                /* REMOVE TRAILING BLANKS */
