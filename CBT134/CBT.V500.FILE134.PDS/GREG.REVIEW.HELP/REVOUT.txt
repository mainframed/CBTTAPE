*                    TSO HELP FOR 'REVOUT' RELEASE 48.3     AUGUST 2018
)F Function -
  The REVOUT command gives access to REVIEW's job status display.
  REVOUT uses the TSO FIB commands to display the status of jobs
  and display the contents of held SYSOUT.

  REVOUT facilities may also be accessed from RFE option 3.8.

  Jobs are listed in the order returned by the STATUS TSO command.
  The user can process listed jobs by entering selection codes.
  REVOUT will use the OUTPUT and CANCEL TSO commands to carry out
  the requested action(s).

  REVOUT requires that the REVOUTJB CLIST is installed for implicit
  command execution.

  REVIEW is used to browse held SYSOUT.  Browsed job output may be
  colored by REVIEW depending on message identifier recognition
  and Assembler listing syntax highlighting.

  Under MVS 3.8 systems running JES2, the STATUS command is not used
  but rather the JES2 checkpoint and SPOOL data sets are dynamically
  allocated and read directly.

  (Note this point for security administration purposes.)

  In this MVS 3.8 with JES2 case, 'jobname' may also be a job name
  prefix, where the supplied job name characters are matched and
  all subsequent characters are wildcarded.  A single asterisk may
  be specified to select all jobs.  Also, spooled output from jobs
  without held SYSOUT is accessed by directly reading the SPOOL.
  Held SYSOUT is also accessed directly from the SPOOL unless the
  FIB ON setting is active.
)X Syntax -
         REVOUT  'jobname'

  Required - None.

  Defaults - Default STATUS command search when no operand is used.

  Aliases  - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'jobname' - The job name argument passed to the STATUS TSO command.

  Note that for MVS 3.8 systems running JES2, this operand can also
  be a job name prefix, where the supplied job name characters are
  matched and all subsequent characters are wildcarded.  A single
  asterisk may be specified to select all jobs.

              It should not be 'NEXT', 'PREV' or 'LIST'.
=START=SPLIT
)F Function -
  The START subcommand requests that a new parallel session is
  to be initiated and given control.  The new session will be under
  the RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will
  NOT be started if it would cause the maximum logical session
  limit to be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary
  option menu is shown.
)X Syntax -
     START  'option'

 Alias    - SPLIT

=SWAP
)F Function -
  The SWAP subcommand specifies which parallel REVIEW session is to
  become the current session.  It can also list the started REVIEW
  sessions which are eligible to become the current session.  A
  parallel REVIEW session is created when the REVIEW TSO subcommand
  (not the ISPF TSO subcommand) is used to create a recursive REVIEW
  session.  The nesting order of these sessions can be changed by
  SWAP.
)X Syntax -
     SWAP    LIST  /  NEXT  /  PREV  /  #  /  'name'

            session-id order.
))#       - Specifies the decimal number of the target session
            that is to be swapped with the current session.
            'SWAP 0' is a no-operation.
=TSO=TSS
)F Function -
  The TSO subcommand specifies a TSO command processor to be invoked
  from the REVIEW processor.  Commands generating an implicit EXEC
  such as SYSPROC member names and commands immediately prefixed by
  a percent sign (%) are supported.
)X Syntax -
     TSO  'command' 'operands'

 Alias    - TSS
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'command'
)O Operands -
)P 'command'  - Specifies a TSO command to be executed.

=LIST=L=LOC=LOCATE
)F Function -
  The LIST subcommand repositions the screen to the relative line
  number entered.
)X Syntax -
     LIST 'lineno'

 Aliases  - L, LOC, LOCATE
 Defaults - None.
 Required - lineno
)O Operands -
)P 'lineno' -  Specifies the relative line number to which the screen
               is to be positioned.
=FIB
)F Function -
  The FIB command only has any effect in an MVS 3.8 JES2 environment.
  It is not present in the z/OS version of REVOUT.  The FIB setting
  controls whether the TSO OUTPUT command will be used to retrieve
  held SYSOUT or direct I/O to the SPOOL is used instead.  The FIB
  setting is not saved in the user's profile because it is assumed
  that everyone would prefer the default setting of FIB OFF.
)X Syntax -
     FIB    ON  /  OFF  /  ?

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON  - The OUTPUT FIB command will be used to retrieve held SYSOUT.
))OFF - The OUTPUT FIB command will not be invoked.
))?   - Display the current setting without changing it.
=INPUT
)F Function -
  The INPUT command only has any effect in an MVS 3.8 JES2 environ-
  ment.  It is not present in the z/OS version of REVOUT.  The INPUT
  setting controls whether the SPOOL data sets selected for browsing
  are restricted to SYSOUT data sets or not.
)X Syntax -
     INPUT    ON  /  OFF  /  ?

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON  - Non-SYSOUT SPOOL data sets will be browsed as well as SYSOUT.
))OFF - Only SYSOUT data sets will be selected for browsing.
))?   - Display the current setting without changing it.
=STATUS=ST
)F Function -
  The STATUS subcommand specifies the job name to search for.
)X Syntax -
     STATUS 'jobname'

 Alias    - ST
 Defaults - Default STATUS TSO command search when no operand is used.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'jobname' - The job name argument passed to the STATUS TSO command.

  Under MVS 3.8 systems running JES2, the STATUS command is not used
  but rather the JES2 checkpoint and SPOOL data sets are dynamically
  allocated and read directly.

  (Note this point for security administration purposes.)

  In this MVS 3.8 with JES2 case, 'jobname' may also be a job name
  prefix, where the supplied job name characters are matched and
  all subsequent characters are wildcarded.  A single asterisk may
  be specified to select all jobs.  Also, spooled output from jobs
  without held SYSOUT is accessed by directly reading the SPOOL.
=CANCEL=CAN
)F Function -
  The CANCEL subcommand terminates the REVOUT command.  Further,
  the profile data is marked as unchanged so any profile updates
  such as new PFK assignments will be discarded.
)X Syntax -
     CANCEL

 Alias    - CAN
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=END
)F Function -
  The END subcommand terminates the REVOUT command.  If REVOUT is
  invoked as RFE option 3.8, then END will exit back to the previous
  menu.
)X Syntax -
     END

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=EXIT=RETURN==X
)F Function -
  The EXIT subcommand terminates the REVOUT command.  If REVOUT is
  invoked as RFE option 3.8, then =X will terminate the logical
  screen session.
)X Syntax -
     EXIT

 Aliases  - RETURN, =X
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
