*                    TSO HELP FOR 'REVLEV' RELEASE 48.5    JANUARY 2019
)F Function -
  REVLEV is a processing option of RFE (REVIEW Front End) with the
  main function of presenting a list of data sets which then allows
  the easy selection of data sets for processing by utility functions.

  The initial panel allows the specification of the data set name
  prefix and a volume serial number.

  If the volume serial number field is left blank then the catalog
  is used as the source of data set names to list.

  If a volume serial number is supplied the data sets on that volume
  are listed, subject to filtering by the specified data set name
  prefix.  If no data set name prefix is specified then all data sets
  on the volume are listed.

  When a data set name list is presented, each detail line has a
  single character selection code input field, the name of the data
  set, and several attributes of the data set.

  Initially the list is sorted by data set name.  Any of the display
  columns can be used to sort the list, either in ascending or
  descending order.  Each sortable attribute has a default sort
  order.  For example, SORT NAME has a default sort order of
  ascending, as does SORT VOLUME, but SORT AL and SORT US have a
  default sort order of descending.

  The input selection code field can be used to trigger an action
  upon the data set listed on that display line.


  Volume-specific extras
  ======================

  When a volume serial number is supplied, the resultant list of
  data sets is read from the Volume Table Of Contents (VTOC) of
  that volume.  RFE also issues a Sense-Id I/O operation to the
  volume and the type of device and control unit returned by that
  operation are shown at the top left corner of the screen.

  For terminals with suitable graphics facilities, and when the
  geometry of the disk volume suits, a disk space usage plot will
  be displayed after the end of the data set list.  Each track is
  represented by a single 3270 pixel.  The top row of pixels
  represents track or head 0 of each cylinder, the second pixel
  row represents track or head 1 of each cylinder, and so on.
  The left-most column of pixels in the plot represents cylinder 0.

  The colors used in the volume space map plot are:

  White     - The volume label (track 0) and space described by
              the format-4 DSCB (which is the VTOC).

  Green     - Space described by a format-1 DSCB for non-VSAM data
              sets which are not CVOLs, or DSORG=DA or DSORG=IS.

  Pink      - Space described by a format-1 DSCB for non-VSAM data
              sets which are CVOLs, or DSORG=DA or DSORG=IS.

  Turquoise - Space described by a format-1 DSCB for VSAM data sets.

  Yellow    - Space described by a format-3 DSCB.  Such space will
              include secondary extents from extent 4 onwards.  The
              first 3 extents of a data set are described by a
              format-1 DSCB.

  Blue      - Space described by a format-5 DSCB, which is free space.
              This will only be visible if the VTOC is not indexed.

  Red       - Any space which was plotted more than once.  Such
              space is actually in more than one extent and any
              such space indicates a corrupt VTOC.  Also, if a
              data set name prefix was specified, then all extents
              of all listed data sets will be shown in red.

 ------------------------ SELECTION CODES -----------------------------

 Listed data sets can be processed by the following selection codes:

 A - ALLOCATE LIKE - Allocate a new data set with some attributes
     of the selected data set already primed in the data set
     creation specification panel.

 B - BROWSE - Look at the contents of the data set using the REVIEW
     data set browser.

 C - CATALOG - Create a catalog entry for an uncataloged data set.

 D - DELETE - Delete the data set after a confirmation panel is shown.

  ** NOTE: DISP=(,DELETE) is used to carry out the DELETE function.
     If the data still exists after being dynamically deallocated,
     then the D action is flagged as being unsuccessful, but no
     other feedback is given.  Possible reasons include the data
     set's retention period has not expired, and the data set's
     name is not entirely comprised of valid qualifiers.

 E - EDIT - Update the data set with the REVEDIT editor.

 I - INFORMATION - Display details about the data set including PDS
     directory information.

 L - LISTCAT - Display the catalog entry details as reported by
     the LISTCAT command.

 M - MEMLIST - Display the member list of the PDS or PDSE.

 R - RENAME - Change the name of the selected data set.

 S - SHORT INFORMATION - same as the I selection code except that
     the data set is not opened so PDS directory information will
     not be shown and the last referenced date will not be changed.

 U - UNCATALOG - Delete the catalog entry of the selected data set
     without deleting the actual data set.

 V - VIEW - Look at the contents of the data set using the REVEDIT
     editor in View mode, which means changes cannot be saved.

 Z - COMPRESS - Reclaim unused space in a PDS by a CONDENSE process
     which causes the contents of the PDS to be copied to a holding
     sequential data set (usually called 'userid.CONDENSE'), the PDS
     to be reset to empty, and the contents written back to the PDS
     from the holding data set.

  ** NOTE: If the write-back phase does not complete successfully,
     the holding data set is not deleted.  Its contents can be used
     as input to the REVLPDS program to reconstruct the PDS.  The
     necessary DDs for PGM=REVLPDS are SYSUT1 for the sequential
     input and SYSUT2 for the partitioned output.

 ------------------------ DISPLAY COLUMNS -----------------------------

 Data sets are listed with the following information columns:

 DATA-SET-NAME - The name of the data set or catalog entry.

 VOLUME - The serial number of the first or only volume where
          the data set resides.  This will be followed by a
          plus sign '+' for multi-volume data sets.  When the
          data set list is made of VTOC entries, the volume
          will be followed by a not sign ('¬') when the listed
          data set is not cataloged.

 ALTRK  - The number of tracks allocated to the data set on this
          volume.  For cataloged multi-volume data sets, this is
          the total number of tracks allocated on all volumes.

 USTRK  - The total number of tracks from the start of the data
          set used to hold the data.  This data item is only
          maintained by the system for sequential and PDS
          (excluding PDSE) data sets.

 ORG    - The data set organization.  Possible values are:
            CAT - Formatted OS catalog - known as SYSCTLG or CVOL
            DA  - Direct Access
            DAU - Direct Access Unmovable
            IS  - Indexed Sequential
            PS  - Physical Sequential - DSNTYPE=BASIC
            PSE - Physical Sequential Extended Format - may be
                  striped and/or compressed
            PSL - Physical Sequential Large - can be larger than
                  65536 tracks - DSNTYPE=LARGE
            PSU - Physical Sequential Unmovable
            PO  - Partitioned Organization - DSNTYPE=PDS
            POE - Partitioned Organization Extended - PDSE -
                  DSNTYPE=LIBRARY
            POU - Partitioned Organization Unmovable
            VS  - VSAM
          (DSNTYPE is a z/OS JCL parameter.)

 FRMT   - The record format of the data set.

 %      - The fullness percentage of the data set.  This is only
          meaningful for sequential and PDS (excluding PDSE) data sets.

 XT     - The number of extents of disk space owned by the data set.

 LRECL  - The maximum length of a logical record allowed in the
          data set.

 BLKSZ  - The maximum length of a physical block allowed in the
          data set.

 REFDT  - The date that the data set was last opened, or perhaps
          closed for some versions of the operating system.
          This field will be blank for data sets that have never
          been opened.

 CREDT  - The date that the data set was created.

          An 'R' displayed between the CREDT and EXPDT columns
          indicates that the RACF protection bit has been set
          in data set's VTOC entry.

 EXPDT  - If non-blank, this is the expiration date set in the
          VTOC (not catalog) entry.  Attempting an update before
          this date is passed will cause a WTOR to be issued to
          seek permission from the system operator.  The PURGE
          keyword is needed on the DELETE command to delete data
          sets that have not yet passed their expiration date.

              ## is a 1 or 2 decimal digit number in the range of
              0 to 24 inclusive.  Numbers from 1 to 24 specify a
              particular Program Function Key.  If ## is 0 then
              all 24 PF Keys will be assigned their default values.

 'newpfdata'- Specifies the new subcommand for this PF Key.
=SCRNAME
)F Function -
  The SCRNAME subcommand allows a new name to be assigned to the
  active logical screen.  This name can be used as the operand of
  a SWAP subcommand.  Screen names are displayed by SWAP LIST.

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - name
)O Operands -
)P 'name'   - Specifies the screen name.  It can be up to eight
              characters long.  It cannot be completely numeric.
              It should not be 'NEXT', 'PREV' or 'LIST'.
=START=SPLIT
)F Function -
  The START subcommand requests that a new parallel session is
  to be initiated and given control.  The new session will be under
  the RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will
  NOT be started if it would cause the maximum logical session
  limit to be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary
  option menu is shown.
)X Syntax -
     START  'option'

 Alias    - SPLIT
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.

              will cause the main menu to be shown with the
              'Invalid command' message.
=SWAP
)F Function -
  The SWAP subcommand specifies which parallel REVIEW session is to
  become the current session.  It can also list the started REVIEW
  sessions which are eligible to become the current session.  A
  parallel REVIEW session is created when the REVIEW TSO subcommand
  (not the ISPF TSO subcommand) is used to create a recursive REVIEW
  session.  The nesting order of these sessions can be changed by SWAP.
)X Syntax -
     SWAP   LIST / NEXT / PREV / # / 'name'

            session-id order.
))#       - Specifies the decimal number of the target session
            that is to be swapped with the current session.
            'SWAP 0' is a no-operation.
=TSO=TSS
)F Function -
  The TSO subcommand specifies a TSO command processor to be invoked
  from the REVIEW processor.  Commands generating an implicit EXEC
  such as SYSPROC member names and commands immediately prefixed by
  a percent sign (%) are supported.

     TSO  'command' 'operands'

 Alias    - TSS
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'command'
)O Operands -
)P 'command'  - Specifies a TSO command to be executed.

)P 'operands' - Specifies any desired operands for this TSO command.
=CANCEL=CAN
)F Function -
  The CANCEL subcommand performs the same processing as the END
  subcommand without saving the REVIEW/FSHELP user profile to disk.
  The REVIEW/FSHELP user profile (which contains data display colors,
  scrolling amount and 24 PF Key values) is normally only rewritten to
  disk at the END of a REVIEW session if it has been changed during
  that session.  If a member list has not been displayed in a session
  then the REVIEW session is terminated without saving the user
  profile.  If a member list has been shown it is reshown but the user
  profile is no longer considered to have been altered, even though the
  profile "in-core" still has the changes applied to it.  Changing the
  profile at this stage and exiting will cause all accumulated profile
  changes for the REVIEW session to be saved to disk unless another
  CANCEL is issued.
)X Syntax -
     CANCEL

 Alias    - CAN
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=END
)F Function -
  The END subcommand terminates the REVLEV command.  If REVLEV is
  invoked as RFE option 3.4, then END will exit back to the previous
  menu.
)X Syntax -
     END

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=EXIT=RETURN==X
)F Function -
  The EXIT subcommand terminates the REVLEV command.  If REVLEV is
  invoked as RFE option 3.4, then =X will terminate the logical
  screen session.
)X Syntax -
     EXIT

 Aliases  - RETURN, =X
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=FIND=F
)F Function -
  The FIND subcommand positions the display to a data set which
  contains the search argument string in its name.

  FIND notes:
   1.  A search argument is required.  A single unquoted asterisk
       may be used to specify the same argument as was last used.
   2.  The first operand is always treated as the search argument.
   3.  The entire first operand is treated as the search argument,
       so, in general, do NOT use quotes.
)X Syntax -
     FIND 'string'   FIRST / NEXT / PREV / LAST

 Alias    - F
 Defaults - NEXT
 Required - 'string'
)O Operands -
)P 'string'  - Specifies the string to look for in data set names.
))FIRST   - Search forward from the top of the data set list.
))NEXT    - Search forward from the current location.
))PREV    - Search backward from the current location.
))LAST    - Search backward from the end of the data set list.
=RFIND=IFIND
)F Function -
  The RFIND subcommand repeats the previous FIND operation.
  No operands are allowed.  It is expected that RFIND will be used
  as the default meaning of a PFK such as PF5 or PF17.
  Note: RFIND in the forward direction skips the current top line.
)X Syntax -
     RFIND

 Alias    - IFIND
 Defaults - Same operation, string and direction.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=SEARCH=SRCHFOR
)F   The SEARCH subcommand causes a data entry screen to be presented
  where the parameters of a multi-data set search can be specified.
  The facilities of the REVIEW FIND subcommand are used.  Searched
  data sets are flagged with the $ character to indicate the most
  action performed.  Only data sets where matching data was found
  will be shown in high intensity or white.
)X Syntax -
     SEARCH
 ALIASES  - SRCHFOR
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=RESET=RES
)F Function -

  action error status indicators, and all last-action-performed
  indicators.
)X Syntax -
     RESET

 Alias    - RES
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=TOP
)F   The TOP subcommand requests that the first entry in the data
  set list is show as the first data set listed on the screen.
)X Syntax -
     TOP

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=BOTTOM=BOT
)F   The BOTTOM subcommand requests that the last part of the data
  set list is shown on the screen.  When the list is too long to be
  shown in its entirety, the end-of-list marker line is shown on
  the last line of the screen, and the last data set in the list is
  shown on the second last line of the screen.
)X Syntax -
     BOTTOM

 Alias    - BOT
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
=UP=-
)F Function -
  The UP subcommand moves the screen up the specified number of

  The LEFT subcommand ensures that the left-most display items after
  the data set name are visible.  This is the initial left/right
  display location.  If the screen is sufficiently wide the LEFT and
  RIGHT subcommands may not result in any change to the display.
)X Syntax -
     LEFT

 Aliases  - LEFT, <
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=RIGHT=>
)F Function -
  The RIGHT subcommand ensures that the right-most display items
  are visible.  If the screen is sufficiently wide the LEFT and
  RIGHT subcommands may not result in any change to the display.
)X Syntax -
     RIGHT

 Aliases  - RIGHT, >
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=LIST=L=LOC=LOCATE
)F Function -
  The LIST subcommand repositions the data set list so that the top
  detail display line has the first or only occurrence of the locate
  data.  The locate data specified may be a display line number, or
  non-numeric data which is matched with the sort field.

  Example 1: When a list of more than 29 data sets is shown,
                LOC 30
             will scroll the display to show the thirtieth line first.

  Example 2: When a list of SYS1 data sets is initially shown,
                L SYS1.H
             may scroll the display to show SYS1.HELP first.

  Example 3: After SORT F D is issued for a data set list,
                LIST F
             scrolls the display to show the first data set in the
             list that has fixed-length records.
)X Syntax -
     LIST 'locdata'

 Aliases  - L, LOC, LOCATE
 Defaults - None.
 Required - locdata
)O Operands -
)P 'locdata' - specifes how the top detail display line is to be
               located.  The data can be numeric or non-numeric.

  For numeric data, the operand specifies the line number to be
  positioned as the top visible detail line.  When 0 (zero) is
  specified, the TOP subcommand action is performed.

  For non-numeric data, the operand is deemed to be a string which
  is compared to the start of the sort column contents.  The first
  display line which does not compare low with the operand is
  shown as the top detail display line.
=SORT
)F Function -
  The SORT subcommand causes the displayed data set list to be
  reordered according to the specified criterion.  Underscored
  column headings may be selected as the sorting criterion without
  typing a SORT command by means of cursor placement.

  Cursor-selected sorts will use the default sort order (either
  ascending or descending) for that column.  The first operand must
  always specify the display column to be used as the sort field.  A
  second optional operand may specify one of the two sort orders.

  Every column is a valid sort field, even if the screen is not wide
  enough to show all columns.  When wide screens are not used, the
  number of omitted columns depends on the length of the longest
  data set name listed.
)X Syntax -
     SORT  'sort-field'  'sort-order'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - D (for DATA-SET-NAME)
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'sort-field' - The name of the display column.
    Only the first character of the operand is examined.
      Valid sort field names are:
  A - default sort order D - allocated number of tracks
  B - default sort order A - physical block size
  C - default sort order D - creation date
  D - default sort order A - data set name - has an alias of N
  E - default sort order D - expiration date
  F - default sort order A - record format
  L - default sort order A - logical record length
  O - default sort order A - organization
  P - default sort order D - percent used - has an alias of %
  R - default sort order D - last-referenced date
  U - default sort order D - used number of tracks
  V - default sort order A - volume serial number
  X - default sort order D - number of extents
)P 'sort-order' - The sort order which is either A or D.
    Only the first character of the operand is examined.
      Valid sort orders are:
  A - ascending
  D - descending
=MEMBER=MEM
)F Function -
  The MEMBER subcommand causes partitioned data sets in the list to
  be searched for members with names matching the mask specified as
  the only operand.

  Data sets with matching member names are highlighted in white or
  high intensity, while other data sets are unhighlighted.

  The operation begins with a RESET action, so any residual last
  command indicators are cleared.

  All PDS and PDSE data sets in the list are eligible, and are given
  a last command indicator of an asterisk, which is shown in red if
  the data set could not be successfully accessed.  Non-partitioned
  data sets are not affected by this command.

  Internally, the processing of a PDS or PDSE is terminated when the
  first match is found, or the end of the directory is reached.

  The command can process requests for a specific member, or for a
  generic match.

 Examples -
  MEM *ABC*  - look for member names containing the string 'ABC'.
  MEM ABC*   - look for member names starting with 'ABC'.
  MEM *ABC   - look for member names ending with 'ABC'.
  MEM %ABC*  - look for member names with 'ABC' as the second through
               fourth characters.
  MEM %ABC%* - look for member names with 'ABC' as the second through
               fourth characters which are at least 5 characters long.
  MEM A*BC   - this will match, for example, ABC, AABC, ABBC and AXBC.
)X Syntax -
     MEMBER  'member-name-mask'

 Aliases  - MEM
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'member-name-mask'
)O Operands -
)P 'member-name-mask' - a mask to filter member names.  A single
    string of up to 8 non-blank characters must be specified.
    Alphabetics will be upper-cased.  Generic masking characters
    are an asterisk to match zero or more non-blanks, and a percent
    sign to match any single non-blank character.

    Note that any occurrence of an asterisk-asterisk ('**') or an
    asterisk-percent ('*%') in the mask will be rejected as invalid.
