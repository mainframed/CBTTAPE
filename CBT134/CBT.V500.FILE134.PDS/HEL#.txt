)F Function -
  The FSHELP command displays a HELP member on a 3270 terminal
  in full screen mode.

  In the field labelled MEMBER==> _______, FSHELP displays the current
  HELP member; if the cursor is positioned to this field and a command
  name is entered, FSHELP will display that new member's HELP data.

  In the field labelled SUBCOMMAND==> _______, FSHELP displays the
  current subcommand of the HELP command; if the cursor is positioned
  to this field and a name is entered, FSHELP will display the member's
  HELP data for the entered subcommand.

  The field labelled INPUT===> _______ is the primary input field for
  FSHELP; any supported subcommand may be entered.

  In the field labelled SCROLL ===> __, FSHELP displays the default
  forward and backward scroll amount; if the cursor is positioned to
  this field and an amount is entered, that quantity will become the
  new default scroll amount.

  FIND notes:
   1.  A search argument is required.  A single unquoted asterisk
       may be used to specify the same argument as was last used.
   2.  The first operand is always treated as the search argument.
   3.  The search argument determines whether the search is case
       sensitive, case insensitive or for a picture string, or
       for a string of hexdecimal digits byte-aligned with two
       digits per data byte.
   4.  Quotation marks are required whenever the string type needs
       to be specified.
   5.  Quotation marks are optional for the default string type
       unless the string contains one or more blank characters.
   6.  Operands specifying various keywords and/or column numbers
       may be supplied in any order after the search argument.
   7.  Searches for picture strings are not allowed in ASCII mode.
   8.  If currently in ASCII mode a text or character string specifed
       in the command will be translated to ASCII.
   9.  The 'REST' and 'ALL' operands causes lines failing the match
       criteria to be excluded from view.  No place marker lines for
       this exclusion are shown.  This exclusion is cancelled by
       other FIND/FINDNOT commands, and by 'UP' (including 'UP
       MAX'), 'LIST', 'BOTTOM' and 'RESET'.  It is NOT cancelled by
       'DOWN' or 'TOP', by 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' scrolling or by
       formatting subcommands.

              Quoted strings may have the string type indicated
              before the leading quote or after the trailing quote.
              String types are:

              C - Character for case sensitive search.

              T - Text for case insensitive search.

              X - Hexadecimal digits (byte-aligned and two to a byte).

              P - Picture data where special mask characters represent
                  various categories of data.  Valid picture masks are:
                     ¼ - any non-blank character.
                     $ - any special character.
                     = - any character.
                     # - any decimal numeric character.

                     . - any non-displayable character.
                  Non-mask characters represent themselves, with
                  matching of specific alphabetics being case
                  insensitive.

              Unquoted strings and strings without a string type
              specified are treated as character (type C) strings,
              which requests a case insensitive search.

=FULL
)F Function -
  The FULL subcommand specifies whether character data is displayed
  using full EBCDIC translation or only standard 3270 keyboard
  characters.  If turned on then only code-points that usually cause
  screen errors are deemed to be undisplayable.  If turned off then
  all characters not on a "standard" keyboard are deemed to be
  undisplayable.  (In character mode, undisplayable bytes are
  represented by a period ('.').)  Terminals with APL support may
  have normally unprintable characters displayed from the APL
  character set instead when in 'FULL OFF' mode, equivalent to one of
  the 3278A or the 3278T terminal display modes of ISPF, depending
  on the value set by the DISPLAY subcommand.
)X Syntax -
     FULL ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - opposite mode
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON       - Specifies that all code points X'40' to X'FE' and some

             characters are displayable.
=DISPLAY=DISP
)F Function -
  The DISPLAY subcommand specifies whether character data shown
  in FULL OFF mode is TEXT EBCDIC (as per TN and T11 print trains)
  or not.  This subcommand can be used to improve the readability
  of the data being REVIEWed.  The current setting is shown in the
  message area of the top screen line after the KEYS subcommand is
  issued.  The DISPLAY setting is saved in the user profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     DISPLAY A / T

 Alias    - DISP
 Defaults - opposite mode
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))A        - Specifies that data code points are to be displayed
             from the standard character set if keyboard characters,
             or possibly from the graphic (APL) character set if not
             keyboard characters.  The graphic character set is not
             available on some terminals.  This mode is similar to
             the ISPF 3278A display mode.
))T        - Specifies that the "text" character set (similar to the
             TN and T11 print trains) is to be used for character
             code point interpretation.  Characters from the primary
             (standard) and alternate (graphic/APL) character sets
             may be used as appropriate in order to assist in data
             representation.  This mode is similar to the ISPF 3278T
             display mode, and is helpful in reading syntax diagrams.
=KEYS=?
)F Function -
  The KEYS subcommand displays the current Program Function Key
  values.  Each PF Key (1 to 24) has a default value which may
  be changed with the PFK command.
)X Syntax -
     KEYS

 Alias    - ?
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=RECALL
)F Function -
  The RECALL subcommand causes previously typed-in commands to be
  displayed in the primary input area where they may be changed if
  required and then reissued.  Note that single character input strings
  and text implied by PFK usage are not recallable.  The first command
  recalled is the most recently typed in command.  Consecutive RECALL
  commands cause increasingly older commands to be recalled.
)X Syntax -
     RECALL

 Alias    - The DUP character (X'1C').
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=PFK
)F Function -
  The PFK subcommand changes PFK definitions for the duration of
  the FSHELP session; to change a PFK, a subcommand such as
  'PFK6 RIGHT 1'  is entered to change PFK6 to 'RIGHT 1'.

  By default, the PF KEYS are defined as the following:
              PFK1  - HEL     PFK2  - SPLIT      PFK3  - END
              PFK4  - TSO     PFK5  - RFIND      PFK6  - RCHANGE
              PFK7  - UP      PFK8  - DOWN       PFK9  - SWAP NEXT
              PFK10 - LEFT    PFK11 - RIGHT      PFK12 - RECALL
              PFK13 - TOP     PFK14 - BOTTOM     PFK15 - END
              PFK16 - SMF     PFK17 - RFIND      PFK18 - EREP
              PFK19 - UP      PFK20 - DOWN       PFK21 - HEX
              PFK22 - ASCII   PFK23 - TSO REV    PFK24 - RECALL

  Changes to the PFK assignments may be saved in the profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     PFK## 'newpfdata'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - nn and 'newpfdata'
)O Operands -
)P  ##      - Specifies the PF Key to be modified.
              ## is a 1 or 2 decimal digit number in the range of
              0 to 24 inclusive.  Numbers from 1 to 24 specify a
              particular Program Function Key.  If ## is 0 then
              all 24 PF Keys will be assigned their default values.

 'newpfdata'- Specifies the new subcommand for this PF Key.
=HEX
)F Function -
  The HEX subcommand specifies the display mode (character or
  hexadecimal) for data.  If HEX is entered without operands,
  the current HEX mode is switched to the opposite HEX mode.

  The normal HEX ON display shows each data byte as two
  hexadecimal digits.  In this format, the maximum number of data
  bytes shown on each line is half that of the HEX OFF display.

  The formatting of the HEX ON display can be modified by
  using the HEXC command.
)X Syntax -
     HEX  ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON       - Specifies that data should be displayed in HEX mode.
))OFF      - Specifies that data should be displayed in character mode.
=HEXC
)F Function -
  The HEXC subcommand can be used to modify the HEX ON display.
  The HEXC setting only affects the display of the data when HEX ON
  is active.

  When HEXC is OFF, HEX ON shows the usual two hexadecimal digits
  for each data byte.  This can lead to a crowded screen which is
  difficult to read.

  When HEXC is ON, the HEX ON display is modified to show bytes
  which correspond to keyboard characters as a blank followed by the
  character itself.  Further, nulls are shown as two underscores
  instead of 00.  (An underscore is shown as a single underscore.)

  HEXC can therefore provide improved readability of the data
  and help the user find non-zero data while still providing a
  unique rendering for each of the 256 possible code points.
)X Syntax -
     HEXC  ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON       - Specifies that HEX ON shows two hexadecimal digits for
             each data byte except for keyboard characters and nulls.
))OFF      - Specifies that HEX ON always shows two hexadecimal digits
             for each data byte.
=HEXR
)F Function -
  The HEXR subcommand can be used to display the data in an alternate
  hexadecimal format.  The advantage of the HEXR display over the
  normal HEX display is that the screen is less crowded and the
  character data can be viewed simultaneously.

  The maximum number of data bytes that can be shown by HEXR on each
  line is one quarter of the screen width.  The left-most quarter of
  each line shows the data in character mode.  The other three
  quarters of the line show each byte as two hexadecimal digits with
  a space between each pair of digits.

  Further, to assist with locating non-zero and non-blank data, nulls
  are shown as two periods instead of 00, and blanks are shown as two
  underscores instead of 40.

  Data matched by a FIND command will highlight both the character
  and the hexadecimal parts of the display.  The cursor may be placed
  in either part of the display to control cursor-specified scrolling.

  The name of HEXR comes from "HEX on the right".
)X Syntax -
     HEXR  ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON       - Activates the HEXR display mode.
))OFF      - Deactivates the HEXR display mode.
=HEXX
)F Function -
  The HEXX subcommand provides and extended hexadecimal display
  over the normal HEX display format.  The extension is that each
  data byte is shown as it would be in character mode, followed
  immediately by its hexadecimal code point value, followed by a
  blank to make obvious the character-hexadecimal pairing.

  As a result of this format, the maximum number of data bytes
  which can be shown on a screen line is one quarter of the screen
  width.
)X Syntax -
     HEXX  ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON       - Activates the HEXX display mode.
))OFF      - Deactivates the HEXX display mode.
=COLOR=COLOUR
)F Function -
  The COLOR subcommand specifies whether or not data is to be
  displayed using 3270 extended highlighting and extended color,
  and which color is to be used for actual data display.  Colors
  for character mode and hexadecimal mode may be independently
  selected.  This command may cause errors on some terminals
  depending on terminal type and network definitions.  If no
  operands are entered then the color mode is switched to the
  opposite mode.

  The data display colors may be saved in the profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     COLOR  ON / OFF / #

 Alias    - COLOUR
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON      - Specifies that 3270 data stream extensions may be used.
            This may be rejected if the terminal is known to not
            support color or extended highlighting.
))OFF     - Specifies that 3270 data stream extensions may not be used.
))#       - Specifies the color to be used for actual data.
            If specified while in character mode then this color is
            used in character mode.  If specified while in hexadecimal
            mode then this color is used in hexadecimal mode.
            # must be a single hexadecimal digit and may be rejected
            if it is known that the color is not supported by the
            terminal.  The possible colors and their codes are:
               1 - Blue                9 - Deep blue
               2 - Red                 A - Orange
               3 - Pink                B - Purple
               4 - Green               C - Pale green
               5 - Turquoise           D - Pale turquoise
               6 - Yellow              E - Grey
               7 - Neutral             F - White
                  (Codes 0 and 8 (black) are not allowed.)
                  (Codes 9 to F are only for 16-color terminals.)
=SCRNAME
)F Function -
  The SCRNAME subcommand allows a new name to be assigned to the
  active logical screen.  This name can be used as the operand of
  a SWAP subcommand.  Screen names are displayed by SWAP LIST.
)X Syntax -
     SCRNAME 'name'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - name
)O Operands -
)P 'name'   - Specifies the screen name.  It can be up to eight
              characters long.  It cannot be completely numeric.
              It should not be 'NEXT', 'PREV' or 'LIST'.
=SPLIT
)F Function -
  The SPLIT subcommand requests that a new parallel session is to be
  initiated and given control.  The new session will be under the
  RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will NOT
  be started if it would cause the maximum logical session limit to
  be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary option
  menu is shown.
)X Syntax -
     SPLIT  'option'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'option' - any valid RFE main menu option.  An invalid option
              will cause the main menu to be shown with the
              'Invalid command' message.
=SWAP
)F Function -
  The SWAP subcommand specifies which parallel REVIEW session
  is to become the current session.  It can also list the started
  REVIEW sessions which are eligible to become the current session.
  A parallel REVIEW session is created when the REVIEW TSO subcommand
  (not the ISPF TSO subcommand) is used to create a recursive REVIEW
  session.  The nesting order of these sessions can be changed by SWAP.
)X Syntax -
     SWAP   LIST / NEXT / PREV / # / 'name'

 Aliases  - None.
 Default  - switch to previous screen which is listed second
            by SWAP LIST
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'name'   - Specifies the target screen name which can be up to
            eight characters long.
))LIST    - Specifies that all parallel REVIEW sessions are to be
            listed.
))NEXT    - Requests switching to next session in increasing
            session-id order.
))PREV    - Requests switching to next session in decreasing
            session-id order.
))#       - Specifies the decimal number of the target session
            that is to be swapped with the current session.
            'SWAP 0' is a no-operation.
=TSO=TSS
)F Function -
  The TSO subcommand specifies a TSO command processor to be
  invoked from the FSHELP processor. CLISTs are not supported.
)X Syntax -
     TSO  'command' 'operands'

 Alias    - TSS
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'command'
)O Operands -
)P 'command'  - Specifies a TSO command to be executed.

)P 'operands' - Specifies any desired operands for this TSO command.
=LIST=L=LOC=LOCATE
)F Function -
  The LIST subcommand repositions the screen to the relative line
  number entered.
)X Syntax -
     LIST 'lineno'

 Aliases  - L, LOC, LOCATE
 Defaults - None.
 Required - lineno
)O Operands -
)P 'lineno' -  Specifies the relative line number to which the screen
               is to be positioned.
=APPEND=ADD=TACKON
)F Function -
  The APPEND subcommand causes REVIEW to write records from the
  data being REVIEWed to an output data set.  Records are written
  consecutively from the first record shown on the screen until
  the requested number of records has been copied or end-of-file is
  reached.  When complete, the first record AFTER the copied records
  is made the new top-of-screen record.  The APPEND subcommand
  performs the same processing as the COPYOUT subcommand except that
  the output file is opened for EXTEND, so that data is appended to
  any data already residing in the output file.

  ** Note that PDS members cannot be extended.

  A major advantage that the COPYOUT and APPEND subcommands provide
  is the ability to copy data that has been rendered inaccessible by
  I/O errors.  Data beyond an I/O error can be REVIEWed with the use
  of the NEWTOP subcommand.  Any data that can be REVIEWed can be
  copied and saved to an intermediate file for data reclamation.

  Another feature of COPYOUT and APPEND is selectivity.  Not only
  can records be selected by manually scrolling to a specific record
  and cutting a specific number of records, but selectivity can be
  automated with FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL.  Only records eligible
  for display can be copied, so FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL subcommands
  can be used to exclude records based on their data content not
  only from display but also from offloading by COPYOUT and APPEND.

  Further, data copied from an ASCII file can be converted to EBCDIC
  by specifying ASCII ON before commencing the COPYOUT operation.

  The user will be prompted with a data entry panel to specify the
  output data set.
)X Syntax -
     APPEND 'record-count'

 Aliases  - ADD, TACKON
 Defaults - copy to end-of-file.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'record-count'
              - Specifies the number of records to be copied.
                If not specified then data is copied until end-of-file
                is reached or forced by an I/O error.
=COPYOUT=CUTOFF=CUT=CUTOVER
)F Function -
  The COPYOUT subcommand causes REVIEW to write records from the
  data being REVIEWed to an output data set.  Records are written
  consecutively from the first record shown on the screen until
  the requested number of records has been copied or end-of-file is
  reached.  When complete, the first record AFTER the copied records
  is made the new top-of-screen record.  The COPYOUT subcommand
  performs the same processing as the APPEND subcommand except that
  the output file is opened for OUTPUT, so that data already residing
  in the output file is overwritten and lost.

  A major advantage that the COPYOUT and APPEND subcommands provide
  is the ability to copy data that has been rendered inaccessible by
  I/O errors.  Data beyond an I/O error can be REVIEWed with the use
  of the NEWTOP subcommand.  Any data that can be REVIEWed can be
  copied and saved to an intermediate file for data reclamation.

  Another feature of COPYOUT and APPEND is selectivity. Not only
  can records be selected by manually scrolling to a specific record
  and cutting a specific number of records, but selectivity can be
  automated with FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL.  Only records eligible
  for display can be copied, so FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL subcommands
  can be used to exclude records based on their data content not
  only from display but also from offloading by COPYOUT and APPEND.

  Further, data copied from an ASCII file can be converted to EBCDIC
  by specifying ASCII ON before commencing the COPYOUT operation.

  The user will be prompted with a data entry panel to specify the
  output data set.
)X Syntax -
     COPYOUT 'record-count'

 Aliases  - CUTOFF, CUT, CUTOVER
 Defaults - copy to end-of-file.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'record-count'
              - Specifies the number of records to be copied.
                If not specified then data is copied until end-of-file
                is reached or forced by an I/O error.
=CANCEL=CAN
)F Function -
  The CANCEL subcommand performs the same processing as the END
  subcommand without saving the REVIEW/FSHELP user profile to disk.
  The REVIEW/FSHELP user profile (which contains data display colors,
  scrolling amount and 24 PF Key values) is normally only rewritten to
  disk at the END of a REVIEW session if it has been changed during
  that session.  If a member list has not been displayed in a session
  then the REVIEW session is terminated without saving the user
  profile.  If a member list has been shown it is reshown but the user
  profile is no longer considered to have been altered, even though the
  profile "in-core" still has the changes applied to it.  Changing the
  profile at this stage and exiting will cause all accumulated profile
  changes for the REVIEW session to be saved to disk unless another
  CANCEL is issued.
)X Syntax -
     CANCEL

 Alias    - CAN
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=END
)F Function -
  The END subcommand terminates the FSHELP command, or, if in member
  selection mode, returns to the member selection list.  The member
  selection list may be bypassed with the EXIT command.
)X Syntax -
     END

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=EXIT=RETURN==X
)F Function -
  The EXIT subcommand terminates the FSHELP command, bypassing
  the member selection list.
)X Syntax -
     EXIT

 Aliases  - RETURN, =X
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
