*                    TSO HELP FOR 'REVEDIT' RELEASE 49.7    AUGUST 2020
)F Function -
  REVEDIT is the fullscreen editor component of the REVIEW command.
  REVEDIT is not a TSO command, but this HELP member will be accessed
  when HELP is requested in a non-ISPF environment.

  The TSO command to access the REVIEW Editor directly is REVED.

  REVEDIT allows the editing of MVS data sets residing on direct
  access storage devices (DASD) which may contain records which have
  a fixed-length or variable-length format.  Currently only non-VSAM
  is supported.

  When the REVED alias of REVIEW is used to process a PDS, the default
  action of the 'S' selection code is changed from Browse to Edit.

  The data set being browsed by REVIEW can be edited with REVEDIT
  by issuing an UPDATE or EDIT or VIEW primary command.  If REVIEW is
  operating as an ISPF application, then the EDIT and VIEW commands
  will invoke the corresponding ISPF function instead of REVEDIT.

  Under MVS/ESA and later (including OS/390 and z/OS) data being
  edited may be held in a data space which can grow with the data up
  to two gigabytes (2GB) in size subject to installation limits
  implemented either by design (eg. system exits) or circumstance (eg.
  insufficient auxiliary storage to allow processing to continue).

  On pre-ESA systems data being edited is held in the user region.

  REVEDIT can also be invoked in VIEW mode indicated by blue (instead
  of green) line numbers.  Changes made to the data in VIEW mode
  cannot be saved back to the data set being viewed.  Data being
  viewed - whether changed or not - can be exported using the CREATE
  and/or REPLACE subcommands.

  When a data set is being edited it is serialized to protect against
  concurrent update.  This serialization is not performed for VIEW.
)X Syntax -
         REVED   'dsname'
                    VOLUME('volume')
                    UNIT('unit')
                    QUICK
                    GEN
                    XISPMODE
     or
         REVED   'filename'  FILE  XISPMODE
     or
         REVED   'pathname'

  Required - 'dsname'
     or      'filename'  FILE
     or      'pathname'  which must begin with a slash or tilde
     or      no operands for "point and shoot".

  Defaults - UNIT(SYSALLDA) when VOLUME is specified.
)O Operands -
)P 'dsname' or 'dsname(member)' - The data set to be examined.
   'filename' - The DDNAME allocated to the data set to be examined.
   'pathname' - The path name of an UNIX directory.

   If the first operand begins with a slash ('/') or a tilde ('~')
   then it is deemed to specify an UNIX directory path, and no other.
   operands are allowed.  The tilde specifies the user's home
   directory.  A specific UNIX file may be specified to directly
   access the data contained in the file.

   If the first operand does not begin with a slash or tilde then it
   is assumed to be a DSNAME unless it is followed by the keyword
   'FILE'.

   Specifying the file name of PARMLIB when there is no PARMLIB DD
   allocated on a OS/390 1.2 or later system requests that the
   logical PARMLIB service be used to REVED the system PARMLIB
   concatenation.

   If no operands are supplied then REVED reads the screen image
   and extracts the data set name from the part of the screen
   containing the cursor.  This works in both fullscreen and line
   modes, but not under Session Manager which updates the screen
   before REVED receives control.  If a data set name is not found
   then normal TSO prompting is commenced except for a recursive
   REVIEW/REVED session where a message is displayed.

   ISPF users may like to load
       TSO REV) MODE(FSCR
   into a PF key for easy access to "point and shoot", although
       TSO REV
   provides the same functionality since OS/390 2.10.  Similarly,
       TSO REV
   can be loaded into a RFE/REVIEW/REVED Program Function key.

   A member name is NOT considered part of the data set name for
   "point and shoot" purposes.

   A UNIX path name cannot be processed by "point and shoot".

))FILE     - This keyword indicates that the first operand is
             a FILENAME, not a DSNAME.  This is useful for looking
             at a temporary data set or at concatenated libraries.
             A member name may be specified in the first operand
             after the DDNAME if the DDNAME is allocated to a
             PDS.  This allows you to enter 'REVED SYSPROC(X) F'
             to edit member 'X' in whatever PDS is allocated to
             DDNAME 'SYSPROC'.

             The 'FILE' operand may be abbreviated to 'F'.

))VOLUME('volume') - For uncataloged data sets, the volume serial.

             'VOLUME' may be abbreviated to 'V'.

))UNIT('unit') - For uncataloged data sets, the unit type.
             This operand is ignored if 'VOLUME' is not specified.
             If 'VOLUME' is specified the default unit is 'SYSALLDA'.
             For data sets accessed via the catalog, the unit is
             determined from the catalog entry.

             'UNIT' may be abbreviated to 'U'.

))QUICK    - This indicates that if an unquoted data set name was
             specified then the name was fully qualified apart from
             the prefix (ie. no trailing qualifier has to be added).
             This saves a search of the catalog to look for trailing
             qualifiers which is otherwise performed unconditionally
             unless the 'VOLUME' operand was specified.  This operand
             is ignored if 'VOLUME' is specified.

             The 'QUICK' operand may be abbreviated to 'Q'.

))GEN      - This operand - valid for z/OS systems only - specifies
             that if the member list of a Version 2 PDSE data library
             which may have generation members is to be shown, then
             all extant member generations should also be shown in
             the member list.  The 'REF N' and 'REF G' member list
             commands can be used to dynamically switch the display
             of member generations in the member list.  Currently,
             the display of member generations for PDSE program
             libraries is not supported.

             The 'GEN' operand may be abbreviated to 'G'.

))XISPMODE - This specifies that REVED
             1) is not to act as an ISPF application and is therefore
                to perform terminal I/O and subcommand processing
                natively; and
             2) is not to determine terminal capabilities from ISPF
                variables but is to issue a Read Partition (Query)
                itself if appropriate.

             This operand will only affect processing in an ISPF
             environment.

             The 'XISPMODE' operand may be abbreviated to 'X'.

))PFK      - This is not an operand, but a description of
             the Program Function Keys used by this command.
              PFK1  - HELP    PFK2  - START      PFK3  - END
              PFK4  - TSO     PFK5  - RFIND      PFK6  - RCHANGE
              PFK7  - UP      PFK8  - DOWN       PFK9  - SWAP NEXT
              PFK10 - LEFT    PFK11 - RIGHT      PFK12 - RECALL
              PFK13 - TOP     PFK14 - BOTTOM     PFK15 - END
              PFK16 - SMF     PFK17 - RFIND      PFK18 - EREP
              PFK19 - UP      PFK20 - DOWN       PFK21 - HEX
              PFK22 - ASCII   PFK23 - TSO REV    PFK24 - HEXC
             These can be changed using the PFK# subcommand, but the
             changes are in effect only until the command ends unless
             a profile data set is allocated to DDNAME 'ISPPROF'
             under z/OS or 'REVPROF' under MVS/370.
             Example: 'PFK6 RIGHT 1' would make PFK6 'RIGHT 1'.

)F Function -
  The FIND subcommand positions the display to a data string, and
  the record containing the matched data will have any display
  exclusion status reset.

  FIND notes:
   1.  A search argument is required.  A single unquoted asterisk
       may be used to specify the same argument as was last used.
   2.  The first operand is always treated as the search argument.
   3.  The search argument determines whether the search is case
       sensitive, case insensitive or for a picture string, or
       for a string of hexadecimal digits byte-aligned with two
       digits per data byte.
   4.  Quotation marks are required whenever the string type needs
       to be specified.
   5.  Quotation marks are optional for the default string type
       unless the string contains one or more blank characters.
   6.  Operands specifying various keywords and/or scope restrictions
       may be supplied in any order after the search argument.
)X Syntax -
     FIND 'string'  'column-1'  'column-2'

                     EX / NX
                     UPDATED / NOUPDATE

 Alias    - F
 Defaults - NEXT
 Required - 'string'
)O Operands -
)P 'string'  - Specifies the data and data type to locate.
              Quoted strings may have the string type indicated
              before the leading quote or after the trailing quote.
              String types are:

              C - Character for case sensitive search.

              T - Text for case insensitive search.

              X - Hexadecimal digits (byte-aligned and two to a byte).

              P - Picture data where special mask characters represent
                  various categories of data.  Valid picture masks are:
                     ¬ - any non-blank character.
                     $ - any special character.
                     = - any character.
                     # - any decimal numeric character.
                     - - any non-numeric character.
                     @ - any alphabetic character.
                     > - any upper case alphabetic character.
                     < - any lower case alphabetic character.
                     . - any non-displayable character.
                  Non-mask characters represent themselves, with
                  matching of specific alphabetics being case
                  insensitive.

              Unquoted strings and strings without a string type
              specified are treated as text (type T) strings,
              which requests a case insensitive search.

)P 'column-1' - Optional, specifies first or only column to search.
)P 'column-2' - Optional, specifies last column where the string
              may end.
)P 'label-1' - Optional, specifies the label of the first record
             within the search range, which may or may not be the
             first record searched depending on the search direction,
             the cursor location, the current vertical scrolling
             location, and any specified keywords.  A search in the
             backward direction will not search records earlier in
             the data than this record.
)P 'label-2' - Required if 'label-1' is specified, specifies the label
             of the last record in the search range. Searches in the

   2.  The first operand is always treated as the search argument
       unless one of ALL, UPDATED or NOUPDATE is the only operand
       specified.
   3.  The search argument determines whether the search is case
       sensitive, case insensitive or for a picture string, or
       for a string of hexadecimal digits byte-aligned with two
       digits per data byte.
   4.  Quotation marks are required whenever the string type needs
       to be specified.

   1.  A search argument or "from string" is required, as is a
       data replacement specification or "to string".  For either
       operand (or both operands) a single unquoted asterisk may be
       used to specify the same argument as was last used
   2.  The first operand is always treated as the search argument.
   3.  The search argument determines whether the search is case
       sensitive, case insensitive or for a picture string, or
       for a string of hexadecimal digits byte-aligned with two
       digits per data byte.
   4.  If the replacement specification is a picture string then
       it must be the same length as the search argument.
   5.  The only picture string mask characters that are recognised
       in the "to string" are '=' (to leave the character unchanged),
       '>' (to perform upper case translation), and '<' (to perform
       lower case translation).  All other characters are processed
       literally.
   6.  Quotation marks are required whenever the string type needs
       to be specified.
   7.  Quotation marks are optional for the default string type
       unless the string contains one or more blank characters.
   8.  Operands specifying various keywords and/or column numbers
       may be supplied in any order after the search argument.

                  The picture string must have the same length
                  as the search argument.  Picture string mask
                  characters will be treated as actual replacement
                  characters when ASCII ON is active.

  line command is not required.

  An optional operand may be used to directly specify the source of
  the data to be copied.  If a member of a partitioned data set is
  being edited and the operand specified is unquoted, contains no
  periods, and does not exceed 8 characters in length, then the
  operand is taken to specify another member in the data set being
  edited; otherwise the operand is deemed to specify a data set name.

  LABEL is not a subcommand.

  This HELP entry documents the use of line labels.

  A label is assigned by entering the label name by itself in the
  left margin or line command area on the screen line displaying the
  record to be labelled.  The label can then be used in a LOCATE
  command to reposition the display back to the labelled record.

  Also, a pair of line labels can be used in a LOCATE or RESET
  command to restrict the scope of the requested action.

  A record cannot have more than one label at a time.

  Reusing the same label for a different record will remove that
  label from the record that was associated with it earlier.
)X Syntax -
     '.label'

  where '.label' is a character string which does not exceed 6
  characters in length, starts with a period, and is followed only
  by alphabetic characters.

  The alphabetic characters will be folded to upper case automatically
  both when the label is assigned and when used as a command operand.

  A further restriction on the name of user-defined labels is that
  the second character may not be 'Z', which is reserved for internal
  labels.

  Automatically defined internal labels are:
      .ZFIRST - the first record

 Defaults - None - reset to default bounds.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'column-1' - specifies the first or left-most column within the
                active bounds.  If specified as an asterisk then the
                left bound is not changed.  It must not be greater
                than 'column-2'.
)P 'column-2' - specifies the last or right-most column within the
                active bounds.  If specified as an asterisk then the
                right bound is not changed.  It must not be less
                than 'column-2'.
=CUT
)F Function -
  The CUT subcommand copies selected records from the edit data
  to the clipboard, which is a holding area in your TSO session's
  region.  Records in the clipboard can be subsequently copied
  into active edit data by the PASTE subcommand.

  Records to be copied to the clipboard can only be specified by
  a C line command or by a CC-CC block command.
)X Syntax -
       CUT     R / A

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - R
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))R           - Requests that existing records in the clipboard
                are discarded.  If no new edit data records are
                selected then the only function of the command
                is to empty the clipboard.
))A           - Requests that existing records in the clipboard
                are retained.  New selected records are appended
                to the existing contents of the clipboard.
=PASTE
)F Function -
  The PASTE subcommand copies the contents of the clipboard
  into the active edit data.  The contents of the clipboard are
  not altered, and can be copied again by a subsequent PASTE
  operation.

  The target location for the PASTE is specified by an A (for
  'after') or a B (for 'before') line command.  When editing an
  empty data set or member the target location does not have to
  be specified.

  Data to be pasted is loaded into the clipboard by the CUT
  subcommand.
)X Syntax -
       PASTE

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=HILITE=HI
)F Function -
  The HILITE subcommand controls syntax coloring and highlighting.
  This status is saved in the profile if one exists.  The highlighting
  is only ever displayed when 80-byte records are being edited.
)X Syntax -
     HILITE AUTO / ASM / CLIST / JCL / PLI / DATA / OFF

 Alias    - HI
 Default  - None.
 Required - one of AUTO, ASM, JCL or OFF.
)O Operands -
))AUTO    - specifies that both JCL and non-JCL source highlighting
            may be displayed.  JCL syntax highlighting is used for
            records beginning with '//' or '/*'.  Other source types
            may be detected based upon the data content, especially
            the first non-comment record.
))JCL     - specifies JCL syntax highlighting is to be displayed
            whenever records beginning with '//' or '/*' are shown.
            Non-JCL records will not be highlighted.
))ASM     - specifies that automatic syntax highlighting is to be
            enabled, and that Assembler source syntax highlighting
            is to be used for non-JCL records in this session.
))CLIST   - specifies that automatic syntax highlighting is to be
            enabled, and that TSO CLIST source syntax highlighting
            is to be used for non-JCL records in this session.
))PLI     - specifies that automatic syntax highlighting is to be
            enabled, and that PL/I source syntax highlighting is
            to be used for non-JCL records in this session.
))DATA    - specifies that automatic syntax highlighting is to be
            enabled, but that no highlighting is to be used for
            non-JCL records in this session.
))OFF     - specifies syntax highlighting is never to be displayed.
            This also suppresses JCL highlighting extensions such
            as data set name catalog look-up.
=DSNCHECK=DSNCHK=DSNC
)F Function -
  The DSNCHECK subcommand controls the handling of data set names
  when JCL syntax highlighting is active.  When a data set name is
  recognized after DSN= in JCL, a catalog search is made for that
  data set.  If it is found in the catalog then the name is highligted
  with underscores, otherwise it is shown in blue.

  In some cases such as when there are catalog errors, the catalog
  searches may generate problems.  DSNCHECK provides a way to disable
  the catalog searches without disabling all JCL syntax coloring.

  Note that &SYSUID is the only symbol that is automatically
  resolved before the catalog is searched.  Any other occurrence of
  an ampersand in the data set name will prevent a catalog search.
)X Syntax -
     DSNCHECK  ON / OFF / ?

 Alias    - DSNCHK, DSNC
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON     - Enables data set catalog status highlighting.
))OFF    - Disables data set catalog status highlighting.
))?      - Display the current setting without changing it.
=TABS
)F Function -
  The TABS commands sets optional software tabbing columns.  After
  entering data on a line, pressing <emter> will cause the cursor
  to be moved to the next tab column, which can facilitate more
  convenient data entry when entering formatted data.
)X Syntax -
     TABS    'col1' ('col2') ('col3') ...

 Alias    - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'col1'
)O Operands -
)P   The valid operands are 1 or more column numbers.
  All operands must be numeric and unquoted.
  No column number is allowed to exceed the maximum record length.
  A TABS command will replace any previous active tab settings.
  'TABS 0' can be used to clear active tab settings.
))OFF    - Disables data set catalog status highlighting.
=UNDO
)F Function -
  The UNDO subcommand without operands instructs the editor to
  restore the data to the state that existed before the latest
  changes input by the user were applied.  Only changes performed
  in the current Edit session since UNDO was last activated can be
  undone.  No more than 31 consecutive UNDOs can ever be performed,
  and this number may not be achievable for large data sets.

  The UNDO subcommand with an operand controls whether UNDO is
  enabled or disabled.  UNDO will not be enabled if the data width
  exceeds an internal limit of around four thousand columns, nor
  if there are more records than an arbitrary internal limit.

  Use REDO to undo an UNDO.
)X Syntax -
     UNDO  ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Perform an UNDO operation.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON     - Specifies that necessary resources are to be acquired
         and that UNDO is to be enabled.
))OFF    - Specifies that UNDO is to be disabled and its associated
         resources can be released.
=REDO
)F Function -
  The REDO subcommand instructs the editor to reapply the changes
  which were removed by the most recent UNDO subcommand (that has
  not also been redone).

  REDO is only available if UNDO is enabled and has not not been
  disabled since the UNDO subcommand being backed out.  Once manual
  changes are applied to the edit data after an UNDO, that UNDO can
  no longer be backed out by REDO.

  Use UNDO to undo changes to the data before using REDO.
)X Syntax -
     REDO

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=CANCEL=CAN
)F Function -
  The CANCEL subcommand instructs REVEDIT to discard all data
  being edited and terminate.
)X Syntax -
     CANCEL

 Alias    - CAN
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=SAVE
)F Function -
  The SAVE subcommand instructs REVEDIT to write the data being edited
  back to the data set which is the nominal source of the data.
)X Syntax -
     SAVE

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=AUTOSAVE
)F Function -
  The AUTOSAVE subcommand specifies whether the END subcommand
  will perform an automatic save of the data, or prompt the user
  for a SAVE or CANCEL command.
)X Syntax -
     AYTOSAVE  ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON     - Specifies that the END subcommand will automatically
         save the data if it has been changed before terminating
         the REVEDIT session.
))OFF    - Specifies that the END subcommand will prompt the user
         to save or discard the data if it has changed before the
         REVEDIT session can be terminated.
=END
)F Function -
  The END subcommand instructs REVEDIT to terminate the Edit
  session.

  If no change was made to the data then the data will not be
  written back to disk.

  If AUTOSAVE is ON and the data was changed then the data
  will be saved back to the data set being edited.

  If AUTOSAVE is OFF and the data was changed then a message
  requesting that SAVE or CANCEL be entered will be displayed.

  If END invokes the SAVE function but the SAVE fails, then REVEDIT
  will not terminate the session.
)X Syntax -
     END

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=EXIT=RETURN==X
)F Function -
  The EXIT subcommand performs the same processing as END, except
  that if REVEDIT was invoked from a member selection list then the
  member selection list will not be displayed but instead the entire
  REVIEW session will end.
)X Syntax -
     EXIT

 Aliases  - RETURN, =X
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
