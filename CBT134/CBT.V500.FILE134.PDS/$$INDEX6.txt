NOTE THAT TERMTEST MAY GET SB00 ABEND IF YOUR ISPPROF DATA SET HAS A

     BPAMBUFR TO YOUR BLOCKSIZE VALUE AND RE-ASSEMBLE AND LINK-EDIT.

                        GENERAL NOTES


1) SUPERLST BATCH VTOC LISTER WORKS FINE ON 3380-K'S AND 3390'S.
   JUST WATCH OUT IF DOS CONVERTED BIT (DS4DOCVT IN DS4VTOCI) IS ON.
   THIS BIT SEEMS TO GET TURNED ON BY THE VTOC CONVERSION ROUTINE WHEN
   CONVERTING TO OS-FORMAT FROM IX-FORMAT (USING DSF).  I JUST ZAP IT
   OFF TO MAKE SUPERLST HAPPY.  IF LEFT ON, SUPERLST APPARENTLY CANNOT
   ACCOUNT FOR FREE-SPACE TRACKS WHEN VTOC-INDEXING IS RE-ACTIVATED.
   ON ONE OCCASION I TURNED THE BIT OFF BUT IT SEEMED TO TAKE A FEW
   MINUTES FOR THE SYSTEM (IE. CVAF) TO "REALIZE" THAT IT WAS OFF.
   (PERSONALLY, I THINK THE SYSTEM WAS OFFENDED BY MY RECKLESS AND
   IRRESPONSIBLE "ZAP-AND-BE-DAMNED" ATTITUDE.  BUT I COULD BE WRONG.
   AFTER ALL, BOTH THE SYSTEM AND I HAD WORKED PRETTY HARD THAT DAY,
   AND ONE OF US MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AS SHARP AS AT THE START OF THE DAY.)

2) HAD A PDSE WITH SPACE=(CYL,(1,1)) AND SMS FIELDS IN DSCB-1 INDICATED
   SECONDARY QUANTITY WAS 313 BYTES WITH 256 COMPACTION FACTOR.
   SINCE 313*256=80128 (WHICH WAS DISPLAYED BY SHOWDS) I DO NOT
   KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS.  FOR 3390, 15*50K=750K, SO I THINK
   THE DSCB FIGURES ARE TOO SMALL BY ABOUT A FACTOR OF TEN.

3) AT PUT9007+DFP3.2/SMS/TSO-E PTFS QSAM ACCESS TO PDSE DIRECTORY SEEMS
   TO HAVE A BUG.  (TRIED RECFM=U,BLKSIZE=256 AND RECFM=F,LRECL=256,
   BLKSIZE=256.)  THE FIRST GET RETURNS A NULL BLOCK.  THE SECOND GET
   RETURNS WHAT SHOULD BE THE FIRST BLOCK, AND SO ON.  THE FIRST
   FULLWORD OF THE NULL BLOCK MAY BE NON-ZERO IF BUFNO IS GREATER
   THAN 1.  IF IT IS NON-ZERO THEN IT APPEARS TO CONTAIN THE ADDRESS
   OF THE NEXT QSAM BUFFER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED EXCEPT FOR E-O-F.
   (PDSE'S DO NOT HAVE UNUSED DIR BLOCKS - EXPECT E-O-F AFTER LAST
   USED DIR BLOCK.)  COULD NOT REPEAT PROBLEM WITH IEBGENER OR REPRO,
   BUT I HAVE SUPPLIED A SMALL PROGRAM - PDSETEST - TO DEMONSTRATE.
   FEEL FREE TO LET ME (OR SAM GOLOB) KNOW WHERE I HAVE GONE WRONG.
   IMPACT ON REVIEW: WHEN REVIEWING "PHYSICAL" DIRECTORY WITH 'DATA'
   OPERAND THERE IS NO PROBLEM.  WHEN SHOWING A PDSE MEMBER LIST
   THERE WAS A GARBAGE MEMBER AS THE FIRST ENTRY, WITH THE ACTUAL
   MEMBERS FOLLOWING.  SO, REVIEW WAS CHANGED TO IGNORE BLOCKS THAT
   HAVE LESS THAN 14 BYTES USED (2-BYTE COUNTER + 12-BYTE MINIMUM
   ENTRY).  IF QSAM BUFFERS ARE ABOVE THE X'000E0000'=896K LINE
   THEN THIS PROBLEM MAY RECUR.  TO TEST IF THIS IS SO ON YOUR SYSTEM
   A) ASSEMBLE AND LINK-EDIT PDSETEST FROM THIS FILE AND UNDER TSO DO:
        ALLOC F(PDSEFILE) DA(YOUR.PDSE)
        CALL YOUR.LOAD(PDSETEST)
      AND LOOK AT DISPLAYED HEX
           =OR=
   B) GET PDSE WITH ONE MEMBER AND REVIEW TO SHOW MEMBER LIST.
      THEN HIT PF5/17.  IF MORE THAN ONE DIRECTORY BLOCK WAS READ
      THEN THIS "PROBLEM" IS ALSO ON YOUR SYSTEM.
      (I SAY ONE MEMBER TO MAKE IT EASY TO KNOW THE NUMBER OF
      DIRECTORY BLOCKS THAT WOULD BE USED (IE. 1).)

4) TONY WATSON, NOW OF AMDAHL NEW ZEALAND, HAS COLLECTED HIS JACKET
   FROM THE STATE BANK OF VICTORIA (MELBOURNE) AFTER FOUR AND A HALF
   YEARS.  (YES, IT DID STILL FIT.)
