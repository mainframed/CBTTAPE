  THIS IS THE SEVENTH SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED DECEMBER 1991.


$$$BRIEF - NOW MENTIONS USERMODS IN $SP3MODS.
           -------------------------------------------------------------
           FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT COUNTING JES "EXCPS" AT THE DD LEVEL:

           THE SUPPLIED MOD CONSISTS OF AN SVC AND ZAPS.
           THE SVC INCREMENTS THE COUNTER FOR THE DCB POINTED TO BY R1.
           THE ZAPS INVOKE THE SVC AT APPROPRIATE POINTS.
           MAKE SURE THE SVC IS FULLY INSTALLED BY THE TIME THE ZAPS
           ARE OPERATIONAL OR ABENDS WILL RESULT.
           THE SVC DEPENDS UPON THE STRUCTURE OF THE TIOT, DCB AND TCT,
           ALL OF WHICH ARE STABLE (OVER DECADES) MEANING THAT THE SVC
           SHOULD NOT NEED ANY CUSTOMIZING FOR YOUR SYSTEM LEVEL.
           (OF COURSE, FEEL FREE TO CHECK THE CODE!!)
              THE ZAPS MAY NEED RETROFITTING FOR YOUR SYSTEM LEVEL.
           THE TWO MODULES ZAPPED HAVE THREE AREAS VERIFIED/REPLACED.
           THE FIRST IS THE ADCONS AT FIXED OFFSETS NEAR THE START OF
           THE MODULE.  THESE ARE NOT CHANGED BUT CONTAIN THE OFFSETS
           OF THE SECOND AREA.  THE SECOND AREA OF THE MODULES HAVE
           BRANCH INSTRUCTIONS ZAPPED TO BRANCH TO THE THIRD AREA.
           THE OFFSET OF THE THIRD AREA IS GIVEN BY THE UNALTERED
           MODULE SIZE.  LINKAGE EDIT EXPANDS PROVIDE EXTRA NULLS
           WHICH ARE ZAPPED WITH EXTRA CODE TO ISSUE THE SVC ABOVE.
           GIVEN ALL OF THIS, THESE ZAPS SHOULD BE EASILY RETROFITTABLE.
              FOR QSAM, GET, PUT AND PUTX MACROS ARE COUNTED SO "EXCP"
           COUNTS SHOULD EQUAL LOGICAL RECORD COUNTS.
              FOR BSAM, CHECK MACROS ARE COUNTED SO "EXCP" COUNTS
           SHOULD EQUAL THE BLOCK COUNTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROCESSED
           HAD THE FILE GONE TO TAPE OR DISK.
              IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THIS PHILOSOPHY THEN YOU CAN CHANGE
           THE POINT AT WHICH THE SVC CALLS ARE PERFORMED.  JUST
           REMEMBER THAT THE SVC EXPECTS REGISTER 1 TO POINT TO THE DCB.
           -------------------------------------------------------------
ABEND    - ADDED EXTRA ENTRIES FOR ABEND S0E0 BECAUSE I GOT TIRED OF
           GOING TO THE MANUAL SO FREQUENTLY OF LATE.
           (GUESS WHAT I HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH.)
DYNALC   - (NEW.)  MACRO REQUIRED TO ASSEMBLE ZAP.  I FORGOT TO COPY IT
           FROM BRUCE BORDONARO'S FILE 186 BEFORE.
REVIEW   - IMPROVED SUPPORT FOR NON-MVS OS (IE. MSP) WITH 31-BIT
           ADDRESSING SO I ONLY NEED ONE VERSION OF REVIEW.
           ALSO, AVOID S0C4 WHEN REVIEWING TAPE LABELS AND ONLY
           VOL1 EXISTS, AND SUB/SUBMIT CAN NOW BE USED TO SUBMIT
           THE FILE BEING REVIEWED TO BATCH.  (NOTE: TSO SUBMIT IS
              INVOKED WITH REVIEW SUPPLYING THE DATA SET NAME AS THE
              ONLY OPERAND.  TSO SUBMIT CHECKS (IN THIS ORDER)
              1. DSORG IS PS OR PO.
              2. LRECL=80.
              3. RECFM INDICATES FIXED LENGTH RECORDS.
              REVIEW ALSO DOES THESE CHECKS AND SUPPRESSES THE CALL
              TO SUBMIT IF ANY ONE FAILS.
              OF COURSE, WE ALL KNOW ABOUT "PROPER" TSO COMMANDS
              USING DYNAMIC ALLOCATION TO FIND DATA SETS ALREADY
              ALLOCATED TO THE TSO SESSION, SO SUBMIT FROM REVIEW
              SHOULD WORK OKAY EVEN IF THE FILE BEING REVIEWED
              IS NOT CATALOGED.  JUST BE CAREFUL WHEN THERE IS MORE
              THAN ONE (1) DATA SET WITH THE SAME NAME ALREADY
              ALLOCATED TO YOUR SESSION, BECAUSE THE ONE SUBMITTED
              MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE ONE YOU ARE REVIEWING.
              THIS SHOULD ONLY BE OF CONCERN TO SYSTEM TYPES BECAUSE
              ALL USER FILES SHOULD BE CATALOGED, AND EVEN SYSRES
              FILES (WHERE THIS SCENARIO IS MOST LIKELY) PROBABLY
              DO NOT CONTAIN JCL ELIGIBLE TO SUBMIT.)
           ALSO, THE REVEDIT CSECT NOW RESETS THE ATTENTION FLAG AT EXIT
           TIME.  (REVEDIT IS THE CSECT THAT CALLS ISPF.)  THE PROBLEM
           WAS THAT WHEN IN ISPF EDIT OR BROWSE INVOKED FROM REVIEW, THE
           USER WAS USING PA1 AS THE ISPF SCREEN REFRESH BUTTON. THIS
           WORKED CORRECTLY BUT REVIEW WAS ALSO DETECTING THE ATTENTION
           AND SETTING ITS OWN FLAG ON.  WHEN ISPF WAS TERMINATED AND
           REVIEW HAD TO RE-READ THE PDS DIRECTORY REVIEW FOUND THE
           ATTENTION FLAG ON AND TERMINATED THE DIRECTORY READ AFTER
           JUST ONE MEMBER, SO THE RESULTING MEMBER LIST ONLY HAD THE
           FIRST MEMBER IN IT.
              (IF YOU JUST WANT THE SCREEN REFRESHED UNDER TSO, I WOULD
              ADVISE GETTING INTO THE HABIT OF USING PA2, EVEN UNDER
              ISPF.  I THINK IT IS A LOT SAFER.  NATURALLY, I CARRY THIS
              HABIT TO OTHER USERS' TERMINALS.  NATURALLY OTHER USERS
              USE PA2 AS A HOT KEY FOR SESSION SWAP, DON'T THEY?
                                                    (*SOB*)          )
           ALSO ALSO, NEWTOP CAN NOW ACCESS PDS DATA EVEN WHEN THERE
           ARE NO MEMBERS IN THE DATA SET.  TO DO THIS, YOU MUST SUPPLY
           A MEMBER NAME IN THE TSO COMMAND.
           EG.    REV 'SYS1.HELP(NOTHING)'
           REVIEW WILL BE INVOKED AND SHOW THE "MEMBER NOT FOUND"
           MESSAGE.  THEN ISSUE NEWTOP WITH A TTR OPERAND, AND DATA
           FROM THAT TTR WILL BE READ AND SHOWN (ASSUMING NO I/O
           ERRORS).  IF YOU ISSUE NEWTOP WITH 0 SPECIFIED OR AS THE
           DEFAULT THEN THE "MEMBER NOT FOUND" MESSAGE WILL AGAIN BE
           THE RESULT.
REVIEW#  - UPDATED TO INCLUDE SUB/SUBMIT.
REVIEW@  - UPDATED SOME DOCUMENTATION DETAILS, ESPECIALLY RELATING
           TO RMF CPU ACTIVITY FORMATTING.
REVSMF   - ENHANCED TYPE 70 DISPLAY.  ONE CP IS SHOWN FOR EACH
           PAGE SCROLLED RIGHT (WITH 'SMF ON' OF COURSE).
           PR/SM SHOPS MAY FIND THE DISPLAY NOT IMMEDIATELY 100%
           OBVIOUS, SO LOOK FOR THE '|'S IN COLUMN 1 IN REVIEW@.
SHOWDS   - ADDED MSP SUPPORT SO I ONLY NEED ONE VERSION.
           --------------- SHOWDS CHIT-CHAT -------------------------
           THE BEAUTY OF SHOWDS IS THAT IN GENERAL IT DOES NO
           ALLOCATION, SO VTOC DETAILS OF A DATA SET CAN BE DISPLAYED
           EVEN IF THE DATA SET IS EXCLUSIVELY ALLOCATED.  THIS IS
           DONE VIA AN OBTAIN.  HENCE, ONCE THE VOLUME IS KNOWN,
           SHOWDS MUST LOCATE THE UCB FOR THE OBTAIN.  AS A RESULT,
           SHOWDS MUST BE UPDATED WHENEVER A NEW UCB LOOK-UP METHOD
           IS REQUIRED BY THE OPERATING SYSTEM.  IT THEREFORE SEEMS
           THAT A FURTHER UPDATE FOR MVS/SP V4 WILL BE REQUIRED.
           NOTE THAT THE UCB LOOK-UP IS NOT REQUIRED WHEN THE DDNAME
           IS SUPPLIED, SO SHOWDS OF A DDNAME SHOULD WORK UNALTERED
           ON ALL (YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN) OPERATING SYSTEMS.
           (ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE OF NOT DOING AN ALLOCATION IS THAT A
           SHOWDS OF A MIGRATED DATA SET WILL NOT INITIATE A RECALL.)
           ----------------------------------------------------------
WORM     - CORRECTED BUGS UNDER MSP AF-II (IE. "MSP/EX").

********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************
           FUJITSU FINDINGS  (MAINLY FOR NON-U.S. READERS)
           ======= ========
           OSIV/F2 IS LIKE DOS/VS.
           OSIV/X8 IS FUJITSU'S PROPRIETRY MULTI-TASK MULTI-A.S. OS.
           OSIV/F4 IS LIKE MVS.
           X8 CHANGED TO FSP.
           F4 CHANGED TO MSP (MULTIDIMENSIONAL SYSTEM PRODUCT).
           OSIV/F4 E30 WAS LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN SVS AND MVS.
           OSIV/F4 E40 WAS LIKE MVS 3.8 (VANILLA).  (E MEANS EDITION.)
           MAINTENANCE AND THE AF-JES PRODUCT TAKES YOU THROUGH
           MVS/SE2 TO ABOUT MVS/SP1.1.
           OSIV/F4 MSP E10 WAS JUST A TRANSITION ON THE WAY TO:
           OSIV/F4 MSP E20.  ADD LOTS OF MONEY TO ZAP THREE BITS FOR:
           OSIV/F4 MSP E20 AE (ADDRESSING EXTENSION).
           (AMODE=31 BIT IS BIT-4 OF THE PSW (IE. FIFTH BIT).)
           (LINKAGE EDITOR AMODE/RMODE BITS WERE INCOMPATIBLE.)
           (GETMAIN/FREEMAIN AND MACRO PARAMETER LISTS FOR 31-BIT
           STUFF WERE INCOMPATIBLE.)  (BSM AND BASSM WORK CORRECTLY.)
           THE LATEST OS IS
           OSIV MSP AF-II
           USUALLY KNOWN AS "MSP/EX".
           M-SERIES HARDWARE WAS LIKE SYSTEM/370 PLUS EXTRAS.
           (SEE "ZAP" OPCODE TABLE SOURCE FOR EXTRA OPCODES.)
           (SEE "VIEW" COMMENTS REGARDING CHANNEL-DAT AND CCW CODES.)
           (SEE "REVCMPBF" COMMENTS FOR "3270-ISH" EXTRAS.)
           THE EXA ARCHITECTURE NOW ALLOWS CROSS-MEMORY STUFF ET AL.
           MSP/EX NOW SUPPORTS MVS/XA GETMAIN/FREEMAIN AND LOAD MODULES
           (AS WELL AS THE OLD E20 AE STUFF).
           MSP/EX WILL "SOON" SUPPORT GQSCAN AND CROSS-MEMORY STUFF.
           SO, WHILE AE PROVIDED 31-BIT ADDRESSING, IT WAS EXA THAT
           FINALLY DID AWAY WITH SYSTEM/370 I/O ARCHITECTURE.

CVTDCB OS BITS:
           X'13' MVS/370
           X'93' MVS/XA
           X'9B' MVS/ESA
           X'12' OSIV/F4     (DOES ANYONE STILL RUN OS/VS2 SVS?)
           X'92' MSP/AF-II

STARTING WITH VIRTUAL ADDRESS ZERO WE HAVE:
         NUCLEUS (V=R) (FIRST 4K IS "FLC")
         PRIVATE AREA
         CSA                            AS USUAL, BORDERS BETWEEN
         MLPA  (IF USED)                PRIVATE AND COMMON AREAS
         PLPA                           MUST BE ON SEGMENT BOUNDARIES.
         SQA TO 00FFFFFF.               SEGMENT SIZE IS ONE MEGABYTE.
         EPVT                           EXPECT ACTUAL NUCLEUS TO BE
         ECSA                           SMALLER THAN 1MB, AND PRIVATE
         ELPA                           AREA TO START AT 1MB LINE.
         ESQA TO 7FFFFFFF.              IE. NOT ALL OF FIRST MB REAL
                                        SHOULD BE NUCLEUS PAGES.
THINGS I LIKE ABOUT MSP:
         1. PAGEADD CAN CREATE A NEW PAGE DATA SET (IF REQUESTED).
            (PAGE D/S HAS DSORG=PS IN VTOC.  KQCAMS IS NOT USED.
            IE. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS DEFINE PAGESPACE.
            USE PGM=KAXPGFM TO PRE-FORMAT.)
         2. IN PFD EDIT DATA CAN BE COPIED FROM ONE SPLIT SCREEN
            EDIT TO ANOTHER.  ('CE' OR 'CCE....CCE'-BLOCK ON ONE
            SCREEN AND 'AE' OR 'BE' ON THE OTHER SPLIT SCREEN.)
         3. STOW NOTIFIES VDF (VIRTUAL DIRECTORY FACILITY) OF
            LOAD MODULE (INCL. LINK LIST) UPDATE.
            (IE. NO EQUIVALENT OF 'F LLA,REFRESH' NEEDED.)
            ("VDF" IS ONLY ON THE LATEST MSP.)
         4. MOST SHOPS STILL GET TSSUTY (LIST, COPY AND MERGE).
         5. TSS EDIT HAS FSO (FULL SCREEN OPTION) WHICH IS HANDY
            IF PFD GETS BROKEN.  UNFORTUNATELY IT COSTS EXTRA.
         6. TSS PROMPTERS DON'T SEEM TO COST EXTRA.
            HENCE, ALL SYSTEMS HAVE THE "ASM" COMMAND.
         7. THEY DON'T RE-ORG THE CHKPT/SPOOL MUCH SO THE ORIGINAL
            QUEUE COMMAND STILL WORKS PRETTY WELL.
         8. THE JES JOB NUMBER IS ALSO STORED IN THE CSCB, WHICH
            IS HANDY FOR "DISPLAY JOBS"-TYPE COMMANDS.
         9. SVC 94 CAN DO MORE.  EG1. RETURN VTAM TERMINAL NAME.
            (NOTE THE "TERMTYPE" MACRO IN "TERMTEST".)
            EG2. "STNOCOM YES" MACRO STOPS EVEN HIGH-PRIORITY MESSAGES
            (WON'T INTERRRUPT FILE TRANSFER) AND QUEUES THEM.
            QUEUED MESSAGES GET RELEASED UPON "STNOCOM NO".

THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT MSP:
         1. CAN'T USE A PAGE DATA SET IF IT IS ON SHARED DASD.
            (SO, ZAP LOTS OF UCBS AT IPL TIME.)
         2. IT IS NOT MVS.  (THIS SAVES ME A LOT OF TYPING.)
         3. PFD IS NOT ISPF.
         4. OTHER PRODUCTS ARE NOT OTHER OTHER PRODUCTS.

THINGS MANAGERS LIKE ABOUT MSP:
         1. IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER.
         2. IT IS COMPATIBLE.

THINGS MANAGERS DON'T LIKE ABOUT MSP:
         1. IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE.
