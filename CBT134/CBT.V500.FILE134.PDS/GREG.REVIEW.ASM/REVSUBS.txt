*    FIRST OF ALL, THE "PATTERN PREPARATION PREPARATION"             *
*    NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE THE ACTUAL "PATTERN PREPAR-             *
*    ATION" IS PERFORMED.  PHASE 1 OF THIS IS TO LOCATE              *
*    ALL OCCURRENCES OF '*%' IN THE MASK AND REPLACE EACH            *
*    ONE WITH '%*' WHICH IS FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT BUT              *
*    MUCH EASIER TO PROCESS.  THIS EDITING COULD CREATE              *
*    MORE INSTANCES SO THE PROCESS IS REPEATED UNTIL NO              *
*    SUCH SUBSTRINGS ARE FOUND.  PHASE 2 IS TO CONVERT               *
*    ALL OCCURRENCES OF MULTIPLE CONSECUTIVE ASTERISKS               *
*    TO A SINGLE ASTERISK - AGAIN THE RESULT IS FUNCTION-            *
*    ALLY EQUIVALENT.  THE RESULT OF ALL THIS IS THE MASK            *
*    THE USER "SHOULD HAVE" SPECIFIED IN THE FIRST PLACE.            *
*                                                                    *
*    THE "PATTERN PREPARATION" CONSISTS OF LOCATING EACH             *
*    ASTERISK IN THE SUPPLIED MASK AND REPLACING IT WITH             *
*    A COUNTER BYTE CONTAINING THE NUMBER OF BYTES AFTER             *
*    THE ASTERISK WHICH MUST MATCH EXACTLY IN ORDER FOR              *
*    THE ASTERISK MASK TO BE MATCHED.  THIS COUNT WILL BE            *
*    ZERO ONLY FOR A TRAILING ASTERISK SINCE '**' AND '*%'           *
*    ARE PREVENTED FROM BEING PRESENT IN THE FULLY PRE-              *
*    PARED MASK USED BY THE COMPARISON PROCESS.                      *
*                                                                    *
*    THE 'RENMEMSV' FIELD WHICH FOLLOWS THE 'MEMPATEN'               *
*    FIELD IN STORAGE IS NOT USED AT THE TIME MEMBER NAME            *
*    PATTERN MATCHING OCCURS, AND SO IS AVAILABLE TO HOLD            *
*    "BACKSTOP" BLANKS.  'RENMEMSV' HAS BEEN BLANKED ALREADY         *
*    AND IS NOT BLANKED AFRESH HERE TO MAKE SURE, BECAUSE            *
*    IT MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY BLANK.  'PAT ABCDEFG', FOR               *
*    EXAMPLE, WOULD HAVE CAUSED AN ASTERISK TO BE LOADED             *
*    INTO ITS FIRST BYTE.                                            *
*                                                                    *
*    THIS LOGIC REPLACES EARLIER SIMPLER LOGIC WHICH COULD           *
*    MATCH 'A*SM' WITH 'ASM' AND 'AXSM' BUT NOT WITH 'ASSM'.         *
*                                                                    *

*        THIS ROUTINE PROVIDES THE CAPABILITY OF SEARCHING PDS       *
*        MEMBERS FOR SELECTED CHARACTER STRINGS.  MORE THAN ONE      *
*        MEMBER CAN BE SEARCHED IN ONE INVOCATION.  MEMBERS          *
*        CONTAINING THE SPECIFIED DATA ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE        *

*        THIS ROUTINE IS ALSO CALLED WHEN REGULAR FILES IN AN        *
*        HFS DIRECTORY ARE TO BE SEARCHED.  IN THIS CASE REVSRCH     *
*        MERELY DISPLAYS THE SEARCH SPECIFICATION DATA ENTRY SCREEN  *
*        AND PARSES AND PROCESSES THE INPUT BEFORE EXITING BACK TO   *
*        REVUNIX WHICH WILL DRIVE THE ACTUAL SEARCH.                 *
*                                                                    *
*        A PARAMETER LIST CAN NOW BE PASSED TO REVSRCH SO THAT       *
*        REVSRCH CAN PROCESS INTERNAL ENTRIES OF DIFFERENT FORMATS.  *
*        REVPDS AND REVPDSE USE THE PARAMETER LIST TO SPECIFY        *
*        THE OFFSETS OF THE TAG FLAG, LENGTH INDICATOR, AND MEMBER   *
*        NAME FIELDS.  REVUNIX DOES NOT SUPPLY A PARAMETER LIST      *
*        BECAUSE CONTROL IS RETURNED TO REVUNIX BEFORE ANY SEARCH    *
*        (AND THEREFORE ANY INTERNAL ENTRY PROCESSING) TAKES PLACE.  *
*                                                                    *
*        REVSRCH IS STILL NOT FULLY GENERALISED.  THE SCHHLDNM       *
*        AND SCHPRVMM FIELDS USED TO REDUCE SEARCHING OF ALIASES     *
*        WHEN THE RESULT IS ALREADY KNOWN ARE ONLY EXPLOITED FOR     *
*        SEARCHES INITIATED FROM REVPDS.  REVPDSE DOES NOT GET       *
*        CONTROL FOR CONCATENATED FILES SO DUPLICATE MEMBER NAMES    *
*        SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE.  THESE FIELDS ARE LOADED WITH DATA  *
*        FROM HARD-CODED OFFSETS INSTEAD OF USING PARAMETER VALUES,  *
*        AND ARE ONLY EXAMINED FOR REVPDS CALLS.                     *

*        THIS ROUTINE PROVIDES THE CAPABILITY OF SPEEDING UP         *

*        THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE, BUT         *
*        NOW THE MAIN PURPOSE IS TO ALLOW THE BROWSING OF DATA       *
*        WHICH DOES NOT EXIST IN A DATA SET AS SUCH, AND THE         *
*        EASY REFERENCING OF FILE DATA WITHOUT FURTHER I/O.          *
*        EXAMPLES ARE: THE FORMATTED DIRECTORY OF A ZIP ARCHIVE,     *
*        THE CONTENTS OF TSO HELP WITH INCLUDE MEMBERS RESVOLVED,    *
*        THE OUTPUT OF PROCESSES SUCH AS LISTCAT AND REVHIST         *
*        PROCESSING, DATA SETS OF SUBSYSTEMS WHICH DO NOT ALLOW      *
*        NOTE/POINT, AND SO ON.                                      *
*                                                                    *
*        THE ORIGINAL SCHEME OF A SINGLE CHUNK OF STORAGE LARGE      *
*        ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE BODY OF DATA HAS NOW BEEN REPLACED    *
*        BY A SCHEME WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE AREA TO BE EXPANDED AS     *
*        REQUIRED IF THE STORAGE IS AVAILABLE.                       *
*                                                                    *
*        SINCE THESE CHUNKS OF STORAGE WILL ACT LIKE AN INDEX        *
*        FOR RECORD RETRIEVAL, THE METHOD OF USING FIXED-LENGTH      *
*        SLOTS WHICH CAN ACCOMODATE MAXIMUM-LENGTH RECORDS HAS       *
*        BEEN DISPENSED WITH, AS HAS THE IDEA OF TRIMMING UNUSED     *
*        STORAGE ONCE END-OF-DATA HAS BEEN REACHED.                  *
*                                                                    *

*           INPUT DATA STREAM IN REPLY, OR OF PROCESSING THE PARSED  *
*           STRINGS IN THE OPL LIST.                                 *
*         - $4REFR WILL BE SET IF GLOBAL OR COMMON SUBCOMMANDS HAVE  *
*           UPDATED THE SCREEN SUCH THAT THE PROCESSING OF INPUT     *
*           DATA FROM THE DYNAMIC AREA SHOULD BE BYPASSED AND/OR     *
*           THE CALLER NEEDS TO COMPLETELY REPAINT THE SCREEN IMAGE. *
*         - REVCSR WILL CONTAIN 'ZCMD' AND REVPOS WILL BE SET TO 1.  *
*         - $13NTRM WILL BE SET IF A CHANGE TO THE TERMINAL SCREEN   *

*  PRIMARY SCREEN SIZE NOTES
*
*   ORIGINALLY 24 BY 80 = 1920 COULD BE RELIED TO BE THE PRIMARY SCREEN
*   SIZE OF ALL SCREENS.  NOW SOME USERS SET UP THEIR PRIMARY SCREEN TO
*   HAVE MORE THAN 24 LINES.  REVIEW SHOULD SUPPORT THIS (AS LONG AS
*   THE PRIMARY SCREEN WIDTH REMAINS AT 80 COLUMNS).  CALLERS USING
*   $10PSP HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO CLEAR THE WHOLE BUFFER, NOT JUST THE
*   FIRST 1920 BYTES TO THIS END.  HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE THE DISPLAYS
*   CREATED BY $10PSP CALLERS FIT INTO THE FIRST 1920 BYTES AND END
*   WITH BLANKS WHICH CAUSE THE X'3C404040' ORDER TO BE GENERATED BY
*   REVCMPBF SO THAT THE EXTRA LINES ARE CLEARED NICELY.  AS A RESULT,
*   IT IS SAFE TO PROCEED AS IF THE PRIMARY SIZE IS ALWAYS 24 BY 80.
*
*   FURTHER, IF THE ALTERNATE SCREEN SIZE HAS 80 COLUMNS, THEN THERE
*   IS NO REAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE SCREEN SIZE ACTUALLY BE CHANGED.
*   FOR 80-COLUMN DISPLAYS THE WHOLE SCREEN BUFFER IS ALWAYS SHOWN.
