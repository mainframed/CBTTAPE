*                     WHEN LOGGED ON TO A MODEL-5 SCREEN (27 BY 132)
*                     UNDER ISPF BUT ISPF DATA DOES NOT EXCEED 80
*                     COLUMNS ISPF PUTS THE SCREEN INTO MODEL-2 (24
*                     BY 80) MODE TO ENHANCE READABILITY.  (GOOD.)
*                     WHEN A TSO COMMAND IS ISSUED ISPF DOES A
*                     STLINENO LINE=1,MODE=OFF SO THAT WHEN THE NEXT
*                     LINE-MODE OUTPUT IS ISSUED TSO WILL DISPLAY THE
*                     OUTPUT WITH AN ERASE/WRITE ALTERNATE COMMAND
*                     WHICH WILL SET THE HARDWARE (IE. THE SCREEN) TO
*                     THE ALTERNATE (IE. 27 BY 132) SCREEN SIZE.
*                     27 BY 132) SCREEN SIZE.  (IF ISPF HAS THE SCREEN
*                     IN THE SAME SIZE AS LINE MODE SHOULD BE, THEN
*                     IT SEEMS TO ISSUE STLINENO LINE=20 (OR SO).)
*                     NOW, WHEN A TSO COMMAND INVOKES A FULLSCREEN
*                     APPLICATION FROM ISPF (MODEL-5 SCREEN IN MODEL-2

*                     DOES A GTSIZE TO GET THE SCREEN SIZE (HENCE THE

*                     WHILE STSIZE AND GTSIZE DEAL WITH THE SCREEN SIZE
*                     AS KNOWN BY THE SOFTWARE, THE PITY OF IT IS THAT

*         IF THE SECOND OPERAND IS 'FILE', THAT MEANS THE
*         FIRST OPERAND IS NOT A DSNAME BUT A DDNAME.
*
*         IF AN UNQUALIFIED DATA SET NAME IS ENTERED, THE
*         CATALOG MUST BE READ TWICE, ONCE TO APPEND A
*         TRAILING QUALIFIER IF NECESSARY, AND AGAIN DURING
*         ALLOCATION. THE USER CAN ELIMINATE THE FIRST BY USING
*         THE FULLY QUALIFIED NAME, PREFIX AND ALL, IN QUOTES,
*         OR BY ENTERING ALL BUT THE PREFIX, WITHOUT QUOTES,
*         PLUS THE KEYWORD 'Q'. THE LATTER IS MUCH SIMPLER
*         AND GIVES THE SAME PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT AS A
*         FULLY QUALIFIED NAME.
*
*         THE 'FILE' KEYWORD IS USEFUL FOR LOOKING AT TEMPORARY
*         DATA SETS.  IT TELLS THE COMMAND TO TREAT THE FIRST
*         OPERAND AS A FILENAME (DDNAME) INSTEAD OF A DSNAME.
*         WHATEVER DATA SET IS CURRENTLY ALLOCATED TO THE
*         FILENAME WILL BE DISPLAYED (AND QUICKLY, BECAUSE
*         THE COMMAND DOESN'T HAVE TO ALLOCATE ANYTHING).
*
*         THE 'DATA' KEYWORD INDICATES THAT INTERPRETATION OF
*         VSAM CONTROLINTERVAL INFORMATION FOR EXTRACTING
*         LOGICAL RECORDS IS NOT TO BE ATTEMPTED EVEN IF THE
*         DATA SET BEING REVIEWED IS A VSAM COMPONENT.  ITS
*         SPECIFICATION ALSO SUPPRESSES DIRECT ACCESS LOGIC
*         FOR FIXED-LENGTH RECORD NON-PARTITIONED DISK FILES.
*         FOR PARTITIONED DATA SETS ITS SPECIFICATION MEANS
*         THAT THE DATA SET'S DIRECTORY WILL BE REVIEWED AS A
*         SEQUENTIAL FILE WITHOUT ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS.
*
*         THE 'SUBSYS' OPERAND INDICATES THAT A SUBSYSTEM DATA
*         SET IS TO BE REVIEWED.  THE SPECIFIED SUBSYSTEM MUST
*         BE ACTIVE AND SUPPORT DATA SET ALLOCATION.  'REVVSAM'
*         MAY PROVIDE A SUITABLE VEHICLE FOR APF AUTHORIZATION.
*         'SUBSYS' AND 'VOLUME' ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OPERANDS.
*
*         THE 'TOP' OPERAND ALLOWS A 1 TO 6 HEXADECIMAL DIGIT
*         RELATIVE ADDRESS TO BE SPECIFIED AS THE TOP-OF-DATA.
*         THE ADDRESS IS TAKEN TO BE A TTR FOR DASD OR A BLOCK
*         ID FOR TAPE.  THE ADDRESS HAS THE SAME FORMAT AS THE
*         OPERAND OF THE 'NEWTOP' SUBCOMMAND.

.*           BER.  THE MACRO TRANSLATES THEM INTO THE 3270 CODE.      *
.*        .  ORDERS ARE SPECIFIED BY NAME, SUCH AS 'SBA' AND 'SF',    *
.*           SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW THE HEX CODES FOR THEM,        *
.*        .  COMMONLY USED ATTRIBUTE BYTES ARE SPECIFIED BY NAME      *
.*           (A SET OF RESERVED NAMES) SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW      *
.*           THE HEX CODES FOR THEM.                                  *
.*        .  IT SAVES A LOT OF DOCUMENTATION WORK, AND MAKES          *

.*        THE USER OF THE MACRO MUST STILL UNDERSTAND HOW A SCREEN    *
.*        IS CONSTRUCTED BEFORE USING IT. THE MACRO MERELY MAKES IT   *
.*        EASIER TO SPECIFY THE VALUES.  IT DOES VERY LITTLE ERROR    *
.*        CHECKING.  FOR INSTANCE, IT DOES NOT CHECK TO SEE IF        *
.*        YOU FOLLOW AN 'SBA' WITH A BUFFER ADDRESS.  IT IS POSSIBLE  *

*   FOR FAST TERMINATION WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANY MORE TERMINAL I/O,
*   BUT MERELY TELL THE SYSTEM THAT THIS FULLSCREEN APPLICATION HAS
*   FINISHED, AND THAT THE NEXT OUTPUT IS TO START ON THE FIRST LINE
*   (ASSUMING LINE MODE I/O), WHICH SHOULD CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO CLEAR
*   THE SCREEN WITH THE TPUT THAT SUPPLIES THE FIRST LINE.  BY POST-
*   PONING THIS ACTIVITY, 'REVIEW' IS FREE TO FINISH PRONTO.  MANY
*   PROGRAMS USE A TPUT TO CLEAR THE SCREEN, WHICH MAY INITIATE A SWAP
*   OUT AND THEREFORE NEEDLESSLY DELAY THE PROMPT FROM THE TMP OR ISPF
*   OR CALLER IN GENERAL.
*
*   CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES OF A DATA STREAM DISPLAY CHARACTER ARE
*   INHERITED FROM THE PREVIOUS CHARACTER BACK TO THE SET ATTRIBUTE
*   ORDERS.  THE DATA AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH WRITE WILL HAVE, IN THE
*   ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATE ORDERS, DEFAULT CHARACTER (AS DISTINCT FROM
*   FIELD) ATTRIBUTES.  THAT IS, FOR IBM 3270, CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES
*   TO BE INHERITED BY DISPLAY CHARACTERS ARE NOT REMEMBERED ACROSS
*   WRITE COMMANDS.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH FUJITSU
*   F668X SCREEN EQUIPMENT.  SUPPOSE A "MONOCHROME" PFD SESSION (REALLY
*   3-COLOURS) INVOKES REVIEW TO LOOK AT A PDS DIRECTORY.  PF3 WILL
*   EXIT REVIEW, BUT MAY LEAVE THE SCREEN WITH A COMPLETELY PINK (MORE
*   OF A LILAC, REALLY) PFD EDIT SESSION.  RATHER THAN LEAVE THE USER
*   TO HIT CLEAR AND THEN PA2, WE WILL ISSUE AN ERASE/WRITE OR
*   ERASE/WRITE ALTERNATE (DEPENDING ON SCREEN SIZES) WITH AN EXTRA
*   TPUT.  THIS IS A SCREEN EQUIPMENT DEPENDENCY AND NOT AN OPERATING
*   SYSTEM DEPENDENCY, SO:
*
*        CLI   SACHAR,X'0E'        FUJITSU TERMINAL HARDWARE?
*        BNE   SETMDOFF            NO, JUMP TO FAST EXIT
*
*   HOWEVER, SINCE PFD (UNLIKE ISPF) DOES NOT USE COLOUR AND HIGH-
*   LIGHTING, USERS OF IBM-COMPATIBLE COLOUR SCREENS ARE LEFT IN
*   2-COLOUR MODE INSTEAD OF 4-COLOUR MODE, WHEREAS IDEALLY THE
*   SCREEN SHOULD BE LEFT IN THE SAME MODE AS IT WAS BEFORE 'REVIEW'
*   WAS INVOKED.  HENCE, WE SHOULD END UP USING:
*
*        TM    OSBITS,X'13'        IBM OS?  (SOME FLAVOUR OF MVS?)
*        BO    SETMDOFF            YES, JUMP TO FAST EXIT
*
*   UNFORTUNATELY, THE LEVEL OF MVS 3.8J DOING THE ROUNDS (MAINLY TO
*   RUN UNDER THE HERCULES EMULATOR) HAS BUGS IN TSO TERMINAL CONTROL,
*   AND SPECIFYING LINE=1 ON THE STLINENO MACRO DOES NOT CAUSE THE TMP
*   TO CLEAR THE SCREEN.  HENCE, WE ACTUALLY END UP USING:
*
*        TM    OSBITS,X'93'        MVS/XA OR LATER?
*        BO    SETMDOFF            YES, JUMP TO FAST EXIT
*
*   BUT, THIS IS FIXED BY PTF, SO BACK TO:

         BO    SETMDOFF            YES, JUMP TO FAST EXIT
*
*   ALSO NOTE THAT THE RESET FUNCTION OF ERASE/WRITE, ERASE/WRITE
*   ALTERNATE OR THE CLEAR KEY IS REQUIRED.  A TPUT TO NULL OUT THE
*   SCREEN BUFFER IS INSUFFICIENT.  FULLSCREEN PROGRAMMERS SHOULD
*   ALSO BE AWARE THAT THE CLEAR BUTTON RESETS THE SCREEN SIZE TO
*   THE PRIMARY SIZE (USUALLY 24 BY 80) AND IT IS UP TO THE APPLIC-
*   ATION PROGRAM TO SEND OUT AN ERASE/WRITE ALTERNATE TO CORRECT
*   THE SCREEN SIZE IF APPROPRIATE.  UNDER TSO, THE TMP HANDLES CLEAR
*   UNLESS THE TSO APPLICATION USES THE "STTMPMD ON,KEYS=ALL" MACRO.

*
*        FOR AN IBM OS, IF THE TERMINAL CAN HANDLE IBM 3270 EDS (AND
*   THE CONTROLLER CAN HANDLE A QUERY) THEN SET THE QUERY BIT ON.
*   (IN FACT, QUERY IS A CONTROLLER FUNCTION, SO SET IT ON EVEN FOR
*   "OLD" TERMINALS ON "MODERN" CONTROLLERS.)  IF NOT, THEN DON'T.
*   UNDER FUJTISU'S MSP, IF THE GEAR CAN HANDLE 668X EDS THEN SET
*   THE QUERY BIT ON BECAUSE FUJITSU S/W WILL USE THE ORDER CODES FOR
*   THEIR HARDWARE.  IF 3270 GEAR IS CONNECTED DON'T SET THE QUERY BIT
*   ON BECAUSE THE 3270 MAY SAY IT CAN HANDLE EXTENDED COLORS AND HIGH-
*   LIGHTING (FOR EXAMPLE) BUT CAN THEN NOT UNDERSTAND THE 6680 ORDERS
*   REQUESTING THESE FUNCTIONS, AND DATA STREAM ERRORS RESULT.
*        HOWEVER, IF 3270 COMPATIBLE GEAR IS CONNECTED TO MSP, AND THE
*   APPLICATION (SUCH AS THIS PROGRAM) CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
*   A 3270 QUERY RESPONSE AND A 6680 QUERY RESPONSE, THEN THE QUERY CAN
*   BE ISSUED ANYWAY, AS LONG AS THE APPLICATION THEN SENDS ORDER CODES
*   APPROPRIATE FOR THE HARDWARE DETECTED AT RUN TIME.

*
*         THIS CODE IS ONLY INVOKED WHEN IN CHARACTER MODE (IE.
*         'HEX OFF').  ITS FUNCTION IS TO ATTEMPT TO DISPLAY
*         NON-STANDARD PRIMARY CODE POINTS BY USING THE
*         CORRESPONDING CODE POINTS FROM THE ALTERNATE (IE. APL)
*         CHARACTER SET.  WHEN IN 'FULL ON' MODE THE BYTES TO BE
*         DISPLAYED ARE TRANSLATED THROUGH THE PERIODS TRANSLATE
*         TABLE AND THEN SENT TO THE TERMINAL.  WHEN IN 'FULL OFF'
*         MODE THE BYTES TO BE DISPLAYED UNDERGO EXTRA PROCESSING
*         HERE.
*
*         IF THE DISPLAY BYTES DO NOT HAVE ANY CODE POINTS
*         CORRESPONDING TO THE SUPPORTED APL CHARACTERS THEN
*         THE DISPLAY BYTES ARE SENT TO THE TERMINAL UNCHANGED.
*         OTHERWISE, IF GRAPHIC ESCAPE IS NOT SUPPORTED THEN
*         THESE EXTRA CODE POINTS ARE TRANSLATED TO PERIODS WITH
*         THE "APLOFFT" TRANSLATE TABLE TO PRODUCE AN EFFECT
*         SIMILAR TO THE OLD "KEYBT" TRANSLATION COMMENTED OUT
*         BELOW.
*
*         NOTE THAT SINCE ASCII TERMINALS SUPPORT SQUARE BRACKETS,
*         X'AD' AND X'BD' ARE SENT UNCHANGED.  THIS CHANGE IS
*         PROMPTED BY THE WIDER USE OF THE 'C' PROGRAMMING
*         LANGUAGE WHICH HAS SQUARE BRACKETS IN ITS SYNTAX.
*         SOME TSO HELP MEMBERS AND SOME OF THE NEWER SYSTEM MACROS
*         ALSO CONTAIN SQUARE BRACKETS (AND OTHER APL CHARACTERS)
*         IN THEIR SYNTAX DOCUMENTATION.
*
*         IF GRAPHIC ESCAPE IS SUPPORTED THEN CODE POINTS FLAGGED
*         IN THE "APLT" TABLE HAVE A GRAPHIC ESCAPE INSERTED IN
*         FRONT OF THEM, THUS CAUSING THE CORRESPONDING CODE POINTS
*         FROM THE APL CHARACTER SET TO BE DISPLAYED.
*
*         AS CODED HERE, "ISPF 3278A" BEHAVIOUR IS PERFORMED
*         AUTOMATICALLY IF APL IS SUPPORTED BY THE TERMINAL,
*         WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANY PROFILE SETTINGS.
*
*         CHANGED TO ALLOW "ISPF 3278T" BEHAVIOUR FOR BETTER
*         PRINTOUT AND SYS1.MACLIB ESA MACRO COMMENTS READABILITY.
*         THE 'DISPLAY' SUBCOMMAND CAN BE USED TO CONTROL WHICH
*         DISPLAY CHARACTER SET IS USED.
*
*         IN SUMMARY, 'FULL ON' CAUSES AS MANY CODE POINTS AS
*         POSSIBLE TO BE SENT UNTRANSLATED TO THE TERMINAL FOR
*         DISPLAY FROM THE PRIMARY CHARACTER SET.  'FULL OFF' IS
*         MEANT TO MAXIMIZE THE MEANING OF THE CHARACTERS SHOWN.
*         THIS IS DONE BY JUST SHOWING KEYBOARD-SUPPORTED CHARS,
*         NOW INCLUDING SQUARE BRACKETS (SUPPORTED NATIVELY BY
*         ASCII TERMINALS).  FURTHER, OTHER APL CHARS ARE ALSO
*         INCLUDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE GENERALITY OF THIS CODE AND
*         TO JUST BE PERVERSE.  NOTE THAT THE APL DOWN ARROW (CODE
*         POINT X'8A') CORRESPONDS TO NEW-PAGE FOR RECFM=M.
*
*         THIS CODE IS INVOKED ONE DISPLAY LINE AT A TIME, AND
*         ONLY FOR FILE DATA AND NOT FOR STATUS INFORMATION.

*   THIS ROUTINE IS CALLED ONCE AFTER THE INITIAL SCREENFUL OF
*   RECORDS HAS BEEN READ.  IT DETERMINES IF THE DATA SET BEING
*   REVIEWED IS A ".PCX" OR "ZSOFT PAINTBRUSH" FILE.  IF THE TERMINAL
*   IS NOT SUITABLE TO DISPLAY GRAPHICS THEN NO ACTION IS TAKEN AND
*   "NORMAL" REVIEW PROCESSING CONTINUES.  IF THE DATA PROVES TO NOT
*   BE SUCH A FILE THEN CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO LOGIC WHICH CHECKS
*   FOR A ".BMP" OR "WINDOWS BITMAP" FILE.
*
*   IF IT IS, AND IS A TYPE THAT CAN BE HANDLED BY REVIEW (WHICH
*   PROBABLY MEANS IT WAS NOT WRITTEN BY A RECENT RELEASE OF
*   PAINTBRUSH) THEN THIS ROUTINE STORES THE PICTURE AS ONE BYTE PER
*   PICTURE ELEMENT (OR PIXEL OR PEL) IN AN ARRAY WHICH IS PROCESSED
*   LATER AT SCREEN-FORMAT TIME BY REVIMAGE OR REVNATV OR REVGDDM.
*
*   FOR BLACK-AND-WHITE THE BYTE VALUES ARE:
*          X'00' - BLACK
*          X'01' - WHITE
*
*   FOR COLOUR THE BYTE CONTAINS THE BINARY 3270 COLOUR NUMBER, WHICH
*   IS DERIVED FROM THE APPROPRIATE COLOUR PALETTE ENTRY.  THE HIGH
*   BITS OF THE RGB TRIPLETS ARE RETAINED AND CONVERTED TO 3270 GRB
*   FLAGS FOR THE PIXEL.  THUS, RGB VALUES OF 128 OR MORE TRIGGER THE
*   PRESENCE OF THAT COLOUR FOR THAT PIXEL ON THE TERMINAL.  IT IS
*   OBVIOUS THAT THIS PRODUCES A VERY COARSE COLOUR TRANSLATION.

*   UNLIKE THE CHECK FOR PICTURE CONTENT WHICH TAKES PLACE AFTER
*   THE FIRST SCREENFUL OF RECORDS HAS BEEN READ, THE CHECK FOR
*   A ZIP ARCHIVE TAKES PLACE AFTER THE FIRST RECORD HAS BEEN
*   READ.  THIS IS BECAUSE:
*
*     1. CONVENTIONAL REVIEW DATA DISPLAY MAY BE REQUIRED FOR
*        PICTURES, SUCH AS WHEN 'FMT OFF' IS ISSUED.
*        SO, THE NORMAL REVIEW FILE DATA HANDLING IS REQUIRED.
*        THIS MEANS THERE ARE TWO SOURCES OF DATA RECORDS
*        TO BE CONSIDERED BY THOSE ROUTINES:
*        - THE RECORDS ALREADY READ IN THE HOLD DIRECTORY, AND
*        - RECORDS NOT YET READ FROM THE FILE.
*
*     2. THE ZIP DIRECTORY HANDLER IS GOING TO LOAD DATA INTO
*        "DIV" WHICH WILL THEN BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE FILE TO
*        BE REVIEWED, SO STANDARD REVIEW FILE NAVIGATION WILL
*        NOT BE REQUIRED FURTHER.  THE UNZIPDIR ROUTINE CAN
*        MANAGE ALL THE NECESSARY I/O TO THE FILE WITHOUT
*        ANY NEED TO REFER TO THE HOLD DIRECTORY.
*
*   THIS ROUTINE IS NOT CALLED WHEN THE FILE IS EMPTY.
*
*   ON ENTRY, GPR1 AND GPR2 ARE AS SET BY THE 'GET' ROUTINE
*   AND ARE THE RECORD LENGTH AND RECORD ADDRESS RESPTIVELY,
*   AND GPR4 POINTS TO THE DCB.

*   WITHOUT REPEATING THE TESTS.
*
*   THE "PRINTOUT" FLAG IS $12PRT.
*
*   $12PRT WILL BE SET AUTOMATICALLY UNDER ANY OF THE FOLLOWING
*   CIRCUMSTANCES:
*
*   - THE REVIEW SESSION WAS INITIATED FROM REVOUT.
*   - THE RECORD FORMAT INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF CARRIAGE CONTROL.
*   - THE RECORD FORMAT DOES NOT INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF CARRIAGE
*     CONTROL BUT THE MAXIMUM DISPLAY RECORD LENGTH IS EITHER 121
*     OR 133 BYTES AND THE FIRST DATA BYTE IS EITHER '1' OR X'8B'.
*
*   RTF PROCESSING (WHICH IS ENABLED BY SETTING $12PRT) ASSUMES
*   THAT LRECL IS LESS THAN 256.
*
*     R4 -> DYNDCBW

*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS TO BE CALLED AFTER THE DASD DATA SET HAS
*        BEEN ALLOCATED AND THE USUAL "$" VARIABLES PERTAINING
*        TO THE SUBJECT DATA SET HAVE BEEN LOADED.
*
*        REVDASD PROCESSING CONSISTS OF:
*
*        - FOR ALL DASD DATA SETS:
*          1. OBTAIN THE VTOC ENTRY.
*          2. IF THE OBTAIN FAILS PERFORM A LOCATE TO GET THE
*             REAL DATA SET NAME OF THE DATA SET ALIAS AND
*             RETRY THE OBTAIN.
*          3. IF THE OBTAIN AFTER THE LOCATE FAILS, AND THE FILE
*             IS A MULTI-UNIT FILE, ALLOCATE A NEW FILE TO THE
*             SECOND UNIT AND RETRY THE OBTAIN (IN CASE IT IS A
*             VSAM ALTERNATE INDEX ON A DIFFERENT VOLUME).
*
*        - FOR VSAM DATA SETS:
*          1. DETERMINE WHETHER BSAM OR VSAM IS TO BE USED
*             TO READ THE FILE.
*          2. FOR ICF VSAM, ACCESS THE VVDS TO ACQUIRE RECORD
*             AND KEY DETAILS.
*          3. FOR ICF VSAM, SET UP FOR SHOWING DB2 TABLE ROWS AS
*             RECORDS, BASED ON DATA SET NAME PATTERN MATCHING.
*             DB2 ROW STRUCTURE CONTENT IS VERIFIED LATER BY PHASE 2.
*
*        - FOR NON-VSAM DASD DATA SETS:
*          1. ACQUIRE HARDWARE KEY DETAILS FROM THE VTOC ENTRY.
*          2. CONDITIONALLY PERFORM SAF CHECK TO TEST SECURITY
*             ACCESS BEFORE AN OPEN IS ATTEMPTED.
*               ACCESS LEVEL TESTED IS:
*                 - "ALTER" IF FLAG '$14ALT' IS SET.
*                 - "UPDATE" IF FLAG '$13COMP' IS SET.
*                 - "READ" OTHERWISE.
*          3. DETERMINE IF THE DATA SET IS REALLY A CVOL (SYSCTLG).
*          4. DETERMINE IF THE PDS DIRECTORY ITSELF IS TO BE BROWSED.
*          5. DETERMINE IF "DIV" IS TO BE USED TO STAGE MEMBER
*             CONTENTS.
*          6. DETERMINE IF "FASTPATH" IS TO BE USED TO "SPEED UP" I/O.
