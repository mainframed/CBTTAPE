:h2.Circa 1985 - Initial Implementation
:p.The Schwab Script/VS dialog was developed collectively over a very
short period of time by a systems programmer and a summer intern.  It
was designed to address inadequacies and bugs in the IBM ISPF/PDF 4.9
Script/VS option.
:ul.
:li.The Schwab ISPF dialog replacement consisted of 1,400 lines of
totally
:hp3.
undocumented,
:ehp3.
"spaghetti" CLIST code and about a dozen ISPF panels written for an
early level of TSO/E and ISPF/PDF.
:li.ISPF/PDF option 4.9 was
:hp3.removed:ehp3.
altogether from the option 4 foreground panel until early 1989.
:li.Despite poor support, "S.14", as it became known throughout Schwab,
was the
:hp3.de facto,:ehp3.
panel-driven interface to Script/VS 1.3.0.2 for the next 7.5 years.
:li.Script/VS remained at the 1.3.0.2 level for
:hp1.7 years
:ehp1.
without :hp3.any:ehp3.
IBM corrective service until January, 1992, when Script/VS 1.4.0 was
placed into production.
:li.The old S.14 generated
:hp3.
numerous
:ehp3.
support problems and frustration for end users, help desk personnel, and
systems programmers alike.  The interface alienated many existing and
potential Script/VS users.

:h2.Sophisticated Hardware... But...
:p.In 1985, printing hardware at the corporate offices consisted of
the following printers:
:ul.
:li.IBM 3800-1 (1 printer)
:li.IBM 3820   (9 printers)
:li.IBM 3287   (many !)
:li.IBM 4250   (1 printer)
:li.IBM 6670   (several)
:li.IBM 3205   (1 printer)
:eul.
:p.The printing hardware put in place at that time was advanced and
technically "leading edge".
:p.Unfortunately, application enabling tools, OEM products, and
industry-wide technical expertise in the use of this hardware were
unavailable.

:trfoot left='Publisher''s Workbench'
        center='An ERA of Change'.
:h2.New Printer Technology Debuts
:p.The early '90's marked a renewed interest in printing at Schwab.  New
printing hardware was embraced that provided more sophistication,
reliability, and less operating expense to the corporation:
:ul.
:li.Siemens 2300 and 2140
:li.IBM 3820
:li.ISI 7028 and 7817
:li.IBM 3287
:li.IBM 4224 and 4234
:li.IBM 3205
:li.HP LaserJets and Apple LaserWriters
:li.EPSON 9 and 24-pin printers
:eul.

        &schwablogo
        logopos=right.
:trfoot left='Publisher''s Workbench'
        center='Main Panel Setup'.
:h2.Setting a Skill Level, Printer, and DSNAME
:p.
The Document Composition Facility entry panel consists of 3 basic
sections:
:ul.
:li.Skill-level and Output Device
:li.Choice of Dataset Name
:li.Graphics Preview Using GDDM CDPU
:eul.
:p.
To effectively use S.14.1 and Script/VS the user must understand two
key concepts:
:ol.
:li.Logical vs. real (intended) output devices
:li.Keyword vs. positional parameters on a TSO command
:eol.
.cp
:h2.Basic vs. Advanced Modes
:h3.Basic Mode:  For the Novice, Casual User
:p.
Basic mode is the simplest means by which a user can format a document.
:p.
Simply specify an output device, a DSNAME, depress the Enter key and
document formatting will begin !
:h3.Advanced Mode:  Formatting for the Power User
:p.
The Advanced mode is the most sophisticated means by which you can
control the execution of the Script/VS formatter.  Virtually any keyword
operand can be specified or changed.
:p.
The panel defaults are usually satisfactory for even most power users.
And like Basic mode, when using an Advanced mode panel, just
depress the Enter key and document formatting will begin !
.cp
:h2.12 Logical Device Types
:p.
The Output Device field on the main panel allows the user to select any
one of the following 12 logical devices:
:ul.
:li.
:hp2.TERM :ehp2.or
:hp2.3270::ehp2.
Display output on your presentation device (hardcopy terminal or
CRT).
:li.:hp2.1403::ehp2.
IBM 1403 high-speed, impact line printer or compatible.
:li.:hp2.3800::ehp2.
The IBM 3800-3, Siemens 2300, or Siemens 2140 AFP high-speed, page
printer.
:li.:hp2.PS::ehp2.
Any PostScript or compatible low-speed, desktop page printer.
An Apple LaserWriter or HP LaserJet equipped with Adobe PostScript or
a Pacific Data Products PostScript Emulation Cartridge may be used.
:li.:hp2.3820::ehp2.
Any IBM 3820 or compatible AFP page printer.
:li.:hp2.3812::ehp2.
Any IBM 3812 or compatible mid-range, AFP page printer including the ISI
7028 or 7817 page printer when configured as an IBM 3812.
:li.:hp2.3816::ehp2.
Any IBM 3816 or compatible mid-range, AFP page printer including the ISI
7028 or 7817 page printer when configured as an IBM 3816.
:li.:hp2.4224::ehp2.
Any IBM 4224 or 4234, black or 4-color ribbon printer.
:li.:hp2.4028::ehp2.
Any IBM 4028 or compatible mid-range, AFP page printer including the ISI
7028 or 7817 page printer when configured as an IBM 4028.
:li.:hp2.AFP::ehp2.
Any IBM page printer that supports either 240 or 300 pels SAA Core
Interchange Scalable Font Technology (virtually all IBM page
printers).
:li.:hp2.ISI::ehp2.
This is a "generic" logical device type that matches the default
configuration set on the front panel of any ISI page printer.  It is
currently "hardwired" in the S.14 dialog as an IBM 3816.  All ISI
printers are currently configured to emulate IBM 3816 Page Printers.
However, the Printing Technology Group plans to change the printers to
emulate IBM 4028 Page Printers in the future.  Users will be able to
take advantage of printing at a higher density (and quality) of
300 pels per square inch rather than 240 with the IBM 3816.

:h2.The GDDM CDPU:  Composite Document Printing Utility
:p.
The GDDM CDPU is a utility that is provided as part of IBM's Graphical
Data Display Manager program product.
:p.
The CDPU is a standalone utility that can be used to browse output files
generated by Script/VS for printing upon a 3800, 3820, 3812, 3816, 4224,
4028, and AFP logical devices.
:p.
To browse a document after successful formatting set the 'Preview the
Script output file' option on the main entry panel to
:hp1.
Y.
:ehp1.
You
:hp2.
must
:ehp2.
have the following hardware and/or software to use the CDPU:
:ul.
:li.An IBM display terminal configured to support host graphics.
:li.You must be logged on TSO with graphics active (e.g. TS01M2G,
TS01M3G, TS03M2G, TS03M3G, etc.).
:li.A personal computer configured to support host graphics.
:ul.
:li.OS/2 1.3, 2.0, or 2.1 with GDDM OS/2 LINK (available to all OS/2
users - contact OSVS Technical Services)
:li.EXTRA! for DOS with Host Graphics Option (HGO)
:li.EXTRA! Extended for DOS with Host Graphics Option
:li.EXTRA! Extended for Windows with Host Graphics Option (many bugs !)
:eul.
:eul.
:h3.GDDM User Control and the PA3 key
:p.
Once the CDPU is active, the PA3 key (SHIFT + PageDown when using EXTRA!
with HGO) will activate the GDDM User Control Function, the ZOOM IN/OUT
functions, and mouse support with the graphics cursor ("cross hair").
:h3.Executing the CDPU Outside of S.14
:p.
If a document is kept after Script formatting is complete, the CDPU may
also be invoked from TSO READY, ISPF option 6, or an ISPF command line
by using the CDPU CLIST.
:p.
For example:  %CDPU S14TOUR.LIST3820

:h2.9 Advanced Mode Panels
:p.
Making a choice of any one of the 12 logical device types will display
1 of the 9 Advanced mode device panels.
:p.
The Advanced mode panels were redesigned while following the following
human factors guidelines:
:ul.
:li.Consistent presentation of panel input fields across all Advanced
mode panels.
:li.Logical grouping of panel input fields.
:li.Consistent use of color and highlighting with corresponding text
descriptive of the input field and its use.
:li.Reasonable input field defaults acceptable to a wide audience of
users at varying skill levels.
:li.Meaningful, short and long, pop-up message text.
:li.Boiler-plate tutorial panels accompanying each advanced logical
device panel.
:li.Maintain the "look and feel" of the original application.

:h2.Understanding Advanced Mode Panel Options
:p.All Advanced Mode panels contain the following core set of
options with identical defaults:
:ul.
:li.Binding:  corresponds to the Script/VS
:hp3.BIND:ehp3. keyword parameter.
:li.Change separator pages:  displays the job output separator pages.
:li.Character set 1/2/3/4:  corresponds to the Script/VS
:hp3.CHARS:ehp3. keyword parameter.
:li.Error message controls:  corresponds to the Script/VS
:hp3.MESSAGE:ehp3. keyword parameter.
:li.Spelling verification:  corresponds to the Script/VS
:hp3.SPELLCHK:ehp3. keyword parameter.
:li.Uppercase text output:  corresponds to the Script/VS
:hp3.UPCASE:ehp3. keyword parameter.
:li.Profile data set:  corresponds to the Script/VS
:hp3.PROFILE:ehp3. keyword parameter.
:li.SCRIPT maclib dsname:  corresponds to the Script/VS
:hp3.LIB:ehp3. keyword parameter.
:li.Other SCRIPT options:  allows specification of other Script/VS
keyword parameters not available as a panel option (e.g.
:hp3.PAGE:ehp3.).

:h2.Exploring Unique Panel Options
:p.Some of the Advanced Mode panels contain options that are unique
to their logical device family.
:p.A feature unique to
:hp3.
all
:ehp3.
logical device families is the ability to specify the name of any member
of the logical device family.  This feature will be explained below in
greater detail.
:ul.
:li.
:hp2.TERM :ehp2.or
:hp2.3270::ehp2.
:ul.
:li.Actual terminal type:  this options allows you to select between a
a hardcopy presentation device (i.e. IBM 2741) or an IBM 3270 display
or functional equivalent.
:eul.
:li.:hp2.1403::ehp2.
:ul.
:li.1403 or STAIRS device:  this options allows you to select any of
the 1403 logical device types or specify STAIRS/VS output.  Note that
STAIRS/VS is not installed at Charles Schwab & Co.
:eul.
:li.:hp2.3800::ehp2.
:ul.
:li.The 3800 is a continuous forms device and does not support duplex
printing.  Rotation of output is necessary in order to obtain a document
that can be read in "portrait" orientation.
:eul.
:li.:hp2.PS::ehp2.
:ul.
:li.ASCII or EBCDIC output:  this option allows you to chose either
ASCII or EBCDIC as the format of your PostScript file.  If EBCDIC is
chosen, the output file will be automatically browsed upon successful
formatting of the document.
:li.Orientation or device:  this option allows you to chose any of 4
possible output orientations or specify any PostScript logical device.
:li.Separation master no.s:  this option allows the user to separate a
page into multiple masters for use in offset printing to produce color
documents or multi-part forms.
:li.PostScript imbed lib:  this option allows you to specify the name
of an imbed library containing host-resident PostScript source code
such as PC clipart.
:eul.
:li.:hp2.3820::ehp2.
:ul.
:li.Duplex hardcopy output:  this option allows you to duplex your
output.  Duplexing is a hardware dependent feature that allows printing
on both sides of a single page.
:li.Page seglib dsname:  this option allows you to specify the name of a
partitioned data set containing a page segment for inclusion in a
document.
:eul.
:li.:hp2.4224::ehp2.
:ul.
:li.Page size or device:  this option allows you to choose a specific
continuous forms page size (typically width dependent) that corresponds
to a given logical device.  Rotation of output is application dependent
and is not a function of the hardware.
:eul.
:li.:hp2.4028:ehp2. and :hp2.AFP::ehp2.
:ul.
:li.The 4028 is a 300 pels device and supports use of the IBM Core
Interchange Fonts.  You are encouraged to use the AFP logical device
type for all of your documents.  The IBM Core Interchange Fonts are
IBM's strategic set of fonts for the future.  They are being provided on
all SAA operating systems and presentation devices to maximize
interoperability.  They are a key component of IBM's strategy of 'Print
and View Anywhere'.
