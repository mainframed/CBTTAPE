 The previous panel can be displayed to permit the IBM PC File Transfer Program
 to function while still running ISPF on your TSO screen.

 The transmission of data is initiated from the%PC session+using the%SEND+PC
 command (to send data from the PC to MVS/TSO) or the%RECEIVE+PC command (to
 receive data on the PC from MVS/TSO).  Issuing the command causes a command to
 be automatically issued in the TSO session; the PC and TSO sessions then pass
 the data between them on the TSO screen (although it doesn't appear there
 afterwards).

 Press the%END+key to return to the previous panel and begin the file transfer
 operation.
