  ALL OF OUR USERMODS ARE IN MVS.OSMAINT.USERMODS ON THE TECPLEX.

  Each usermod(LSES5**) member has a corresponding member suffixed with
  a "J".  The members with the "J" suffixes are sample jcl install
  members.

  It is customary to transfer a PDS such as this in tso xmit format -
  to create the xmit format dataset, use the following command -
   "xmit n32.t0sm0,outdsname('t0sm0.xmit.jes2mods'),dataset('t0sm0.tso.
    jes2mods")
  where t0sm0.xmit.jes2mods is an fb 80X3120 dataset, and
  where t0sm0.tso.jes2mods is the pds to be sent.
  Be sure to transfer the file, type=binary when sent via e-mail.
