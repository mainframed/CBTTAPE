Collection of REXX execs and CLISTS from the libraries of the late
  Anthony Forte.

Preface.  Tony Forte was a colleague of ours at the Department of
          Information Technology and Telecommunications of New York
          City (DoITT) who passed away recently at a young age.
          I knew that he had written many useful REXX execs and
          CLISTs, but in his lifetime, I did not take much time
          to explore them.  After his recent untimely passing, I
          took a look at his libraries to see what I could find.
          The following list is a beginning to this collection.
          I hope that I will be able to test more of his things
          and add more later.
