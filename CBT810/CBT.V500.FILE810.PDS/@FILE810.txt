//***FILE 810 is from Richard L. Rice and contains his ONSCREEN     *   FILE 810
//*           package, which is his complete reworking of his file  *   FILE 810
//*           browser package called FM (File Manager) that is on   *   FILE 810
//*           CBT File 745.   This package is completely original,  *   FILE 810
//*           although it has features that were suggested by the   *   FILE 810
//*           REVIEW program from File 134.                         *   FILE 810

//*           The idea here is to create a flexible file browser    *   FILE 810
//*           package which is customizable.  The reason for the    *   FILE 810
//*           rename from FM, is that FM sounded too much like a    *   FILE 810
//*           utility for pre-formatting datasets, rather than a    *   FILE 810
//*           data viewer.                                          *   FILE 810

//*           This package now has a built-in code disassembler.    *   FILE 810
