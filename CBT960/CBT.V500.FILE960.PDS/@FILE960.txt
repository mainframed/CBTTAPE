//*     combination of needing to solve a problem for work,         *   FILE 960
//*     curiosity in how things work, and inspiration for others    *   FILE 960
//*     (both their ideas and their code).  Much of the code I      *   FILE 960

//*     Why did I implement these solution in REXX?  It             *   FILE 960
//*     interfaces with almost every sub-system on zOS, has a       *   FILE 960
//*     huge number of capabilities/APIs, and is easily             *   FILE 960
//*     extensible.  Most of my solutions use REXX & JCL to         *   FILE 960
//*     extend the capabilities of the sub-systems I already have   *   FILE 960
//*     access to, to fill in a missing piece of the automation     *   FILE 960
