//*    I converted many of the LIST*** REXXes to FB-80, so I        *   FILE 220
//*    could include them in my SYSPROC concatenation which is      *   FILE 220
//*    FB-80, as opposed to VB-255.  They are here in this          *   FILE 220
//*    member called REXXES, which is really a PDS in IEBUPDTE      *   FILE 220
//*    (PDSLOAD) format, for your use and pleasure.  These are      *   FILE 220
//*    really valuable and easily installable tools, to help        *   FILE 220
//*    you (or the auditors) to get a better insight into the       *   FILE 220

//*    The REXXes that I have not yet converted, are the ones       *   FILE 220
//*    which don't seem to work right under z/OS 1.13               *   FILE 220
//*    (although I may have missed one or two which do work).       *   FILE 220

//*    Lee Conyers (who has passed on) was really an expert         *   FILE 220
//*    auditor and he knew a lot about what makes the system        *   FILE 220
//*    tick, especially in those areas that an auditor has to       *   FILE 220
//*    watch.  It is a pleasure to be able to use his               *   FILE 220
//*    excellent tools.  That is why I have tried to make them      *   FILE 220

//*    For the record, SHOWzOS on CBT File 492 (load module         *   FILE 220
