History


" 1960-1970 Punch card/batch processing

" 1970-1975 Time Sharing Option (TSO) on line-oriented terminal
  devices

" 1975-1980 Structured Programming Facility (SPF) on visual
  display devices supporting screen oriented devices- The
  "structured" being derived from the powerful editor, which
  supported several commands for structuring source text- In
  addition, SPF offered full-screen support for the program
  development environment- Although SPF was only available as a
  complete package, dialog applications were developed using the
  dialogue support functions-

" 1981-These dialogue support functions were officially released
  as the Dialog Manager- The original SPF becoming the Program
  Development Facility (PDF)

" 1982 - Dialog Manager and Program Development Facility became
  two separate packages, with Dialog Manager being part of ISPF and
  PDF running as an application of ISPF- The Dialog Manager and
  ISPF have become synonymous- Most literature uses ISPF to refer
  to the Dialog Manager components-

" Version 3 brought limited workstation-like functionality in the
  form of pop-up windows and pull-down menus- The DTL (Dialog Tag
  Language) was introduced as alternative means of creating
  dialogue panels-

" Version 4 provided GUI (Graphical User Interface) that
  permitted a simple porting of the user-interface for mainframe
  applications to a workstation- ISPF and ISPF/PDF were combined to
  form a single product, ISPF- However, ISPF/PDF is still
  considered to be the program development interface (editor,
  Compilation, dialogue, etc-)

2- Display all active/stacked LIBDEF definitions

" ISPLIBD


3- Items of Interest

" Allocating an ISPF profile library is not permitted using
  LIBDEF, because ISPPROF contains user-related data-
" Specifying DATASET() is the preferred method because it
  equivalent to an ALLOCATE command-
" LIBDEF are good for the duration of the TSO session or when it
  is removed with the null LIBDEF command-
" When a LIBDEF has been defined and another LIBDEF request is
  issued the second definition takes precedence over the first-
" Each concatenated data set must have the same record format
  (RECFM) and logical record length (LRECL)-
" The LIBDEF ISPLLIB library definitions are not searched by MVS
  member searches caused by the execution of ATTACH, LINK, LOAD, or
  XCTL macros within the selected program (SELECT PGM)- The LIBDEF
  library definitions are searched for selected commands (SELECT
  CMD)-
" Panel datasets can be have a logical record length of 80 or 132

LOG    - Write a message to the ISPF log dataset-
SETMSG - Set a message


2- Setting Messages

GETMSG  MSG(messageid)
SETMSG  MSG(messageid)
LOG     MSG(messageid)
DISPLAY MSG(messageid)
TBDISPL MSG(messageid)
TRANS   MSG=messageid
VER     MSG=messageid
Panel  -MSG=messageid


3- Items of Interest

" Be sure to have "NUMBER OFF"- If you have sequence numbers in
  cols 73 through 80 you will not be able to display your message-
" Continuation character is the "+"-
" Comments can be inserted with /* starting in column 1
" The message identifier and the long message text must start in
  column 1
" When using quotes, they must be single quotes-
" Variables can be placed inside quotes, e-g- 'ISSUE NO &TICKET'-
  Normal substitution will occur-
" Each logical message defined in a member may be separated from
  one another by using one or more blank lines or a comment (/*)
  starting in column 1-
" If no short message is defined, the long message is displayed-
" Variables must start with & character and be 1-8 characters in
  length-
" Cannot use REXX arrays-


4- Items of Interest (cont-)

" A period separates a variable from a concatenated literal- For
  example, &VAR-NOWAY; NOWAY is appended to the current value of
  VAR-
" If an explicit message is specified for the panel display, that
  message takes precedence over any messages set by SETMSG service-
" If the message contains symbolic variables, substitutions are
  made using the values for the variables at the time of
  invocation, not at the point of display-
" DISPLAY MSGID ON will display the MSGID number-
" A special case of message definition is a message which does
  not have any text:
    ó TEST001
    ó ' '
  This dummy message can be used where message processing is
  required but no message text is to be displayed, e-g- it can be
  used to force a panel redisplay-
" To avoid having to define a large number of messages a
  generalized message "torso" containing symbolic variables may be
  defined:
    ó APPL001 '&SMSG' -ALARM=&ALARM
    ó '&LMSG'
  The three symbolic variables &SMSG, &LMSG and &ALRM are replaced
  by the appropriate text for "short message", "long message" and
  alarm condition (ON or OFF), respectively, when the message is
  displayed- You must weigh the advantages and disadvantages
  compared with a larger repository of fixed messages-


5- Examples

" Continuation character is the "+"- Cannot continue lines in the
  )BODY section-
" A literal defined within apostrophes can be continued on the
  following line by setting "+" at the end of the line to be
  continued, the literal continues at the first non-blank character
  on the following line (blanks up to the "+" on the continued line
  are retained)- The below literal is equivalent to 'ALPHA BETA':
    'ALPHA    +
                        BETA'
" Blank characters at the end of a literal are ignored- If,
  however, the literal contains only a single blank character, this
  one is retained- Also, imbedded blank characters are retained-
  For example:
    ó 'ALPHA       '        equal to 'ALPHA'
    ó 'ALPHA     BETA'                      the blanks are retained
    ó 'ALPHA '     retains the 1 blank character
" Comments are inserted with /* comment */- Comments can not be
  in the )BODY, )MODEL or )AREA sections-
" When using quotes, they must be single quotes-
" When using large tables you may need to increase your TSO
  REGION size
" Variables must start with & character and be 1-8 characters in
  length-
" Cannot use REXX arrays-
" Always use &ZCMD as the COMMAND==> variable- This will allow
  for execution of ISPF and external commands-
" Control variables, ones that start with a period, can only be
  used in the logic sections of a panel - )ABCINIT, )INIT, )REINIT,
  )ABCPROC, and )PROC-
" DISPLAY PANELID ON will display the panel name in the upper
  left hand corner of the screen-
" Ensure "NUMBER OFF", panels use all characters in the line- If
  sequence numbers are in the panel a severe error will occur upon
  displaying of the panel-
" After modifying a panel you must refresh it by logging out of
  ISPF or invoking it through ISPF 7-2 (Dialog Test)-
" ISPF panels do not include any arithmetic operations
  (e-g- &N = &N + 1)-
  This must be accomplished within the REXX program-
" ISPF panels do not support DO loop or SELECT statements-
" If you displayed the panel, via REXX, and later you modify the
  panel, you'll need to logoff TSO or use ISPF 7-2 (Dialog Test) to
  refresh the panel in memory- ISPF interprets/compiles the panel
  and saves it in your TSO session in hopes of speeding up future
  displays of the same panel-
" When using "WINDOW(width,depth)" keyword on the )BODY statement
  the minimum width is 8 and depth is 1- The maximum width is 3
  bytes less then the screen width (ex- 80-byte screen, max width
  would be 77)- One byte is used by the attribute character, the
  other two bytes by the "|"-

Display Commands


1- DISPLAY

" Specifically used for displaying data entry panel, not
  selection menus-
" Any ISPF return code of 12 or higher normally causes ISPF to
  exit the dialog- If an application needs to retain control, then
  the statement "CONTROL ERRORS RETURN" would allow you to do so-
" After DISPLAYing a panel the REXX should check for a RC=8- This
  would indicate the customer responded with END or RETURN-
" When DISPLAYing a PANEL you can specify the CUROR and CSRPOS,
  just beware the panel definition takes precedent- If it is not
  specified on the DISPLAY command or in the panel the cursor will
  default to the first input field and cursor position will default
  to 1-


2- ADDPOP / REMPOP

" If you use ADDPOP, ensure to invoke REMPOP after displaying the
  panel- If you do not all panels there after will be displayed in
  Window format-


3- SELECT

" Specifically used for displaying of selection menus or calling
  a function (REXX program or executable program)- Not used for
  displaying data entry panels-


4- TBDISPL

" See section on Table Services

Panel Sections



1- )PANEL

" Optional
" Indicates that the panel is to be displayed in CUA mode and
  specified the associated key list-


2- )ATTR

" Optional
" Defines those special characters (attribute bytes) which are to
  be used to identify field types in the )BODY section-
" SKIP(OFF) is the default- To automatically advance to the next
  input field use specify SKIP(ON)- This prevents customers from
  having to use the tab key-
" INTENS(NONE) is used to hide passwords-
" PAD(_) is used to display the entire length of the input field
  to the customer-
" JUST(LEFT) is the default- Sometimes its more desirable to have
  numbers right justified by specifying JUST(RIGHT)-
" AREA(DYNAMIC) has very little flexibility when it comes to
  processing the panel that no one uses it-


3- )ABC

" Optional
" Action Bar Choice section


4- )ABCINIT

" Required if )ABC section has been specified
" Action Bar Choice Initialization Section
" You must include the "-ZVARS" panel source definition statement
  for each action bar choice section you define-


5- )ABCPROC

" Optional-
" Action Bar Choice Processing section


6- )BODY

" Required
" Define the format and contents of the panel as it will be
  displayed
" Use EXPAND(//) to eliminate typing-  This will duplicate the
  designated character within the '/''s- For example -/-/-, will
  repeat the character for the entire length of the screen-
" Use Z variables for fields with small sizes-  By defining
  -ZVARS = '(var1)' in the )INIT section-
" Can not use comments in this section-


7- )MODEL

" Mandatory for Table Display Panels (TBDISPL), must not be
  present for other panels
" Specifies the display format of one logical row from the
  corresponding ISPF table-
" Minimum of one line and a maximum of 8 lines-
" To limit the number of rows being displayed based on some
  search argument use )MODEL ROW(SCAN)- This would cause the
  TBDISPL service to examine each row to see if it matches the
  arguments set by the TBSARG in the REXX driving the display- Only
  successful matches will be displayed- But you must remember to
  use a TBSARG, for failure to do so will result in a sever error
  when the TBDISP is invoked
" Can contain the following field types:  Input, Output, and Text-
" Can not use comments in this section-


8- )AREA

" Optional
" Scrollable Area section
" Cannot use comments in this section-


9- )INIT

" Optional
" Defines the processing that is to be performed before the panel
  is initially displayed-


10- )REINIT

" Optional
" Define the processing which is to be performed before the panel
  is redisplayed
" A redisplay occurs after an "error" condition has been signaled
  or when the data for a selected row in a table display panel is
  redisplayed-
" A redisplay is invoked under the following circumstances:
    ó The -MSG control variable is non-blank, i-e- a statement in
      the )PROC section has implicitly (using aver or TRANS
      statement) or explicitly (by assignment) set a message-
    ó The DISPLAY or TBDISPL service is used without a panel name
      being specified


11- )PROC

" Optional
" Defines the processing that is to be performed after the panel
  has been displayed-
" Typically is used to validate the input-


12- )PNTS

Those attributes marked with mandatory must be used for the
indicated attribute- Many types (for example, the various text
attributes) can be used at the developer's discretion- Those
marked with an asterisk (*) are not CUA attributes, but are
included for completeness-

Protected means that the contents of that field are protected
against being changed, i-e- the field cannot be used for input-
Text means that the contents of that field are interpreted as
being text data, variable data must be specified as a symbolic
variable (&VAR)- Input and output mean that the following field
is interpreted as being the name of a variable, the contents of
which are placed at this location in the panel display- Output
has only the significance that the displayed field contents
cannot be altered, i-e- the field is only used for output- The
use of DATIN and DATOUT are used in the dynamic field section-



Panel Statements


These statements can be used in the initialization ()ABCINIT,
)INIT, )REINIT) and processing, ()ABCPROC, )PROC) sections-


1- Assignment

" The literals '' and ' ' both represent a single blank- The
  system variable &Z must be used to set the null variable (X'0')-
  No arithmetic statements are allowed-


2- EXIT

" IF (-RESP = END) EXIT


3- GOTO

" The label statement is 1-8 characters, the first character must
  be alphabetic- Lower case letters are translated to uppercase-


4- IF (ELSE)

" Relational Operators
ó EQ, NE, GT, GE, LT, LE, NG, NL
ó =, ~=, >, >=, <, <=, ~>, ~<
" The IF statement has the following limitations:
ó No "THEN" keyword-
ó No "DO-END" groups are allowed- Instead, multiple statements
  dependent on a given IF condition are recognized by the fact that
  they are indented from the IF statement-
ó The comparison must be enclosed in parenthesis, ie- IF (&X = 1)
" IF (&ABC = 1, 2, 3) EXIT


5- PANEXEIT (Panel Exit)

" The use of the panel exit in its current form cannot be recommend-


6- REFRESH

" Normally the panel fields are not updated when the panel is
  redisplayed, meaning the fields have the same value as when you
  last saw them- Refresh forces the specified variables in the
  panel to be updated before redisplay-
" REFRESH is only necessary if the panel is to be redisplayed
  after variables have been modified as a result of processing-
" REFRESH (*), refreshes all panel fields having the attribute of
  input or output-


7- TOG (Toggle)


8- VEDIT (variable edit)


9- VER (verify)

" Although NONBLANK test can be combined with other verification,
  it may be preferable to make a separate test and so produce a
  more explicit message-
" Note, no important verification is performed on a blank field,
  although the NONBLANK parameter may be used to force input to be
  made to the field in question-
" The standard message test associated with the LIST keyword is
  not very useful; the long message merely states "ENTER ON OF THE
  LISTED VALUES" without explaining what the listed values are- In
  this instance it is better for the developer to issue his own
  message that contains a list of the valid operands-


10- VGET


11- VPUT



Panel Variables


1- ZSEL

A-     The following contents are interpreted in a special manner

"  "   (blank) the message "ENTER OPTION" is displayed

"?"    (question mark) the message "INVALID OPTION" is displayed


B- Example

&ZSEL = TRANS(TRUNC(&ZCMD,'-')
    1, 'CMD(%REXXPGM)'
    2, 'PGM(COBOLPGM)'
    3, 'PANEL(PANEL1)'
    X, EXIT
    ' ', ' '
    '*', '?')

In the above example if the customer does not type any characters
in and presses ENTER the message "ENTER OPTION" will appear-

If the customer types in any other character than 1, 2, 3, or X
the "INVALID OPTION" message will be displayed-


Panel Functions


1- TRUNC

A- Description
" Enables you TRUNCate a string either at a fixed position or at
  the occurrence of a given character-

B- Syntax
" &VAR1 = TRUNC(<variable>, ## | 'char')

C- Examples
" &X = 'ABC-DEF'
" &A = TRUNC(&X, 3)  Contains ABC
" &B = -TRAIL   Contains -DEF
" &C = TRUNC(&X, '-')  Contains ABC
" &D = -TRAIL   Contains DEF

D- Items of Interest
" -TRAIL contains the remainder of the string-


2- TRANS

3- Description
" Enables you translate one string into another at the same time
  making provisions for an error message if a match cannot be
  found-

4- Syntax
" &VAR1 = TRANS(<variable>, value,value - MSG=id)

5- Examples
" &A = TRANS(&OPT  A,ADD,  C, CHANGE,  D,DELETE)
" &B = TRANS(&ANS  Y,YES  N,NO  MSG=DDSM000)
" &C = TRANS(&COD  1,ABC  2,XYZ  *,*)
" &D = TRANS(&ANS  Y,YES  N,NO  *,'?')

6- Items of Interest
  " One very common usage is selection panels:
    ó &ZSEL = TRANS(TRUNC(&ZCMD, '-')  1,'PGM(ABC)' )


3- PFK

A- Description

" Allows us to extract information about the settings of any of
  the Program Function (PF) keys-

B- Syntax
" &VAR1 = PFK(nn, | string)

C- Examples
" &PFVAL = PFK(02)     "SPLIT" is returned
" &PFVAL = PFK('SPLIT')  "PF2" is returned

D- Items of Interest
" If the string is assigned to more than one PF Key, the first
  primary key with the string will be given-


4- LVLINE

A- Description
" Returns the number of the last visible line in this panel for
  an area defined as DYNAMIC or GRAPHIC

B- Syntax
" &VAR1 = LVLINE(<areaname>)


C- Examples
" &A = LVLINE(AREA1)

D- Items of Interest
" This function is not used much-



Panel - Control Variables


1- -ALARM
" Can be annoying to the customer

2- -ATTR
" Can be used to accentuate a field for error processing

4- -CURSOR
" Used to position the cursor on the field in error-
" Once it has been set, it cannot be changed during the current
  panel processing-

5- -HELP
" If -HELP has not been set, the invocation of the help command
  will cause the last set help panel to be displayed- This panel is
  probably unrelated to the current application anc could confuse
  the customer- It is recommended that every panel sets -help to be
  the name of some appropriate help panel for the application-

6- -MSG
" Cannot be changed once it has been set during the current panel
  display-

7- -RESP
" ISPF applications usually adopt the convention that the END key
  terminates the panel display without any input being processed-
  Hence, processing in the )PROC panel display without any input
  being processed- Hence, processing in the )PROC section should be
  performed if the operator has used the ENTER key (or equivalent)
  to terminate the panel display, i-e- all processing in the )PROC
  section should be inside the IF (-RESP=ENTER) group-

8- -ZVARS
" The excessive use of placeholder's results in panels that is
  difficult to maintain- Placeholders should only be used where
  they are necessary, namely where the variable name associated
  with a field is longer than the data it contains-



Date Validation


)BODY
+ Enter Date ==>  _ED+(Day)  _EM+(Month)  _EY+(Year)
+
)PROC
   IF (-RESP = ENTER)
      &EDATE = '&EY&EM&ED'

                VER(&ED,NB,RANGE,01,&MONTHDAY)
)END


The three parts of the input date (ED, EM, and EY are transferred
to the compound field EDATE- If this field is non-blank, at least
one of the input fields has been defined- EY is verified as being
numeric (with leading zero)- EM is verified as being numeric
(with leading zero) and in the range 01 through 12- The
intermediate variable FEB is set initially to 28, should EY be a
leap year, FEB is set to 29- The number o days on the month is
set into MONTHDYA, ED is checked that it lies within the range 01
through MONTHDAY-



ISPPREP


1- Description

" Utility to pre-process (compile) ISPF panels-


2- Pros

" Faster accessing panel, no interpreting or pre-processing is
  needed
" Smaller in size
" Increased protection from someone modifying the panel


3- Cons

" Need to have a separate PDS to save the source-
" One more step added in placing into production-


4- Invoking Utility

" Entering ISPPREP on the ISPF Command line
" SELECT PGM(ISPPREP) PARM(parms--)


5- Items of Interest

" A panel library may contain both pre-processed and
  non-processed panels-
" No way to un-compile a pre-process ISPF panel- Must have source
  code-



Skeletons


1- Skeleton Services

FTOPEN  - Create an output file for file tailoring
FTINCL  - Include a skeleton to control output
FTCLOSE - Close out the file tailoring process
FTERASE - Erase the created output file

2- Two Types of statements

A- Control Statements
" Those with a control character,")", in column 1 and immediately
  followed by a control word- Generally, these are the statements
  that inform the file tailoring process how to interpret the
  contents of the skeleton-

B- Data Statements
" All others, including those that begin with ")" but are
  followed by a blank- These are statements that contain the actual
  data that is to appear in the output file, depending on the
  conditions established by the control statements-

3- Items of Interest

" The member of the file-tailoring library can have a maximum
  record length of 255 bytes; the last 8 characters of the input
  records are ignored-
" Continuation of a line is accomplished by inserting a special
  character ("?" by default) in the column preceding the last eight
  characters, sequence field-
" In the event that an output record generated from the skeleton
  exceeds the specified length of the output file, the file
  tailoring process terminates immediately-
" When using quotes, they must be single quotes-
" Can not be editing the skeleton and executing a REXX that
  "FTINCL" the same skeleton- An ENQ error will occur-

4- Items of Interest (Cont-)

" Variables must start with & character and be 1-8 characters in length-
" Cannot use REXX arrays-
" Large file tailoring may require you to increase your TSO REGION size-
" The FTOPEN without the TEMP parameter requires that the ISPFILE
  be allocated; even when the TBCLOSE uses a different file- That
  is a dummy allocation always must have been made for ISPFILE-
" File tailoring which has been opened with the TEMP parameter
  cannot be stored as a permanent member-
" FTINCL invokes the FTOPEN service (with TEMP parameter) if file
  tailoring services have not been opened-
" The tabbing to a non-existent tab stop causes a run-time error-
" A period delimits a variable name; this delimiter is only
  required when a variable name is immediately followed by a
  literal (either alphanumeric or numeric), e-g- &ALPHA-KOSS or
  &ALPHA-2
" The less than ("<"), break("|"), and greater than (">") define
  a conditional substitution string- For example <&ALPHA|HELP> will
  check the contents of variable ALPHA, if it is null, the
  alphanumeric literal HELP is to be substituted in it's place-


5- Examples

ISPFSKE1 - File tailoring to a temporary file
ISPFSKE2 - File tailoring to a permanent file
ISPFSKE3 - File tailoring using tables and saving to permanent file

" ISPTABL - Output


4- Use of Tables

" Directly processed using table services
" Display using the TBDISPL service (MODEL)
" Data input for file tailoring services (DOT-ENDDOT)


5- Two forms of table operations

" Operations involving the table as a whole
" Row operations



Table Commands


1- Table Services

TBCREATE - Create a table
TBOPEN   - Open a table for processing
TBSORT   - Sort a table
TBQUERY  - Query information about a table
TBSTATS  - Obtain statistical data on the table
TBSAVE   - File a copy of the table and continue
TBCLOSE  - Close a table and disconnect it from use
TBEND    - End processing of a table without saving
TBERASE  - Remove a table from the system (DELETE)


2- Single Row Operations

TBADD    - Add a row to a table
TBDELETE - Delete a row from a table
TBEXIST  - Check existence of a particular key
TBGET    - Retrieve a row in a table
TBMOD    - Modify a row in a table
TBPUT    - Store a row in a table
TBSARG   - Set search arguments for a table scan or display
TBSCAN   - Search for row that matches search argument
TBVCLEAR - Clear table variables to null


3- Row Pointer Operations

TBTOP    - Point to top of table (row 0)
TBSKIP   - Skip to the row following the current
TBBOTTOM - Point to bottom of table (last row)

1- TBADD
" For keyed tables, the table is searched to ensure that the key
  is unique-

2- TBCLOSE
" Deleted the main storage copy of the table-
" If the function (REXX program) using temporary output tables
  terminates without closing the table, a re-invocation of this
  function uses table in main storage- This can lead to duplicate
  rows, etc-

3- TBDISPL
" Used to display and modify rows of table- A more dynamic data
  entry panel-
" Upon return from the TBDISPL call, the 4 character function
  pool variable ZTDSELS will indicate the number of rows selected-
  You will be placed automatically at the first row, while all the
  others will remain pending- As you finish processing the first
  selected row and wish to proceed to the next pending row, you
  simply invoke a TBDISPL with no other parameters except the table
  name- You should repeat this process until &ZTDSELS is
  decremented down to 1, indicating that you are processing the
  last row selected-
" If by chance you need to perform another TBDISPL or just a
  DISPLAY, any pending rows will be ignored and &ZTDSELS will be
  reset- To prevent this you should invoke "CONTROL DISPLAY SAVE"
  (before) and a CONTROL DISPLAY RESTORE (after), so that your
  environment will be preserved for correct processing-
" A table display panel is subject to certain constraints:
ó A table display panel must have a )MODEL section which defines
  the display from a single row, the table name is specified as a
  parameter to the TBDSIPL service- The MODEL section may contain
  up to 8 lines-
ó A table display panel should have a command field in the panel-
ó A table display panel should have an input field containing the
  scroll amount as the second input field containing the scroll
  amount as the second input field in the panel- This field must be
  at least 4 characters in length-
" The information that is displayed is not restricted to what can
  fit on a single screen, but may be scrolled vertically-
" Variables in the )MODEL line can come from either or both the
  table and the variable pools; the table variable has priority
  over the pool variables-
" If no panel name is specified, the current (TBDISPL) panel is
  redisplayed
" Redisplay takes one of two forms, depending on whether
  selections are pending- If selections are pending, the data for
  the selected row are returned in the corresponding function pool
  variables and no physical display takes place- If no selections
  are pending, no data is retuned but any outstanding scroll
  request is processed and a physical display takes place-

4- TBOPEN
" The simplest means of determining whether a table is present is
  to use the TBOPEN services and test its return code (0=table
  present, 8=table not present-

5- TBSARG/TBSCAN
" When TBSARG is used in a loop, care must be taken to ensure
  that the search argument values contain the true comparand and
  not those read from the last table row-
" Also, those variables not being used should be set to null
  using the TBVCLEAR service prior to invoking the TBSARG/TBNSCAN
  service-

6- TBSAVE
" Should be regularly used during long running applications to
  maintain an up to date permanent copy of the table as this
  facilitates recovery should the computer system fail-

7- TBSORT
" A sorted table (even an empty table) is maintained in this
  specified sequence, provided all subsequent requests effecting
  the position of rows (TBADD, etc-) specify the ORDER parameter-

8- TBSTATS
" The table need not be open to obtain statistical information-



TBDISPL Variables


The bracketed entry that follows each description has the form:
[length, type, pool], although some entries are omitted- If the
type is omitted, it is read-only


ZTDADD    More rows needed to satisfy scroll request
          (YES|NO) [3, out, func]

ZTDAMT    Number of rows needed to satisfy scroll [3, out, func]

STDLROWS  Number of rows in the logical table [6, in, func]

ZTDLTOP   Map current top row in physical table to its position
          in logical table [6, in, func]

ZTDMARK   User-defined bottom-of-data text [in]

ZTDMSG    User-defined message-id for top of table [8, in]

ZTDRET    [8, in, func]

ZTDROWS   Number of displayed table rows [6, out, func]

ZTDSCRP   CRP of top row to be displayed after scroll [6, i/o, func]

1- Items of Interest

" The table structure (Temp or Perm) is determined when the table
  is created and can only be changed by recreating the table-
" The input library definition (ISPTLIB) may specify a
  concatenation of libraries, where as the output library
  definition (ISPTABL) may only specify a single library-
" ISPTABLE is not required for temporary files-
" Although two separate library definitions are required (ISPTLIB
  and ISPTABL), it is important that these refer to the same
  physical library- Should this not be the case, then the table
  being updated is not the input table (this is a common cause of
  error)-
" For reasons of data consistency a table which is used for
  output can only be used (opened) by one user- The mechanism of
  ENQ (lock) and DEQ (unlock) is used to control table access-
  There is no restriction of the number of users for tables that
  are opened for input (read)-
" Services which use the output table library can also specify a
  file name other than ISPTABL
" All table operations, except TBCREATE, TBERASE, TBOPEN and
  TBSTATS, require that the table be open-
" Row operations, except TBADD, either positions the current row
  pointer (CRP) at a specific row or process the row where the CRP
  is positioned-
" Note each row may be assigned additional variables, called
  extension variables-
" Keyed tables are accessed by key value, non-keyed tables are
  accessed by row number-
" The table may be shared between logical screens when the user
  is in split screen mode- The table may only be created from one
  logical screen-
" It is important to explicitly check the line operator
  (U-update, D-delete, etc--)-
  There is no means of explicitly un-selecting a line in the
  TBDISPL display-
  A line remains selected once it has been selected-
  If the selection code is invalid it remains selected once it
  has been selected-
  If the selection code is invalid it can only be "de-selected"
  by overwriting the selection code with a blank- The selection,
  however, is passed to the processing routine-
  It is the responsibility of the processing routine-
  It is the responsibility of the processing routine to ignore
  such "non-selections"-

TABLE02  - Create/display a table using data from an array
TABLE03  - Display/modify  a keyed table
TABLE04  - Use a table and skeleton for SYSIN cards for an IEBCOPY-

BATCH

1- Items of Interest

" When an ISPF application runs in batch, any panel displays must
  either be suppressed with "CONTROL NONDISPLAY END) or by setting
  the -RESP control variable or the panel command field to END
  within the panel-

" Any input that normally would have been entered on the
  displayed panel must be made by setting the appropriate dialog
  variables

" To set the Return Code:
    ADDRESS ISPEXEC
    ZISPFRC = 8
    "VPUT (ZISPFRC)"
