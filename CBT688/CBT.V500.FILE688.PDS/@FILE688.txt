//***FILE 688 is from Larry Altman and contains a slightly          *   FILE 688
//*           modified REXX program from Larry Prestosa, called     *   FILE 688
//*           RCNGNINT.  This program can be used to generate DBRC  *   FILE 688
//*           INIT commands in order to transfer database           *   FILE 688
//*           registration information from one recon to another    *   FILE 688
//*           or to create database registration commands which     *   FILE 688
//*           may have been lost.  It has been used with IMS V6     *   FILE 688
//*           and V7 RECONs.                                        *   FILE 688
