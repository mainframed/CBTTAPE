  THE SYSLOG YOU WISH TO BROWSE CAN BE SELECTED BY TYPING AN 'S' NEXT TO
  THE PROPER CREATION DATE.  KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CREATION DATE IS USUALLY
  ONE DAY AFTER THE DATE OF THE SYSLOG.  (I.E. IF YOU WISH TO BROWSE THE
  SYSLOG FOR 84.107, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK AT THE ONE WITH A CREATION
  DATE OF 84.108.)
