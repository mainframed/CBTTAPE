 Panel Displays
 --------------

 ISL communicates with you through a series of panels.  A PANEL is a prede-
 fined display image that is presented on a display terminal.  Panels may re-
 quire a response, and that response is used to determine the next panel to
 be displayed on the function to be performed.  Your responses may be in up-
 percase or lowercase.
