.us Online Terminal Support
.sp
.sr onterm=%
SCRIPT has enhanced support for Online ASCII terminals.
In particular this support would be most useful for
hardcopy terminals using the 'Diablo' print mechanism.
For such terminals, if the user includes terminal escape
codes as part of the document, then these escape codes
will be retained within the text without confusing the
justification algorithm.
.sp
For terminals supporting a Negative Line Feed it will
be used to support the SPace zero or Don't Count control words.
If the user makes use of the Null Character (X'00'),
TN superscripts and box drawing characters
or ALA subscripts, these will be altered to the appropriate
escapes and printable characters for the terminal.
For multiple column output SCRIPT uses the absolute
Horizontal Tabbing facility of the terminal.
And lastly, SCRIPT will take advantage of the variable
Horizontal Motion Index feature to display output
from 4 to 18 characters per inch and will generate
proportional interword spacing codes.

NOTE: This version of SCRIPT has not solved the problem
of Output Overlay and the vertical sides of Boxes.
These characters may be incorrectly placed in formatted
text because of the variable width of the interword blanks.

But all of this comes at a price.
New positional and keyword parameters must be specified
in order to make use of the facilities of the terminal.
.sp
CPInch=<10|n>
.in +4
This parameter specifies the horizontal
number of characters per inch for ONline output.
For this to have any effect, the Horizontal Motion
Index (HMI) must be defined for the terminal.
The default CPI is 10, but may range from 4 to 18.
.in -4
.sp
.cp 5
X1
.in +4
This positional parameter defines the output terminal
to be a XEROX 1620 diablo terminal.
SCRIPT makes use of the HMI, Negative Line Feed,
Superscript, Subscript and absolute Tabbing features
of the terminal.
.in -4
.sp
.cp 5
MULTI3
.in +4
This positional parameter defines the output terminal
to be an Ahearn and Soper Multiwriter III terminal.
It is currently defined identical to the X1620.
The terminal however will do backward typing and horizontal
tabbing to optimize the speed of output.
.in -4
.sp
.cp 5
QUME
.in +4
This positional parameter defines the output
terminal to be a QUME terminal.
Currently it is defined with none of the attributes
that SCRIPT requires for enhanced output.
The function codes are known to be different from the X1620
but what they are exactly is not known for this
version of SCRIPT.
.in -4
.sp
.cp 5
ASISterm
.in +4
This positional parameter defines an output terminal
that knows nothing about escape characters and special
characters such as Superscripts and Subscripts.
.in -4
.sp
.cp 5
MYTERM
.in +4
This positional parameter defines the output terminal
to an installation dependent terminal.
By default this parameter defines a 2741 type of terminal
that cannot do any of the features described above.
Special characters are simulated on such a terminal however.
