//***FILE 898 is a good deal of the life work of Alex Kara.  We     *   FILE 898

//*     THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY HANDY TOOLS HERE, many of them      *   FILE 898
//*     being quite rare in their functionality.  Alex has spent    *   FILE 898
//*     a lot of time inventing them.  Please look especially at    *   FILE 898
//*     dataset $$ (member list $$MEM) for really good REXX execs   *   FILE 898

//*     Background Discussion of Contents  -  from Alex Kara        *   FILE 898
//*     ---------- ---------- -- --------                           *   FILE 898
//*                                                                 *   FILE 898
//*     Just recently I got a tad nostalgic and thought that it     *   FILE 898
//*     would be a shame to let my 35+ years of experience as       *   FILE 898
//*     an appo and sysprog slide into the bit bucket.              *   FILE 898
//*                                                                 *   FILE 898
//*     My experience covered close to 20 years of contracting      *   FILE 898
//*     where I've had contracts for long and short periods at      *   FILE 898
//*     small and large sites (including IBM and CSC).              *   FILE 898
//*     Consequently I have amassed a swag of both handy (and       *   FILE 898
//*     not so handy) routines that I cannot pass on to an          *   FILE 898
//*     understudy/apprentice.  Because of the multiple site        *   FILE 898
//*     support I often had to update my routines as I aimed        *   FILE 898
//*     for generic or easily customisable solutions. As a          *   FILE 898
//*     result I have developed the nasty habit of placing          *   FILE 898
//*     everything into one dataset for the ease of moving that     *   FILE 898
//*     big one around.  I have kept names unique so the            *   FILE 898
//*     dataset contains all my REXX, CLIST, Panels, Skeleton       *   FILE 898
//*     and Message members and a few occasional doco etc..  I      *   FILE 898
//*     do keep a separate dataset for the load library             *   FILE 898
//*     (however, if only 1 or 2 module have changed  I often       *   FILE 898
//*     XMIT that member(s) into an FB=80 dataset and store         *   FILE 898
//*     that as a member in the above catch all and ship).   I      *   FILE 898
//*     hate typing and as it is a catch all I call it              *   FILE 898
//*     'userid.$$' so it is at the top of the DSlist under 3.4     *   FILE 898
//*     and readily accessible).   I identify each member in        *   FILE 898
//*     the $$$INDEX member with a brief 1 line description and     *   FILE 898
//*     with my LINEMAC commands readily edit members from that     *   FILE 898
//*     $$$INDEX member.   This $$ dataset is allocated at the      *   FILE 898
//*     front of all the respective ISPF/SYSEXEC                    *   FILE 898
