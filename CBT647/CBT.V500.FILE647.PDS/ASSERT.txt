** NAME     - ASSERT                                                 **

** FUNCTION - Unit test assertion plumbing.                          **
**                                                                   **

** NOTES    - 1. You will have to either append the ASSERT rexx code **
**               manually to your Rexx source, or run your Rexx      **
**               source through the REXXPP rexx pre-processor.       **
**                                                                   **
**               To use the pre-processor, run:                      **
**                                                                   **
**               rexxpp yourrexx xyz                                 **
**                                                                   **
**               ...and then run the resulting 'xyz' rexx procedure: **
**                                                                   **
