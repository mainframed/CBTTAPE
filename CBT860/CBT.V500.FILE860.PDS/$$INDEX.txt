This file (860) contains (mostly) assembler programs without JCL.
File 861 contains most macros required for proper assembly.
File 862 contains additional files with procedures, parmlib data,
  and other supporting material. It also contains auxiliary macros,
  as PVTMACS, once available from IBM on optional source material
  tapes. Some macros not available have been concocted from dumps or
  IBM documentation.
