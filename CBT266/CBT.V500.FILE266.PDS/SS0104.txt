*     FIXED A BIT BY SAM GOLOB:  DECEMBER 18, 2012                    *
*                                                                     *
*       1.  INCREASED TOTAL FOOTAGE TO READ FIVE DIGITS (10000.0 FT)  *
*           ALSO INCREASE FILE FOOTAGE SIMILARLY.                     *
*                                                                     *
*       2.  SUBSTITUTED "TODAY" ROUTINE FOR "WKDATE" ROUTINE.         *
*           WKDATE DID NOT GIVE THE CORRECT TIME AFTER MY FIRST FIX.  *
*           BUT "TODAY" IS BETTER, BECAUSE IT ADDITIONALLY REPORTS    *
*           THE JULIAN DATE.                                          *

*              FOR STANDARD LABEL TAPES, ALL INFORMATION DISPLAYED    *
*              FOR EACH FILE IS TAKEN FROM THE LABELS.  THE VOLUME    *
*              SERIAL IS TAKEN FROM THE VOL1 HEADER RECORD, AND THE   *
*              DENSITY DISPLAYED IN THE HEADER IS THE TRUE TAPE       *
*              RECORDING DENSITY.  A CHECK IS MADE TO SEE IF THE FILE *
*              SEQUENCE NUMBER AND DENSITY CODE TAKEN FROM THE LABEL  *
*              ARE CORRECT.  IF NOT, THEY ARE BRACKETED BY ><.  THE   *

*              FOR NON-LABELLED TAPES, THE PROGRAM ATTEMPTS TO        *

*                                                                     *

*                   HALFWORD OF EACH BLOCK IS EQUAL TO THE LENGTH OF  *
*                   THE BLOCK.  IF NOT, BUT ALL RECORDS ARE THE SAME  *
*                   LENGTH, OR ONLY THE LAST BLOCK IS SHORT, THE      *
*                   RECORD FORMAT IS INDICATED AS F (THIS IS ACTUALLY *
*                   FS FORMAT).  THE RECORD FORMAT IS DISPLAYED AS U  *
*                   IF THE ABOVE CONTIDIONS ARE NOT MET.              *
*                                                                     *

* 05/28/04     GOT RID OF THE CNTRL MACRO FOR SL TAPES, AND READ      *
*              THROUGH THE DATA AT NORMAL SPEED INSTEAD.  IN SOME     *
*              MVS SYSTEMS, THIS USAGE OF THE CNTRL MACRO CAUSED      *
*              AN I/O ERROR.  I FIGURED THAT MODERN TAPE DRIVES       *
*              ARE FASTER, ANYWAY.  (SAM GOLOB)                       *

*              ALSO, ONLY MEASURE FOOTAGES AS THOUGH THE TAPE IS      *
*              6250 BPI, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF TAPE YOU PUT INTO     *
*              THE TAPE DRIVE.  THIS STANDARDIZES THE MEASUREMENT.    *

* 12/18/12     FIXED FOOTAGES TO SHOW OVER 10000 FEET.  IN THE        *
*              PROCESS, I MAY HAVE MESSED UP THE CALCULATION OF       *
*              THE EXECUTION TIME, IN THE HEADERS.  TO FIX THAT,      *
*              I SUBSTITUTED A BETTER "DATE/TIME CALCULATION"         *
*              ROUTINE, CALLED "TODAY" (INSTEAD OF THE ONE CALLED     *
*              WKDATE).  THIS ROUTINE "TODAY" INCLUDES THE JULIAN     *
*              DATE AS WELL AS DAY OF WEEK AND FULL DATE.  "TODAY"    *
*              WAS FIXED FOR Y2K BY JOEL C. EWING AND RON TANSKY,     *
*              AND IT APPEARS TO BE WORKING CORRECTLY. (SAM GOLOB)    *

.*                THE ADDRESS OF THE ENTRY POINT, AND SUCCESSIVE BASE *
.*                REGISTER ADDRESSES ARE INCREMENTED BY 4096.  THE    *
.*                DEFAULT BASE REGISTER IS REGISTER 3.  IF REGISTER 2 *
