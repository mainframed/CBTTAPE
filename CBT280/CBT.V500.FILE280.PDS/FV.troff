where optional "n", from 1 to the value of the HSFSOVER option,
gives the even heading line number
and S1, S2 and S3 are character strings _n_o_t
containing quotation marks.  Any of the
fields may be omitted, but the quotation marks
must be included to
indicate missing fields, e.g., 'S1''S3'.
.SUBT Usage
The .FV control word is used in a way similar to the .HE control
word.  The title items defined with .FV
will be printed in a footing line near the bottom of even numbered
pages.  The number of footing lines printed on even pages is set
by .FS (Footing Space).
.SUBT Defaults
A break will not be created when this command
word is encountered and until
then ".fv ''''" will be in effect.
