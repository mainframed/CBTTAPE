)sp
There exists a growing set of basic SCRIPT control words that are
undocumented in this reference guide.  These commands are
undocumented because they are special purpose,
redundant or no longer useful.
Most such control words exist in this version of SCRIPT for
compatibility with other versions of SCRIPT
but some are intended for use only by programmers debugging
a programme function.
)sp
These control words have been omitted from the body of this
Reference Guide in order to make the beginner less overwhelmed
by the quantity of material to be learned.
The objective is a smaller set of control words with common
arguments that are easier to remember and thus easier
to use effectively.
)sp
An example of control words is the ".PA ODD" control word that
ejects to the top of the next odd numbered page.
The other two implementations ".PD" for PAGE ODD and ".OP"
for ODD PAGE are difficult to remember because of infrequent use.
)sp
An example of common arguments is ".FN BEGIN", ".CE YES" and
".SU ON".
For less frequently used control words it can be difficult to
remember which pair to use -- ON/OFF, YES/NO, BEGIN/END or
SAVE/NOSAVE.
Actually, ON, Yes, Begin and SAve are all equivalent positive
operands and OFf, No, End, STop and QUit are all negative
operands.
So if you know ".CE" controls centering of text it doesn't matter
if you enter ".CE YES", ".CE ON" or ".CE B", the function
will be the same.
)sp
Numeric arguments are much the same.
Where possible, the relative argument is supported.
For example, ".IN +5" can be very powerful if you don't want
to worry about the current indent setting.
And always, a numeric expression may be used in place of a single
term.
".IN 30" may be what you code but ".IN &SYSLL/2" is what
you mean;
".SI 201" may be what you code but ".(100*2)+%" is
what you mean.
)sp
The undocumented control words are listed here with a brief
explanation of their function for complete documentation
of the current implementation.  It is suggested that the
preferred commands should be used wherever possible.
)sp
A complete documentation of all control words may be formatted
by specifying '+TYPE=ALL' in the invocation parameter list.
)ur This manual was formatted with TYPE='&TYPE'.

The ABEND control word is special purpose.

SUPRTRAC for debugging.
