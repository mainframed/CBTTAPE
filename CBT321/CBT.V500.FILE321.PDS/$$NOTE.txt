Enterprise Cobol V5 and the FIB. There is no documented way to
find the FIB in a static way like COBAnal does. I opened a PMR with
IBM and got the following reply
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As the developers were a little too busy to respond on this issue in a
timely fashion, I took a look at the LIST output for enlightenment.

You'll see there's an internal entry called __COMPUNITsinit (compile
unit static init) that populates the portion of the WSA (writeable
static areaÝ1¨) that belongs to the compile unit with values from the
constant area and/or constants created in the instruction stream,
including the FIBs and other Cobol control blocks.

The upshot is that the FIBs don't exist as such until the
__COMPUNITsinit has been run. Even if you can see what appears to
perhaps be an FIB image in the constant area, there's no guarantee all
the FIB fields will be there, or that the constant area layout will be
the same under different optimization schemes or compiler releases.

In other words, the approach you were using with the previous versions
of the compiler is untenable under COBOL v5, and looking at the source
code is the only real alternative.

Ý1¨ The WSA contains the working-storage and other data, including the
    FIBs, that have a lifetime of the run unit.
