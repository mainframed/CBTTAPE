//***FILE 546 is from the Stanford University FTP files, and        *   FILE 546
//*           contains the first of five books about the PL360      *   FILE 546
//*           language, in PDF format.  To read this file, you      *   FILE 546
//*           have to download (in binary) member PL360B01 to a     *   FILE 546
//*           PC, and use the Adobe Acrobat reader to read it.      *   FILE 546

//*           I think the books are too large, in PDF format,       *   FILE 546
//*           to be kept here.  In printable EBCDIC, they will      *   FILE 546
//*           not be too large.                                     *   FILE 546
//*                                                                 *   FILE 546
//*           This file is just a place holder, so if and when      *   FILE 546
//*           I am able to convert these manuals into printable     *   FILE 546
//*           EBCDIC format for the MVS machine, they will be       *   FILE 546
//*           placed here.  To find out the current location of     *   FILE 546
//*           these manuals in PDF format, available for download,  *   FILE 546
