 -OVERVIEW


    JDF is a system that runs under SPF to provide
    the user with the ability to display the status
    of all jobs on the JES2 spool, and to display
    the outputs of his own jobs at the terminal.
    The jobs may be awaiting execution, executing,
    awaiting print/transmission or held.

    The purpose of this system is  to  improve  the
    productivity of the terminal user while cutting
    system overhead and paper costs.

    User productivity is enhanced because JDF gives
    a realtime display of jobs executing or waiting
    to be executed/printed that will avoid the need
    to ask: "Where is my job?", or   "Why isn't  it
    running?". Using JDF you can see what is and is
    not happening in the system. JDF also gives you
    the ability to examine condition codes,  system
    messages, and actual report output while  a job
    is still running. This can save time, especially
    for long-running jobs.

    JDF will reduce  system overhead  because  JES2
    will not have to process the entire job in many
    cases.  If you can look at a  part of a job and
    just purge it,  for example a bad compile, then
    JES2 will have to do much less work than if the
    job has to be printed or transmitted across the
    TP lines in its entirety.


    The following pages provide a step-by-step guide
    to using JDF to perform the following:

     1. Checking Job status
     2. Browsing your Job output
     3. Printing your Job.
     4. Purging your Job.
     5. Selectively copying reports.


    Throughout the discussion below, the assumption is
    made that your normal batch jobs will be submitted
    with a job-name equal to your userid padded out to 8 bytes
    with alpha characters. The system is designed to work
    best if you follow this convention.

           NOTE: You can only access jobs whose jobnames begin
                 with your user-id, or that you have submitted.
                 This is a security restriction.

 -INVOKING JDF




    In order to use JDF, you must first LOGON to TSO. You will normally
    see the ISPF primary option menu, unless you are in FOCUS. From FOCUS,
    enter TSO ISPF on the command line.

    To invoke JDF, enter L.JDF in the "OPTION" field of the ISPF/PDF
    Primary Option Menu. The first display you will see is the JDF menu:


 --------      JES2 DISPLAY FACILITY  (JDF)     OPTION MENU---------------------

 SELECT OPTION ===>_

    A  DISPLAY ACTIVE - JOBS EXECUTING
    E  DISPLAY EVERY  - ALL JOBS IN THE SYSTEM (INCLUDING PURGE QUEUE)
    H  DISPLAY HELD   - JOBS WITH CLASS X SYSOUTS
    I  DISPLAY INIT   - STATUS OF INITIATORS
    L  DISPLAY LOG    - RUNNING SYSTEM LOG
    O  DISPLAY OUTPUT - JOBS AWAITING OUTPUT ON LOCAL PRINTERS
    R  DISPLAY REMOTE - JOBS AWAITING OUTPUT ON REMOTE QUEUE
    T  DISPLAY TRANSM - JOBS AWAITING NJE TRANSMISSION
    Q  DISPLAY QUEUE  - JOBS ON INPUT QUEUES
    S  STATUS         - ENTER JOB/LVL ===>_


 PRESS END KEY TO RETURN TO SPF PRIMARY OPTION MENU




    A general explanation of these options is provided by pressing PF 1.



    NOTE: JDF allows you to see the status of any job or started task.
          It does NOT allow you to look at the output of any job. You
          will be denied access to a job unless the jobname begins with
          your user-id, or you submitted it.

                                                                       PAGE  3

 -ACTIVE JOBS DISPLAY


    If, for example, you want to see a list of all jobs executing in the
    system, enter "A" and hit enter. You will see something like:



       --------------------- JES2 DISPLAY FACILITY (JDF) ---------------------
       COMMAND ==> RP                                           SCROLL => PAGE

       OPT JOBNUM   JOBNAME  STATUS          CL SYS

           JOB 1667 CICS1TST EXECUTING CLASS C  MVSA
           JOB  325 LDDZ0100 EXECUTING CLASS 4  MVSA
           JOB  341 MPSD1800 EXECUTING CLASS 3  MVSA
           JOB  360 ASQCCASM EXECUTING CLASS X  MVSB

       ******************************* BOTTOM OF DATA ************************


    There are 4 jobs executing in the system. The job class is also
    provided, and the system id (MVSA is the 3083, MVSB is the 3033).

    The PF1 key gives you "HELP" information describing what is on the
    screen, and PF 3 returns you to the JDF Option menu.


 -JDF COMMANDS


    JDF commands are entered on the COMMAND line at the top. Available
    commands are:

    RP   Repeat--this is the default command and just refreshes the display.

    ST   Status--this switches the display from the current mode to the
                 status display.

   JOB   Jobs  --this switches the Display Active to include batch jobs
                 only (this is the default).

   STC   Started tasks--this switches the Display Active to Started tasks.

   TSU   TSO Users--this switches the Display Active to show TSO users.

   D-    Switch display from the current queue. The "-" corresponds to
         the single letter option on the JDF Option Menu. For example,
         if you are in "Status" and want to display the output queues,
         enter "DO", and so on. This is quicker than going back to the
         JDF Option Menu.

                                                                    PAGE  4



 -JOB-LEVEL COMMANDS


    JDF Job-level commands are always entered in the "OPT" column next
    to the job you wish to operate on. Available commands are:

          S - Select a job for viewing.
          C - Cancel a job that is executing.
          P - Purge a job, deleting all outputs.
          H - Hold a job, so that JES2 will not process it further.
          A - Activate/release a job from hold.
        TC_ - Change a job's initiator class.
        RQA - Re-queue a job's outputs to print in SYSOUT class A.
        RQn - Re-queue a job's outputs to destination RMTn (class A).
        PUP - Increase print priority (Restricted command).


    NOTE: You can only use Job-level commands on jobs that you submitted,
          or whose job name begins with your user-id, except for the "S"
          option. You can use "S" to give you the DD name display for any
          job, TSO user, or started task.

 -DDNAME DISPLAY



    On the "Display Active" screen above, there are 4 jobs executing.
    To look at a job, ASQCCASM for example, while it is executing, TAB
    to the OPT column and enter "S" for select. This will give you the
    DD name display:


   ------------ JDF DDNAME DISPLAY ----------------------------------
   COMMAND ==>_                                        SCROLL => PAGE

        004           JOB MSGS      121  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        005           INT TEXT        0  A      ****  ****    1

        103  ASM      SYSPRINT     7331  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        104  LKED     SYSPRINT        0  X STD1 ****  ****    1



    The PF1 key gives you "HELP" information describing what is on the
    screen, and PF 3 returns you to the previous screen.

    The first line of the display gives you the JES job number and name
    for your reference. OPR gives you a condition code summary for the job.

    JES keeps track of job inputs and outputs by Data Set ID (DSID) numbers:

         DSID 001 is the input JCL exactly as you submitted it from your
                  TSO session.
         DSID 002 is the Jes Job Log; this corresponds to the first page
                  of your batch job's listing.
         DSID 003 is the execution JCL, including any PROCLIB JCL.
         DSID 004 is the Job Messages, this has all the allocation
                  messages, substitution JCL, etc.
         DSID 005 is the JES Internal Text. This is mainly useful for
                  the Software Engineering staff for problem determination.

    Notice that the display is in DSID order; the jobsteps and DD names
    are in the order of creation, which is how the DSID numbers are assigned.

    The remaining lines in the display describe the inputs and outputs.
    If all the DSID's will not fit on one screen, use PF 8 to scroll
    down and PF7 to scroll up.

 -DDNAME-LEVEL OPTIONS



    To select an individual report for viewing, TAB down the "OPT" column to
    the report you want to look at. Valid line selection characters are:

               S - Selects a report for viewing. This is the lowest-
                   overhead method to view a report. This is NOT the
                   ISPF/PDF browse, so commands are limited. PF 1 will
                   provide further details.

               B - Browse a report, copies the dataset to a TSO pack with
                   a name of "JOB.OUTLIST" and invokes the SPF BROWSE function.
                   You can use PF8 to scroll down and PF7 to scroll up,
                   and do character-string searches with the "Find" command.
                   This command will fail with an "E37" if the report needs
                   more than 16 cylinders. If that happens, go to the 3.2
                   screen, delete JOB.OUTLIST and re-allocate it with more
                   space.

               R - Reprint, discussed below on page 9.

                                                                  PAGE  7
 -OTHER JOB DISPLAY SCREENS

    The other displays are essentially the same as the "Display Active"
    example shown above in format, except for the "Display Initiators"
    screen, which is restricted.


 -STATUS DISPLAY SCREEN


    The "S" or Status display is probably the most useful one, since it
    allows you to limit the display to your jobs, whether they are on
    the input, output, or execution queue's. All you have to do is enter
    the leading characters of the job(s) you want to see.


 --------      JES2 DISPLAY FACILITY  (JDF)     OPTION MENU---------------------

 SELECT OPTION ===>S

    A  DISPLAY ACTIVE - JOBS EXECUTING
    E  DISPLAY EVERY  - ALL JOBS IN THE SYSTEM (INCLUDING PURGE QUEUE)
    H  DISPLAY HELD   - JOBS WITH CLASS X SYSOUTS
    I  DISPLAY INIT   - STATUS OF INITIATORS
    L  DISPLAY LOG    - RUNNING SYSTEM LOG
    O  DISPLAY OUTPUT - JOBS AWAITING OUTPUT ON LOCAL PRINTERS
    R  DISPLAY REMOTE - JOBS AWAITING OUTPUT ON REMOTE QUEUE
    T  DISPLAY TRANSM - JOBS AWAITING NJE TRANSMISSION
    Q  DISPLAY QUEUE  - JOBS ON INPUT QUEUES
    S  STATUS         - ENTER JOB/LVL ===>SMD

 PRESS END KEY TO RETURN TO SPF PRIMARY OPTION MENU


    On the line where it says "ENTER JOB/LVL" above, I have entered the
    3 letters "SMD". I have also entered an "S" as the option.

    When I hit ENTER, I will see something like this:


  ------------------- JES2 DISPLAY FACILITY (JDF) -----------------------------
  COMMAND ==> REPEAT                                             SCROLL => PAGE

  OPT JOBNUM   JOBNAME  STATUS

      JOB  922 SMDD0400 ON INPUT  CLASS 3                     HOLD
  ******************************* BOTTOM OF DATA ******************************


    This is the quick way to zero in on the jobs you want to look at.

                                                                  PAGE  8

 -SYSLOG DISPLAY SCREEN


    The "L" or Syslog display shows you any active system console logs.
    They are shown on the screen just as though they were normal started
    tasks. The system-id field indicates whether the Syslog is for the
    MVSA or MVSB systems. TAB down to the one you want to view and enter
    "S" in the "OPT" column.

    The DD name display you will see is not the same as for batch jobs,
    as shown above, since Syslog is not really a job. Instead, you will
    see a set of "spin" datasets, one of which will be high-lighted.

    The high-lighted entry is the currently-active Syslog dataset. To
    view it, TAB down the "OPT" column and enter an "S" or "B" next to
    it. Do NOT attempt to view any other entries. The results are not
    predictable. Your user session may abend, or you may just see junk.

                                                                       PAGE  9



 -REPRINT PROCESSING



    Reprint is an option that is entered on the DDNAME display to copy
    an individual report. The advantage of this is that you can route
    a copy to a remote user, print one copy of a multi-copy report, etc.

    In order to use this, you have to get the JDF DDNAME display. From
    any Job-level display screen, such as "A", Display Active, or "S"
    for Status, TAB down to the job you want, type "S" and ENTER. You
    will then see the DDNAME display.

    For example:



   ------------ JDF DDNAME DISPLAY ----------------------------------
   COMMAND ==>_                                        SCROLL => PAGE

             JOB00360 ASQCCASM
   OPT  DSID STEPNAME DDNAME      LINES  CLFORM FCB   UCS   COP
        OPR           BPSCAN
        001           INPUT JCL       9  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        002           JOB LOG        12  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        003           JCL            17  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        004           JOB MSGS      121  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        005           INT TEXT        0  A      ****  ****    1
        101  ASM      SYSIN        2439  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        102  LKED     SYSIN           9  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        103  ASM      SYSPRINT     7331  X STD1 ****  ****    1
        104  LKED     SYSPRINT        0  X STD1 ****  ****    1





    TAB down to the left of the report you want to make a copy of, type
    "R" in the "OPT" column, and hit ENTER. JDF will then re-display the
    screen. You can then REPRINT additional reports if you wish by going
    through the same steps for each one. When you have finished selecting
    reports, hit PF3; JDF will display a job-stream that will do the
    actual reprinting. You can make any changes you want in the JCL,
    just by typing over the existing information. When you are satisfied
    that the job will do what you want, you MUST type "SUB" in the command
    line at the top; JDF will NOT submit the job for you. After submitting
    the job, hit PF3 to return to the Job-level display.

                                                                       PAGE 10





    One common change you can make in the JCL of this job is in the
    "/*ROUTE" card; if you want to route the report to a remote user, you
    just change it to: /*ROUTE PRINT remote-id. (See JCL manual for
    details on coding the ROUTE card.)

    The REPRINT option has the additional ability to specify the
    SYSOUT class you want the report printed in or the remote
    destination to which the report is to be sent:

      RA   sends the output to print class "A" to print on the 3800;
           you could use this to print a single copy of a multi-copy
           report, for example. (This is the default.)

      RS   sends the output to the 3203-5 Special Forms printer.

      RW   sends the output to PANSPOOL. This might be useful if you
           wanted to "archive" an individual report for backup.

      Rn   sends the output to remote number "n".

 -RESTRICTIONS



    There are a number of restrictions in the use of JDF. Among these
    are:

      1. You cannot view all the reports produced by a job unless the
         Job-name begins with your userid. During the CMS-to-TSO
         conversion period, you will also be able to view jobs that
         you have submitted from your CMS userid, regardless of Jobname.

         You should begin using your userid as the leading characters
         of your jobs.

      2. You can see the status of any production or test jobs, started
         tasks, or TSO sessions. You can also look at condition codes,
         allocation messages, converted JCL, etc. Those items may be
         useful for application problem determination.

         You can NOT see the inputs and outputs of production jobs.

      3. Job-level commands are restricted in the same way as point 1,
         above. You can only cancel or purge your own jobs. In addition,
         the command that increases a job's print priority is restricted
         to Operations.

                                                                       PAGE 12



 -USAGE GUIDLINES





   1. Probably the most effective way to use JDF is to submit your jobs so
      that the output is held in class X. For jobs submitted from TSO, do
      the following:

               1.  Code your JOB card: //XXXXXASM  JOB  (acct),'name',
                                       //  MSGCLASS=X
                   Where "XXXXX" is your user-id. MSGCLASS=X puts your
                   job's output in held, or "NRDY" status.

               2.  Make all your SYSOUT's "SYSOUT=X", or "SYSOUT=*".


   2. Make the leading characters of your test jobs match your user-id.

   3. Before you re-submit a job, purge the previous one, or change the
      jobname. This will help you to keep track of which job you want
      to work with.

   4. When you are in one type of Job display, you can switch to any
      other job-level display by typing over the "RP" in the command
      area. For example, if you are in "ST" (STATUS) mode, you can
      display the output queue by typing "DO" on the command line. You
      do not have to return to the JDF Option menu to switch from one
      category of display to another.
