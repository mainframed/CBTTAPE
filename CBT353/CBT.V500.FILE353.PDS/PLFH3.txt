%-----------------------PAN Library Facility   (PLF)  -------------------------+
+
+
 + This the initial menu for PLF.

   The PAN library name must be specified as a fully-qualified dsname,
  %NOT+ in quotes. This is contrary to normal TSO practice, but since
   none of our PAN libraries begin with someone's userid, it just seems
   too silly to require everything to be put in quotes.

   If the library is control word protected, such as P.SOURCE or PROD.JCL,
   the control word must be provided, also.

   If you wish to use the transfer commands, enter the target library and
   the control word if applicable.
