%-----------------     VTOC Display Facility (VDF) -----------------------------
%
+  This VTOC display provides the information from the LOCATE SVC, which
+ is formatted in a one-line-per-volume display.
+
+  The scope of the display can be limited by entering "V=AAA" on the
+ command line, where "AAA" is the first 3 letters of the volser. Also,
+ the display can be limited to system packs by entering "V=SYS"; this
+ is an exception to the rule, above.
+
+  Entering%S+in the "SEL" column next to a pack invokes the ISPF Dataset
+ List (Option 3.4), but I haven't figured out a way to prime the VOLSER.
