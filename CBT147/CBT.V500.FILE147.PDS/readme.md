 To install the ARCHIVER program, in all its glory (?), edit and
 execute the job in member $INSTALL, in the source dataset.  Then
 print the $ARCHDOC member of the source dataset to learn how to use
 it, or download member ARCHIVE$ for a PDF document or download
 member ARCHIVE@ for the Microsoft Word version of the manual.
 Some functions are demonstrated by samples in the SAMPLIB
 dataset as well.

 *-------------------------- IMPORTANT -------------------------------*
 Read member @FILE147 if you want only to install the load modules
 instead of assemble and link the sources.
 *-------------------------- IMPORTANT -------------------------------*

 And remember: this is a freebie to anyone who wants it.  I would be
 interested in hearing (or reading) your comments and experiences and
 will be somewhat receptive to suggestions for improvement.  One user
 who has used the 'BETA' code extensively wants a COMPARE function.
 Interesting.  (in the works)
