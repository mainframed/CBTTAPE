 THINGS THAT USERS WOULD STILL LIKE TO SEE IN THE ARCHIVER:

 *  ERROR MESSAGES ARE NOT REAL OBVIOUS. THEN SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT
    OF LEAD-IN FLAGS THAT WOULD MAKE THEM STAND OUT.

 *  THE LIST/LISTT FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIST THE PDS DIRECTORY
    DATA, INCLUDING ANY ALIAS INFORMATION PRESENT.

    (WHEN I DO THAT, THINK ABOUT ADDING LINK EDIT DATE FOR LMODS.
     COULD BE EXTRACTED DURING UNLOAD OR RECONSTRUCTED DURING
     THE LIST, IF I CAN IDENTIFY THE LINKAGE EDITOR IDR RECORDS.)

 *   MAKE THE COMPARE FUNCTION OPTIONALLY CALL THE DELETE & ADDALIAS
     FUNCTIONS AUTOMATICALLY WHEN A DUPLICATE IS FOUND.

 *   OPTIONALLY GENERATE ISPF-LIKE DIRECTORY STATISTICS FOR NON-LMOD
     PDS MEMBER RELOADS, IF THAT DATA ISN'T ALREADY PRESENT.

 *   RANGE VALUES FOR QUALIFIER DATA ON CONTROL STATEMENTS.

 *   ABEND INTERCEPTION IN ARCHPARS ??

 *   ABILITY TO DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE OUTPUT NON-VSAM DATASETS BASED ON THE
     ITEMS TO BE LOADED INTO IT. (FOR CBT TAPE PROCESSING!)
