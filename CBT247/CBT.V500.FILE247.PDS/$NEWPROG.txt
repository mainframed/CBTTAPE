Some of the new programs for the BRODCAST MANAGER.

    BCMDUMP - Takes an existing SYS1.BRODCAST dataset and dumps it
              into a FB-130 fixed blocked file, for transport to
              another system, or for backup purposes.

    BCMREST - Restores a SYS1.BRODCAST format file (it could be a
              copy), from the dump file created by BCMDUMP.  Many
              of the programs in this package can be run against
              this copy of SYS1.BRODCAST.  The listing programs all
              work (BCMLIST, BCMLISY, BCMLISX, BCMLIS).  Also,
              BCMDEL2 will work, because it operates against the
              actual structure of the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset, which
              is duplicated by BCMREST.  BCMREST will also allow
              the restore of SYS1.BRODCAST on a different device
              type, because the deleted message records (type X'FF')
              have to have the next byte as the "R" in the record's
              CCHHR, and this quantity is appropriately adjusted
              upon restore of the rest of the record.

    BCMEXPND- Restores a SYS1.BRODCAST format file (same as BCMREST)
              except that it expands the file with extra unused user
              message records, to fill the first allocated extent.

    BCMSEND - Sends a user message to SYS1.BRODCAST or a copy of it.
              SYNTAX is:   BCMSEND userid message-text
