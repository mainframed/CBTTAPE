   We've made an attempt to ISPF-ize this package, so a system
   administrator can control the display, reporting, and
   deletion of messages in SYS1.BRODCAST, for any user.

   Please see member BCMISPF, which is Vinh Vu's better attempt
   to ISPF-ize this package.

   This note assumes that you've assembled all the programs, and
   placed the load modules in a load library that is accessible
   to your TSO session.  The TSO commands BCMDEL and BCMDEL1 have
   to be authorized, but BCMDEL2 does not have to be authorized.
   This is because BCMDEL and BCMDEL1 call the authorized TSO
   command LISTBC.  See member LOADMODS for recently assembled
   load modules in TSO XMIT format.

   To put the ISPF stuff into action, use the PANELS and CLISTS
   members.  Run job $LOADSPF to create temporary panel and
   clist libraries, to copy into your system ones.

   Run the BCMUI CLIST to get started.

   The BCMTRAP exec was supplied by John Kalinich, and it takes
   a modified message member ISRZ00.  If you don't want to use
   John's modification, just change name ISRZ000W in BCMTRAP to
   ISRZ000.  The difference is in the message which reports the
   program BCMTRAP is running.  Native ISPF will put the message
   in the upper right corner.  John's version will make a
   temporary window that's nicer to look at.

   The panels and CLISTs in this collection are for the purpose
   of ISPF'izing the SYS1.BRODCAST management package to make it
   easier to use.  A sysprog, or other designated person, can now
   easily manage the user messages in any system's SYS1.BRODCAST
   dataset, and you won't have to worry so much, anymore, about
   the broadcast dataset becoming full.  You can now administer
   it on each system, easily.

   Just copy the panels into your panel library, and CLISTs into
   a library in the SYSPROC concatenation, execute the BCMUI
   clist, and you're off to the races.

   Do not put the PANELS member through ascii translation and back.
   There are unprintable characters there.  Use TSO XMIT with the
   OUTDSN keyword to create a transmittable file from a pds.
