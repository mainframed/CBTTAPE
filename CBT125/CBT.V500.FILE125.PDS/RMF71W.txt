| **THIS PROGRAM IS THE SAME AS RMF71 EXCEPT IT STORES DATA   **    |
| **BY WEEK RATHER THAN BY MONTH. IT DOES THIS BY SAVEING     **    |
| **THE DATA WITH A DIFFERENT NAME (CONTAINS THE CHARACTERS   **    |
| **"WK" IN THE SAS NAME). COMPARE THE DATA STATEMENTS TO SEE **    |
| **THE DIFFERENCE.                                           **    |

|   SMF DATA FOR PAGING ACTIVITY                                    |
|   ONLY LOOKING AT SMF TYPE 71 RECORDS. FOR MVS/XA SYSTEMS         |
|                                                                   |
|   DATA MUST BE SORTED BEFORE BEING USED BY                        |
|         SMF71SID,SMF71DAT,SMF71IST                                |
|         (JUST USE THE SORT MEMBER)                                |
|                                                                   |
| ----                       -----                            ----  |
|   SINCE THE DATA IS SAVED BY SYSTEM ID (SMF ID) THEN THE ONLY     |
|   THING THAT MAKES THESE PROGRAMS INSTALLATION DEPENDANT ARE      |
|   1) THE LITERALS FOR CHECKING THE SYSTEM ID                      |
|       -LOCATED AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM                          |
|   2) THE MEMBER NAME THAT IS GIVEN TO THE SAS DATASET (ONE FOR    |
|      EACH SYSTEM)                                                 |
|       -LOCATED IN THE BEGINING (DATA STATEMENT)                   |
|        AND AT THE END, FOLLOWING THE "OUTPUT" STATEMENTS          |
|                                                                   |
|   IN ADDITION, SINCE THE DATA IS NORMALLY STORED BY MONTH         |
|   THEN THE MEMBER NAMES REFERENCED IN NUMBER 2 ABOVE              |
|   IS CHANGED SLIGHTLY EACH MONTH TO REFLECT THE MONTH AND YEAR.   |

|   THIS JOB RECREATES THE RMF 71 RECORD WITH INFORMATION           |
|   ABOUT PAGES PER SECOND. IT THROWS OUT INTERVALS OF 1 MIN OR     |
|   LESS. IT SAVES IT IN A SAS FILE BY SYSTEM ID AND ALSO GIVES     |
|   GIVES A PRINTOUT OF THIS INFORMATION.                           |
|   THIS SAS FILE THEN CAN BE USED AS INPUT TO CREATE A GRAPH       |
|   EITHER ON THE TERMINAL OR TO A PRINTER USING GDDM.              |
