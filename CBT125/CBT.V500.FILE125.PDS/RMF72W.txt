| **THIS PROGRAM IS THE SAME AS RMF72 EXCEPT IT STORES DATA   **    |
| **BY WEEK RATHER THAN BY MONTH. IT DOES THIS BY SAVEING     **    |
| **THE DATA WITH A DIFFERENT NAME (CONTAINS THE CHARACTERS   **    |
| **"WK" IN THE SAS NAME). COMPARE THE DATA STATEMENTS TO SEE **    |
| **THE DIFFERENCE.                                           **    |

|   SMF DATA FOR TSO RESPONSE TIME                                  |
|   ONLY LOOKING AT SMF TYPE 72 RECORDS. FOR MVS/XA SYSTEMS         |
|                                                                   |
|   DATA MUST BE SORTED BEFORE BEING USED BY                        |
|         SMF72SID,SMF72DAT,SMF72IST                                |
|         (JUST USE THE SORT MEMBER)                                |

|   SINCE THE DATA IS SAVED BY SYSTEM ID (SMF ID) THEN THE ONLY     |
|   THING THAT MAKES THESE PROGRAMS INSTALLATION DEPENDANT ARE      |
|   1) THE LITERALS FOR CHECKING THE SYSTEM ID                      |
|       -LOCATED AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM                          |
|   2) THE MEMBER NAME THAT IS GIVEN TO THE SAS DATASET (ONE FOR    |
|      EACH SYSTEM)                                                 |
|       -LOCATED IN THE BEGINING (DATA STATEMENT)                   |
|        AND AT THE END, FOLLOWING THE "OUTPUT" STATEMENTS          |
|                                                                   |
|   IN ADDITION, SINCE THE DATA IS NORMALLY STORED BY MONTH         |
|   THEN THE MEMBER NAMES REFERENCED IN NUMBER 2 ABOVE              |
|   IS CHANGED SLIGHTLY EACH MONTH TO REFLECT THE MONTH AND YEAR.   |

|    THIS JOB PICKS UP TRANSACTIONS IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE          |
|   GROUPS (PG) (CURRENTLY PG NUMBERS 2 AND 3)                      |
|   AND CALCULATES RESPONSE TIME BY PG AND BY                       |
|   EACH PERIOD WITHIN THAT PERFORMANCE GROUP.                      |

|   NOTE: THIS PROGRAM ASSUMES THAT EACH TSO PERFORMANCE            |
|         GROUP HAS FOUR PERIODS. YOU MAY ONLY NEED TRIVIAL         |
