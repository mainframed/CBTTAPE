|   THIS PROGRAM READS INPUT FROM 2 SYSTEMS. (THE INPUT IS CREATED  |
|   BY "CPUT") IF MACHINES ARE = AND THIS IS NOT PR/SM THEN ADD     |
|   THE 2 UTILIZATIONS TOGETHER AND DIVIDE BY THE APPROPRIATE       |
|   NUMBER.                                                         |
|   IF THIS IS PR/SM AND THE PARTITIONS ARE DEDICATED THEN DO THE   |
|   SAME THING. HOWEVER, IF THE LPARS HAVE SHARED CPU'S THEN        |
|   USE THE INFORMATION FROM ONE SYSTEM ONLY SINCE ALL THE INFO     |
|   IS THERE.                                                       |
