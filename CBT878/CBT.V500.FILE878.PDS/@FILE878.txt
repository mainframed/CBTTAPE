//***FILE 878 is from Joe Reichman and contains an APF-authorized   *   FILE 878
//*           TSO command to forcibly terminate an address space.   *   FILE 878
//*           This command is newly written, and was inspired by    *   FILE 878
//*           the old TSO BURN command, but it is completely new.   *   FILE 878
//*           It has been tested to z/OS 1.13.  It was also tested  *   FILE 878
//*           to work as far back as ESA 5.2.2.                     *   FILE 878
//*                                                                 *   FILE 878
//*           This command is useful when an address space          *   FILE 878
//*           (system or user) is causing trouble in the system,    *   FILE 878
//*           and it needs to be restarted.  And you can use this   *   FILE 878
//*           command to get rid of that address space when you     *   FILE 878
//*           can't easily do it by conventional means, which are   *   FILE 878
//*           the CANCEL or FORCE operator console commands.        *   FILE 878
//*                                                                 *   FILE 878
//*           This is a handy emergency tool to keep in your        *   FILE 878
//*           tool kit.  A HELP member is included in this file.    *   FILE 878
//*                                                                 *   FILE 878
