This is just to note that I am including the older version of TAPEMAP
in this file, because TAPEMAP is hard to test.  There may be a case
when the old one works and the new one doesn't.  If there are any
problems......       email:  sbgolob@attglobal.net

I made sure to blank out the DATE DAY TIME fields in the TODAY CSECT,
because x'00' characters were appearing in the TAPEMAP report headings.
