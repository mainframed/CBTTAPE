XBE - EXECUTE BROWSE OR EDIT                              APRIL 25 1991

WRITTEN BY BILL GODFREY, PRC INC.

XBE IS A PROGRAM THAT IS EXECUTED FROM ISPF SELECTION PANELS

XBE ALLOWS YOU TO SET UP ISPF SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE SHORT CODE WORDS
FOR DATA SETS THAT YOU FREQUENTLY EDIT OR BROWSE.

FOR EXAMPLE, WITH A SINGLE-LINE CHANGE TO THE PRIMARY OPTION PANEL,
ISR@PRIM, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE EDIT MEMBER SELECTION
LIST FOR SYS1.PROCLIB JUST BY ENTERING "PR" FROM THE PRIMARY OPTION
PANEL, OR BY ENTERING "=PR" FROM ANYWHERE IN ISPF.  YOU WILL ALSO
BE ABLE TO GO STRAIGHT INTO EDIT FOR A SPECIFIC MEMBER OF SYS1.PROCLIB
JUST BY ENTERING "PR.MEMBERNAME" FROM THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU, OR BY
ENTERING "=PR.MEMBERNAME" FROM ANYWHERE IN ISPF.

THE LINE TO BE ADDED TO ISR@PRIM WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

          PR,'PGM(XBE) PARM(E,SYS1.PROCLIB) NOCHECK'

IF YOU ADD ANOTHER LINE LIKE THIS:

        EDIT,'PGM(XBE) PARM(E,ISR.V2R3M0.ISRPLIB(ISR@PRIM)) NOCHECK'

YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GO DIRECTLY INTO EDIT ON YOUR PRIMARY OPTION PANEL
ITSELF JUST BY ENTERING "EDIT" FROM THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU, OR "=EDIT"
FROM ANYWHERE.  WE HAVE MANY OF OUR SELECTION PANELS SET UP TO GO INTO
EDIT ON THEMSELVES JUST BY SPECIFYING 'EDIT' ON THAT PANEL.

IF YOU ADD ANOTHER LINE LIKE THIS:

                E,'PGM(XBE) PROC(E,&ZUSER..LIB.CNTL) NOCHECK'

THEN EACH USER ON THE SYSTEM CAN GET INTO A SPECIFIC MEMBER OF HIS OR
HER LIB.CNTL LIBRARY FROM ANYWHERE IN ISPF JUST BY ENTERING
"=E.MEMBERNAME".

TO KEEP UPDATE ACTIVITY ON ISR@PRIM TO A MINIMUM, WE SET UP A NEW PANEL
NAMED 'DSNP01' WHICH IS REACHED FROM THE PRIMARY MENU BY ENTERING 'D'.
THE PRIMARY OPTION PANEL HAS THIS LINE ADDED:

                D,'PANEL(DSNP01)'

THE 'DSNP02' PANEL LOOKS LIKE THIS (IN ABBREVIATED FORM):


%--------------------------  SYSTEM DATA SET MENU  -------------------
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD                                                             +
%
%      PA +SYS1.PARMLIB          % PA2 +SYS2.PARMLIB
%      PR +SYS1.PROCLIB          % PR2 +SYS2.PROCLIB
%
%       X +EXIT          - RETURN TO PRIMARY OPTION MENU
%
+ENTER%END+COMMAND TO RETURN TO PRIMARY OPTION MENU
%
)INIT
  .HELP = ISR00003
)PROC
  &ZSEL = TRANS( TRUNC (&ZCMD,'.')
               PA,'PGM(XBE) PARM(E,SYS1.PARMLIB) NOCHECK'
               PR,'PGM(XBE) PARM(E,SYS1.PROCLIB) NOCHECK'
              PA2,'PGM(XBE) PARM(E,SYS2.PARMLIB) NOCHECK'
              PR2,'PGM(XBE) PARM(E,SYS2.PROCLIB) NOCHECK'
              JCL,'PGM(XBE) PARM(E,SYS2.JCLLIB) NOCHECK'
             EDIT,'PGM(XBE) PARM(E,SYS2.PANELS(DSNP01)) NOCHECK'
           BROWSE,'PGM(XBE) PARM(B,SYS2.PANELS(DSNP01)) NOCHECK'
              ' ',' '
                X,'EXIT'
                *,'?' )
  &ZTRAIL = .TRAIL
)END


NOTICE THAT YOUR MENU DOESN'T HAVE TO DISPLAY ALL OF THE AVAILABLE
OPTIONS.  IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, "JCL" WILL STILL TAKE YOU INTO
SYS2.JCLLIB EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT SHOWN ON THE MENU. "EDIT" WILL
PUT YOU INTO EDIT ON THE PANEL ITSELF.

UNDER THIS KIND OF SETUP, YOU CAN GET INTO SYS1.PARMLIB BY ENTERING
"D.PA" FROM THE PRIMARY MENU, OR BY ENTERING "=D.PA" FROM ANYWHERE.
YOU CAN GET INTO A SPECIFIC MEMBER OF SYS1.PARMLIB BY ENTERING
"=D.PA.MEMBERNAME".

OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE "SYSTEMS DATA SET" MENU DEFINED ABOVE
BY ENTERING "D" FROM THE PRIMARY MENU, AND THEN ENTER "PA" FROM THE
NEW MENU TO GET INTO SYS1.PARMLIB.

XBE REQUIRES TWO PARAMETERS, AND ACCEPTS THREE ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL
PARAMETERS.  PARAMETERS ARE SEPARATED BY COMMAS. OMITTED PARAMETERS
ARE SPECIFIED BY CONSECUTIVE COMMAS.
 .  THE 1ST PARAMETER IS THE BROWSE-OR-EDIT OPTION "B" OR "E".
 .  THE 2ND PARAMETER IS THE DATA SET NAME, WHICH CAN BE A PDS,
    PDS(MEMBERNAME), OR SEQUENTIAL DATA SET.
 .  THE 3RD PARAMETER IS AN OPTIONAL VOLUME, FOR UNCATALOGED DATA SETS
    (OR FOR BYPASSING THE CATALOG OVERHEAD FOR CATALOGED DATA SETS).
 .  THE 4TH PARAMETER IS AN OPTIONAL PROFILE NAME FOR EDIT.
 .  THE 5TH PARAMETER IS AN OPTIONAL INITIAL MACRO FOR EDIT.

AFTER INSTALLING XBE, AND AFTER INSTALLING ANY UPGRADE OR MAINTENANCE
TO ISPF/PDF, IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO TEST THE EDIT RECOVERY FEATURE TO
MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS OK.
1.  EDIT SOMETHING.
2.  IN EDIT, SET RECOVERY ON IF IT ISN'T ALREADY.
3.  MAKE SOME CHANGES, BUT DON'T SAVE.
4.  STILL IN EDIT, ASK THE OPERATOR TO CANCEL YOUR SESSION
    (OR GO TO LUNCH AND LET YOUR SESSION TIME OUT).
5.  LOGON AGAIN, AND GO INTO ISPF/PDF.
6.  EDIT SOMETHING USING AN OPTION THAT GOES THRU XBE.
    IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME THING YOU WERE EDITING BEFORE.
7.  IF YOU GET AN EDIT RECOVERY MENU ASKING WHAT YOU WANT
    TO DO ABOUT THE STUFF YOU WERE EDITING BEFORE, IT'S WORKING,
    AND YOU CAN SKIP THE REMAINING STEPS.
8.  REPEAT STEPS 1 THRU 5. THEN, INSTEAD OF STEP 6, GO TO STEP 9.
9.  EDIT SOMETHING BY SELECTING OPTION "2".
    IF YOU GET AN EDIT RECOVERY MENU, THEN IBM'S EDIT RECOVERY IS OK,
    AND SOMETHING IN XBE HAS TO BE CHANGED TO FIX THE PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH
    EVERYTHING ELSE IN XBE SHOULD STILL WORK.
    IF YOU DON'T GET AN EDIT RECOVERY MENU, THEN THE PROBLEM WITH
    EDIT RECOVERY IS NOT RELATED TO XBE.  CORRECT IT AND REPEAT THE
    WHOLE PROCESS.


NOTE: WHENEVER YOU MAKE A CHANGE TO A PANEL THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN USED
SINCE YOU ENTERED ISPF, THE CHANGE WILL NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE NEXT
TIME YOU ENTER ISPF AFTER HAVING EXITED FROM IT.


   * * *   W A R N I N G   * * *
IT IS DANGEROUS TO CHANGE THE PRIMARY OPTION PANEL (ISR@PRIM) BECAUSE
IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE THAT LEAVES THE PANEL UNUSABLE, NOBODY ON THE
SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO GET INTO ISPF, INCLUDING YOURSELF, SO IT CAN
BE VERY DIFFICULT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  SO BE SURE YOU HAVE A WAY
OF RECOVERING ISR@PRIM QUICKLY, AND DON'T DEPEND ON USING ISPF TO DO
THE RECOVERY.  IF YOU ARE GOING TO ADD A SELF-EDIT OPTION TO THE
PRIMARY OPTION PANEL, YOU BETTER HAVE SOME SECURITY ON THE PANEL
LIBRARY THAT RESTRICTS WRITE-ACCESS.
