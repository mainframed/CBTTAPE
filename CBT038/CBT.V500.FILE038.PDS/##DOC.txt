    PROGRAM KLINGON          A SPACE WAR GAME

    BY LARRY WILLIAMS

    WITH CONSULTING AND ASSISTANCE: MARK STEVENS

    PROGRAMMER'S NOTES
    ------------------

    KLINGON IS A SPACE WAR GAME WRITTEN FOR CONTROL
    DATA CORPORATION MACHINES 6000 OR HIGHER WITH
    FORTRAN 5 (ANSI 1977 STANDARD)

    VERSION 1.2 WAS UPDATED IN 1987 - MARCH TO OPERATE UNDER
    MVS/TSO ON 3270 24 OR 43 LINE TERMINALS IN FULLSCREEN MODE
    AND VIA FORTRAN I/O (UNITS 5/6) FOR NON 3270

    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
    ------------ ------------

    (1) - Insure that a IBM FORTRAN compiler is available.
          If you do not have a version of FORTRAN available, a job
          has been provided (#GETFORT) in this pds to unload the
          compiler and callib from your CBT tape.

          ( ) - FORTRAN is already installed (or)
          ( ) - RUN JOB #GETFORT
                WRITE NAME OF FORTRAN COMPILER/CALLIB BELOW:

                ____________________________________________
                 (chosen in job #GETFORT)

          If FORTRAN is already installed in your system linklist,
          use "SYS1.LINKLIB" for all the STEPLIB references.

          NOTE:  The only FORTRAN compilers this game has been tested
          with are the FORTRAN compilers from the CBT tape.  There is
          no reason I can think of why VS-FORTRAN could not be used,
          but if something abends, etc. try running with the CBT FORTRAN

    (2) - Allocate a PDS (your choice of name) that is
          able to hold 300 blocks of data  i.e. SPACE=(3120,(300,100,35)
          LRECL=80, BLKSIZE=3120, with 35 directory blocks for use
          as a work OBJECT library.

          ( ) - WRITE DS NAME HERE ___________________________________


    (3) - Review the member SHIFTAB, and decide when KLINGON should be
          allowed to be played, the default is to allow play anytime.
          update this member if exclusions are to be made.


    (4) - Review the startup module "GAINIT" (in this pds)
          and review the following:

          ( ) Set label IBMTSO to 1 (default) if game is to be played
              On IBM/TSO with 3270 support, or set to 0 (zero) if
              sequential mode (line by line) is to be used
              Hercules users should
              use 1 (yes)

              check one:  ( ) - 3270 yes       ( ) - 3270 no

          ( ) Set label GRAPHICS to 1 (default) for 3270 graphics,
              or 0 if not desired.  During a game a user can turn
              graphics on and off only if this flag is set to 1.
              1 (yes) is the suggested value. Hercules users should
              use 1 (yes)

              check one:  ( ) - Graphics yes   ( ) - Graphics no


    (5) - Decide what load library you would like the modules
          "KL" (main routine) and "KLINIT (file init routine) to be
          installed into.

          The supplied Hercules game CLIST uses the following:

           LOADLIB(HERC01.KL.LOAD) -
           HELPFILE(HERC01.KL.PDS(#KLHELP))
           GRAPHIC(HERC01.KL.PDS(#GRAFICS))

          ( ) - WRITE DS NAME HERE ___________________________________


    (6) - Edit Member #JCLFULL and modify the dataset names as needed
          dataset names that need to be modified are marked with
          "<--", also the strings "USR" and "USERID" have
          been used for information that needs to be changed. Please
          note:  The JCL marked with a '$$' in column 1 is the prototype
          JCL to actually assemble/compile/link KLINGON
          do not change any parms except the work unit name (VIO is
          default)  You should change the jobcard in the $$ jcl to
          meet your standards, the card may be continued if needed.

          If FORTRAN H is not the desired FORTRAN, modify the compiler
          program name as needed.

          If FORTRAN is installed in your system linklist, change the
          references to all "FORTRAN" libraries to "SYS1.LINKLIB"
          This will in effect, "dummy out" the steplib reference.

          If you wish to review the JCL before submitting it, modify
          the FT14F001 dd card to NOT use the internal reader.

    (7) - Run the #JCLFULL JOB

          This job will feed jobs to the internal reader to assemble
          and link KLINGON, because they all use the same job name,
          the jobs will wait for the one ahead of it to finish.
          This is good, you can't link something not asssembled yet!

          If needed, KLINGON can be assembled with FOFTRAN G, but will
          run much slower.

    (8) - Copy the graphics file to a sequential dataset (Hercules
          users can skip this step)

          Allocate a LRECL 80 dataset to hold the graphics data, if
          graphics have been selected (see step 4)
          and copy member #GRAFICS to that file.

          If graphics are not selected, then write "NULLFILE"
          below:


          WRITE DSNAME HERE __________________________________________

          (NOTE: A pds should not be used since the dsn-enq will tie up
          the whole file, also, IBM access methods used by old FORTRAN
          can be confused opening two members at the same time)
          On a one user Hercules system, this is not important.


    (9) - Copy the help file to a sequential dataset (Hercules users
          can skip this step)

          Allocate a LRECL 80 dataset to hold the help data.
          and copy member #KLHELP to that file.

          WRITE DSNAME HERE __________________________________________

          ( ) - Be sure to modify the comments in the help file to
          say where the rules "manual" is stored (member #RULES)

          (NOTE: A pds should not be used since the dsn-enq will tie up
          the whole file, also, IBM access methods used by old FORTRAN
          can be confused opening two members at the same time)
          On a one user Hercules system, this is not important.


    (10)- MODIFY THE CLIST FOR THE GAME

          If you have chosen sequential mode (see step 4)
          modify clist #KLSEQ to meet your requirements (see steps 5-9)

          If you have chosen 3270 mode (see step 4)
          modify clist #KL3270 to meet your requirements (see steps 5-9)

          A premodified clist for Hercules users is in #KLHERC

          The default UNIT type for the "high-speed work files" is VIO,
          If desired, this may be changed to SYSDA instead.

          ( ) - Move the modified CLIST to the library of your choice

    (11)- Try the game! should work great.

    (12)- At this point, the object file may be deleted (if desired)

          DEBUGGING INFORMATION
          --------- -----------

          KLINGON is an rather advanced game program, and sometimes
          data for debugging needs to be collected.

          To collect bebugging data the FT10F001 file must be
          pre-allocated.

          To activate debugging trace:

          At the "COMMAND ?" prompt in KLINGON
          enter "XDEBUG" The password to activate/deactivate XDEBUG
          is "NONA"
