This file (221) goes together with File 220 from Lee Conyers.

This file (221) contains REXX execs to perform many EDP auditing
"snooping" functions.  This material will be useful for systems
programmers as well.  The material was tested on an MVS/XA 2.2.3
system.  Some of it also runs on MVS/ESA 4.3, but not all of it.

If you can fix any of this material for higher versions of the MVS
operating system, please submit your material to Sam Golob, at his
address as listed on File 001 of this tape.
