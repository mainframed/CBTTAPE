Got it.  Thanks.  I suggest you pass your updated version to Sam
Golob also, and be sure to take credit for the changes.  :-)

  Looking into it.  I wrote it primarily because of ASM-H using
  machine carriage controls.

    Rick,

    I down loaded the machine to ANSI control character utility.  I
    am processing our print files and have run into a problem.  As
    it turns out, we have some old programs that are generating
    immediate machine carriage control codes.  Since this utility
    discards immediate code lines, the converted to ANSI print
    lines are printing without the same number of skips between the
    print lines.  Example:


            Machine converted to            ANSI
              '8B'                                   'F1'
              '09'                                   'F0'
              '13'
              '09'

    Could you help me out with this problem?  I am not sure why
    the immediate lines are discarded.  In the above example,
    they are actually trying to overprint the lines.

    Regards,

                                    Joe Garcia Jr.
