+
+ PDS Command Processor FAQ
+ -------------------------
+
+ This document is for the new PDS user who may be struggling to use
+ the vast number of PDS subcommands and their operands.
+
+ 1.  "I took a quick look at PDS via TSO.  Some of the things displayed
+     when 'help' is entered don't work."   Why?
+
+     Some of the PDS subcommands such as BLKDISK, COMPARE, DSAT, DVOL,
+     HEL, RELEASE, REVIEW and VTOC are TSO command processors and they
+     must be installed and available via a TASKLIB in order to work.
+     They can be installed by issuing a TSO RECEIVE on the UTILXMIT
+     member of the installation library.  You can use the TSOLIB command
+     to define a task library for these command processors.
+
+     Another reason PDS subcommands might not work is improper syntax.
+     The vast majority of subcommands require a "member name" or "member
+     group" specification as the first positional operand.  Exceptions
+     to this are the following commands:
+
+     CHANGE   COMPRESS CONTROL  DSNAME   END      EDREC    EXEC
+     FIXPDS   ISPF     ISPMODE  ISPXEQ   OPTIONS  RECALL   TSO     USAGE
+
+     Consider the following scenario...a new user is staring at a
+     MEMLIST display in dialog (aka ISPMODE) mode.  They want to find a
+     string in all members in the MEMLIST display.  They enter the
+     following command:
+
+       FIND 'a needle in a haystack'
+
+     which returns an error message about an invalid member name.
+
+     In order to search all of the members displayed in the MEMLIST
+     table, you first must make the current member group equal to
+     all members in the MEMLIST display.
+
+     SUBLIST = MEMLIST
+     FIND * 'a needle in a haystack'
+
+     Note:  See Faq #13 for additional info on invalid subcommands.
+
+ 2.  Why doesn't the FIND command work?
+
+     In dialog mode, there are two different "find" commands.
+
+     "F"    is find in table (Log, MEMLIST, LISTA, LISTF, LISTV, ...)
+     "FInd" is find in member(s) data
+
+ 3.  How do I get HELP?
+
+     In dialog mode, there are prompting panels for each subcommand.
+     Enter "O" or "O.subcommand" to display the prompt panel.  A
+     quick reference pop-up display panel is available via the QR
+     special dialog command.  For line command help, enter "O",
+     "/", or "?" in the line command area to the left.
+
+     To display the TSO HELP member for PDS, just enter "H" or "HEL"
+     to invoke full-screen help.  You can jump to the subcommand
+     help section by entering "H subcommand".
+
+       Note:  The &CHEL global variable must be set to 'HEL'
+       in order to use full-screen help.
+
+     The dialog "FN" command will display a PDS Function Selection
+     panel.
+
+ 4.  After exiting the ISPF tutorial via PF3, and attempting to
+     immediately scroll left via PF10 on the next keystroke, why
+     do I get the error message, "LEFT    " is not active?
+
+     Press Enter immediately after exiting the tutorial, then the
+     LEFT and RIGHT user variables will be set and function
+     correctly.
+
+ 5.  Why does the following IF command fail in batch mode?
+
+     //TSO      EXEC  PGM=IKJEFT01
+     //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=name.of.pds.loadlib,DISP=SHR
+     //SYSTSPRT DD  SYSOUT=*
+     //SYSTSIN  DD  *
+     pds 'sys1.nucleus' volume(npsrs1)
+     if a:z sctr noalias then(map * relink)
+     end
+
+     IF does not allow any operands on subcommands in the
+     THEN or ELSE clauses.  If you use SUBLIST in the THEN
+     clause, the current member group (*) can be used on a
+     subsequent subcommand.  For example,
+
+     pds 'sys1.nucleus' volume(npsrs1)
+     if a:z sctr noalias then(sublist)
+     map * relink
+     end
+
+ 6.  Why does message PDS856E STOW ERROR, R15=16, R0=00000001
+     display after FIXPDS RESET subcommands on small PDS's
+     with one or two directory blocks?
+
+     This only happens if the PDS has a one track extent
+     and less than 3 directory blocks.  Use FIXPDS RESET(3).
+
+ 7.  Why does message PDS715E NO MATCHING ATTRIBUTES WERE FOUND
+     display in the ISPMODE log after an Edit line command was
+     entered in the MEMLIST table?
+
+     Check the "Set MEMLIST Defaults" for Auto member update: YES.
+     YES means that after every EDIT a MEMLIST is run on the whole
+     directory for changed members (based on date and time).  If
+     there were no changes, message PDS715E will display.
+
+ 8.  Why do I get a data truncation error on a CAX line command?
+
+     ***********************************************************
+     * ISPV006
+     *
+     * Data truncation occurred
+     * Data for CHAR format variable "PDSLN1" was too long.
+     *
+     ***********************************************************
+
+     If you are running with the &LOGWIDE global variable set
+     to YES, then you need to copy clist PDSTRAPW as PDSTRAP
+     into your SYSPROC concatenation.  See member $$$TRAP.
+
+ 9.  What causes a S0C4 on a USAGE ALL for a PDSE dataset?
+
+     This happened when running PDS from an APF library.  The
+     problem has been fixed in the 8.6.08 level of PDS.
+
+ 10. I am trying to include a lot of members in a sublist, but
+     I get an error message.
+
+     //TSO      EXEC  PGM=IKJEFT01
+     //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=pds.loadlib,DISP=SHR
+     //SYSTSPRT DD  SYSOUT=*
+     //SYSTSIN  DD  *
+     pds 'your.dataset'
+     sublist (membera, memberb, memberc, memberd, membere, +
+              memberf, memberg, memberh, memberi, memberj, +
+              memberk, memberl, memberm, membern, membero, +
+              memberp, memberq, memberr, members, membert, +
+              memberu, memberv, memberw, memberx, membery, +
+              memberz, member1, member2, member3, member4)
+     IKJ56702I INVALID MEMBER NAME
+
+
+     This is because the maximum subcommand size is 256 characters.
+     Use multiple sublist subcommands with the current member
+     group designator (*) to keep adding members.
+
+     sublist (   membera, memberb, memberc, memberd, membere)
+     sublist (*, memberf, memberg, memberh, memberi, memberj)
+     sublist (*, memberk, memberl, memberm, membern, membero)
+     sublist (*, memberp, memberq, memberr, members, membert)
+     sublist (*, memberu, memberv, memberw, memberx, membery)
+     sublist (*, memberz, member1, member2, member3, member4)
+
+ 11. How do I display PDS message numbers in output messages?
+
+     Enter the TSO command, PROFILE MSGID.
+
+ 12. How do I find all ISPF PACKed members and turn off packing?
+
+     find : x000140C6x then(sublist)  /* if RECFM=F */
+       |
+       or
+       |
+       v
+     find : x000140E5x then(sublist)  /* if RECFM=V */
+     edit * macro(PACKOFF)
+
+     <packoff>
+     ISREDIT MACRO
+     CONTROL NOMSG NOFLUSH NOLIST NOCONLIST NOSYMLIST
+     ISREDIT PACK = OFF
+     ISREDIT END
+
+ 13. ------ PDS Error Prompt Panel ------ Invalid option
+
+     COMMAND ===> control listenv
+
+     The above command is invalid or has invalid operands,
+     correct and enter.
+
+
+     When running the following dialog functions, you can only
+     issue "function specific" commands that are defined in
+     the PDS dialog command table (@DIATBL).
+
+     Option   Function     -- Description --
+     LA     - LISTA        Allocation list
+     LF     - LISTF        File list
+     LV     - LISTV        Volume list
+     CAX    - CAX          Active catalog list
+     TCT    - TCT          TSO command table
+
+ 14. When I enter "TSO PDS" from the ISPF Command prompt
+     message PDS100I does not display like it does
+     when entered from the TSO READY prompt.
+
+     If PDS was generated with the automatic ISPMODE
+     (&ISPOPT SETC 'ISPMODE') option, then you will
+     not receive message PDS100I with the dataset
+     prompt in ISPF.
+
+     To force message PDS100I to display, issue:
+
+     Command ===> tso pds / xispmode
+
+       PDS100I PDS -- VERSION 8.6.13.0  FEBRUARY 29, 2012
+
+       IKJ56700A ENTER NAME OF DATA SET -
+
+ 15. The ISPMODE session ends unexpectedly with no message
+     after I enter a subcommand.
+
+     When running in ISPMODE, certain error conditions
+     cause PDS to end without displaying the error message.
+
+     One example is message PDS832E DUMMY MEMBER ADD
+     FAILED, RC=8.  This can be caused by trying to REPRO
+     a null member.  Start PDS in line mode (or suspend
+     ISPMODE) and run the subcommand again.  You will see
+     the error message.
+
+ 16. LI * NONUM does not display PDS002I before first member.
+
+     Workaround:
+     LI dummy nonum
+     <PDS subcommand to build a sublist of members>
+     LI
)Init
)PROC
)END
