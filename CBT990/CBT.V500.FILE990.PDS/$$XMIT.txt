The members in TSO Transmit (XMIT) format have a userid of XMIT for easy
identification.

To process these you need to use the TSO RECEIVE command:

   RECEIVE INDS(XMIT.PDS(xmit-member))

Then the 1st prompt is the data set name for the member to be processed into -
this will be a PDS.  The default may be adequate for you, if not then use a
reply of the form DS(new.tool.pds).

Then review the members in the newly created PDS for installation and use
instructions.
