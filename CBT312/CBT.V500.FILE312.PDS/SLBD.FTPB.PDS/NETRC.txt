With the 1.230 release the user may now specify that they want to use a
pre-allocated and populated NETRC data set in lieu of specifying a password.
Note that the userid is still required for other uses.

The format of a NETRC data set is:

# comment record
MACHINE target-host LOGIN userid PASSWORD password

Notes:
1. target-host may be a hostname or a I.P. address.
2. the password is in plain text (you're security staff won't like that)

RECOMMENDATION:

   You *SHOULD* issue the following RACF command to prevent anyone other
   than you from reading your NETRC data set and gaining access to your
   userid and password:

   ADDSD netrc-dsn UACC(NONE)
   PERMIT netrc-dsn ACCESS(ALTER) ID(userid)

I don't know how to do this with CA-ACF2 or CA-Top Secret so if you have one
of those then you'll need to contact your mainframe security admin for help.
