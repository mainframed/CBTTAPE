                      VERSION 2.8 AS OF 10/11/84
0SUMMARY OF AMENDMENTS:  THE FOLLOWING  CHANGES BRING THIS MANUAL TO
 LEVEL 2.8:
  THE USE OF THE @ CHARACTER FOR RUN-TIME VALUES IS STRESSED.
  THE DYNAMIC  ALLOCATION MACROS WILL  TAKE ADDRESSES OF  VALUES NOT
 KNOWN AT ASSEMBLY  TIME.  TO INDICATE THAT  AN OPERAND OF A  DDD OR
 FREE MACRO IS AN ADDRESS OF A VALUE RATHER THAN A VALUE ITSELF, ADD
 THE CHARACTER '@' TO THE END OF AN RX-TYPE ADDRESS IN THE OPERAND.
  THE FOLLOWING CHANGES BRING THIS MANUAL TO LEVEL 2.7:
  MINOR ENHANCEMENTS TO THE EXPLANATION OF THE USE OF THE @ SIGN.
  THE FOLLOWING CHANGES BRING THIS MANUAL TO LEVEL 2.6:
  THE DCB=BUFNO KEYWORD,  THE DCB=KEYLEN KEYWORD,  THE FIRST OR ONLY
 SUBPARAMETER  OF  THE   COPIES  KEYWORD,   AND  THE   VOLUME  COUNT
 SUBPARAMETER OF THE  VOLUME KEYWORD OF THE DDD MACRO  ARE NO LONGER
 LIMITED TO VALUES LESS THAN 128.
  THE DDD  MACRO SUPPORTS THE FOLLOWING  OPERANDS WHICH MAY  BE USED
 ONLY    WHEN   EXECUTING    UNDER    MVS/XA:    BURST=,     CHARS=,
 COPIES=(,(GROUP,VALUES)), FLASH=, MODIFY=, UNIT=(,,DEFER).
  THE DEFAULT  ERROR EXIT  HAS BEEN  CHANGED TO  INVOKE IKJEFF18  TO
 WRITE A WTO DESCRIBING THE ERROR.
  THE  MACROS WILL  WORK  IN 31-BIT  ADDRESSING  MODE UNDER  MVS/XA.
 (SINCE IKJEFF18  OPERATES IN 24-BIT  ADDRESSING MODE,   THE DEFAULT
 ERROR  EXIT ROUTINE  SHOULD  NOT BE  USED IF  THE  LITERAL POOL  OR
 WORKING STORAGE ARE ABOVE THE 16 MEGABYTE LINE.)
  THE USE OF '@' FOR SPECIFYING TEXT UNIT PARAMETER VALUES NOT KNOWN
 AT ASSEMBLY TIME IS NOW DOCUMENTED.
  THE KEYADDS KEYWORD  OF THE DDD,  DDI AND FREE  MACROS WILL ACCEPT
 ADDRESSES OF FULLWORDS POINTING TO TEXT UNITS.

0     THE DYNAMIC ALLOCATION MACROS (DDD, FREE, CONCAT, DDDD,  DDTU)
      CONSTRUCT THE  REQUEST BLOCK  AND TEXT  UNIT ADDRESS  LIST FOR
      DYNAMIC ALLOCATION, ISSUE THE "DYNALLOC MACRO" (SVC 99),  TEST
      THE RETURN CODE,   AND IF IT IS  NOT 0,  ABEND OR  BRANCH TO A
      USER-SPECIFIED RECOVERY ROUTINE.
       THE DYNAMIC  ALLOCATION MACROS PERFORM  "DYNAMIC ALLOCATION",
      "DYNAMIC UNALLOCATION" AND "DYNAMIC CONCATENATION".
0      THOSE OPERANDS OF THE MACROS THAT HAVE EQUIVALENTS IN THE JCL
      DD STATEMENT MAY ALL BE CODED THE  SAME WAY AS THEY ARE IN JCL
      (WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS NOTED IN THIS MANUAL).   THOSE OPERANDS
      THAT SPECIFY  NUMERIC  VALUES  MAY  ALSO   BE  CODED  AS  NON-
      RELOCATABLE ASSEMBLER EXPRESSIONS.
       AS  SUPPORT  FOR TEXT  UNIT  PARAMETER  VALUES NOT  KNOWN  AT
      ASSEMBLY  TIME,  ANY  OPERAND  WHOSE  CORRESPONDING TEXT  UNIT
      CONTAINS A  PARAMETER VALUE  (WITH A  FEW EXCEPTIONS  NOTED IN
      THIS MANUAL)   MAY BE CODED  AS AN RX-TYPE  ADDRESS EXPRESSION
      FOLLOWED BY THE CHARACTER '@'.  THE RX-TYPE ADDRESS MUST POINT
      TO STORAGE  CONTAINING THE  VALUE TO BE  PLACED INTO  THE TEXT
      UNIT FOR THAT OPERAND.  VALUES FOR OPERANDS OF VARYING LENGTHS
      MUST  BE PADDED  TO THE  MAXIMUM LENGTH  ALLOWED.  THE  MACROS
      SUPPLY THE TEXT UNIT KEY, NUMBER AND LENGTH.
       THEY USE  GLOBAL SYMBOLS  TO DETERMINE THE  LENGTH OF  A WORK
      AREA AND WHETHER CERTAIN FEATURES HAVE BEEN USED.
       FULL DOCUMENTATION ON  THE USE OF DYNAMIC  ALLOCATION AND SVC
      99 IS  IN OS/VS2 SYSTEM  PROGRAMMING LIBRARY:   JOB MANAGEMENT
      (GC28-0627-1)  OR  MVS/XA SYSTEM PROGRAMMING  LIBRARY:  SYSTEM
      MACROS AND FACILITIES (GC28-1150-1).   JCL REFERENCE IS OS/VS2
      MVS JCL (GC28-0692-3).
       EXAMPLE:  ALLOCATE DDNAME SYSUT1 TO A DATASET WHOSE NAME WILL
      NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL RUN TIME.
0     * ALLOCATE THE DATASET WHOSE NAME IS IN THE 44 BYTES FROM MYWORK+16
      *  THRU MYWORK+59 WITH MEMBER NAME IN THE 8 BYTES BEGINING 2 BYTES
