* I have attempted to translate this documentation into English.
* Please excuse my poor Spanish.   (S.Golob)
*
* This contains a collection of utilities, which include the full
* program, and a JCL example.  There are REXX, CLIST, EDIT MACROS, etc.
*
* All of the information is in 2 libraries:
*
*  FILE 480 Source   (includes everything, except executable modules)
*  FILE 481 Loadlib  (includes the executables, some of which need APF
*                     authorization.)
*
* I think that the most interesting things are:
*    VERDSN, Used to find a file among all the disk packs in an
*            installation
*  CKLOCMEM, Used to find a member of a pds, among all the pds'es
*            in the entire installation
*    CKDATE, This is a method of controling the steps of a JCL
*            stream, depending on the date and the hour
