//***FILE 413 is from Ashley Street and contains a collection       *   FILE 413
//*           of TSO and REXX utilities whose flavor is largely     *   FILE 413
//*           borrowed from VM.  So if you're a former VM'er who    *   FILE 413
//*           has to work on TSO, this stuff is for you.  It may    *   FILE 413
//*           even be very useful, if you're not a former VM'er.    *   FILE 413
//*           Very much worth a try....                             *   FILE 413
