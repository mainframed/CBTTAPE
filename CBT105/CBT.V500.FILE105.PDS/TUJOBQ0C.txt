+ Command ===>_ZCMD
+
+  Upon entry to the 3.8 JOB Queue Processor, a list of all JOBS will be
+ displayed.  This list is constructed from the results of the TSO STATUS
+ command. It is important to note that the list of JOBS is static. For
+ example, if 3.8 were selected during a time when a JOB was still
+ EXECUTING, the resulting JOB list would indicate this. After the JOB
+ completes execution, the user is typically notified on the terminal and
+ the JOB is now on the OUTPUT queue and ready to be processed by 3.8.
+ However, the static JOB list displayed will continue to indicate that
+ the JOB is still executing. This is a fallacy. The JOB is indeed ready
+ to be processed by 3.8 despite the EXECUTING indicator. If desired, the
+ list of displayed JOBS may be refreshed anytime via the ST command.
+ This is equivalant to entering the TSO STATUS command.
+
+  At all times during the JOB list display, a ROW indicator appears in
+ the upper-right portion of the screen in the format "ROW x/y".  The "x"
+ indicates the row or line number of the top displayed JOB.  The "y"
+ indicates to total number of rows (JOBS) available for processing.
+ Consider a display containing 30 JOBS. A value of "ROW 12/30" would
+ reveal that a scroll UP (PF7) would be required to display the first 11
+ JOBS. A scroll DOWN (PF8) would be required to view any remaining JOBS.
+ Note that a maximum of 23 JOBS can be displayed on a single screen.
