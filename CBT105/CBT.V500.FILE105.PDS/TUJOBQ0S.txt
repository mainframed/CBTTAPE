%TUTORIAL ----  A B L  JOB Queue Processor: SELECT JOB Option  ------- TUTORIAL
+
+ Command ===>_ZCMD
+
+  Selecting Option "S" results in the display of the JOB on the terminal.
+ JOBS are viewable on the terminal only when the held output class (Q) is
+ requested before JOB submission.  Specifically, the JCL used to submit
+ the JOB must have specified the MSGCLASS=Q operand on the "JOB" card.
+ If multiple JOBS are selected, the list of selected JOBs will be pro-
+ cessed in a top-down fashion. Pressing PF3 (or entering the END command)
+ will exit the display of the currently selected JOB .... the next
+ selected JOB will then be automatically displayed .... and so on.
+
+  Note that the 3.8 list of JOBs does not differentiate between JOBS on
+ the held output queue versus JOBs on the normal PRINT output queue.
+ Should a JOB that is on the PRINT (i.e., not held) queue be selected for
+ viewing on the terminal, a message will be issued indicating that the
+ JOB selected is%NOT A VIEWABLE JOB+.
+
+  Once a JOB has been viewed on the terminal, it may be Printed, Deleted,
+ or simply left on the queue for viewing again at a later date. Note that
+ held JOBS are automatically deleted from the queue after 7 days.
