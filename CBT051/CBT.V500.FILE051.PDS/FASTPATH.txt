          Product Description

          ReMember is an IBM Mainframe Source PDS (Partitioned
          Data Set) backup and recovery tool.  ReMember backs up
          only those members of a PDS(E) that have changed since
          the previous backup.  Remember also keeps track of all
          versions of every member of a PDS and allows easy
          recovery of any member from previous versions.

           Because ReMember uses highly efficient compression
          technologies and only backs up members that have
          changed since previous backups, every previous version
          of every source member resides on DASD.  These
          features allow ReMember to quickly and easily restore
          a PDS member using either the ISPF Dialog Manager
          panels provided with the product or a simple batch
          job.

          You do not have to wait for someone in DASD management
          to restore a previous version of your library from
          tape and then select the one member that you need
          restored and move that back to the original library.
          You can do the job yourself in a matter of seconds.

          Do you need to see what changes have been made to a
          particular source member over the past year?  Simple!
          Do a compare between any previous version and the
          current version and your job is done.
