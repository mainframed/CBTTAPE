//***FILE 646 is an automation tool from IBM, to convert a CLIST    *   FILE 646
//*           to a REXX exec.  This code has been released to a     *   FILE 646
//*           public LISTSERV, so I assume it is in the public      *   FILE 646
//*           domain already.  I am including, as members $$NOTE1   *   FILE 646
//*           and $$NOTE2, the pieces of LISTSERV transcripts,      *   FILE 646
//*           with their respective dates, as an indication that    *   FILE 646
//*           it is probably OK to distribute this code.  Also      *   FILE 646
//*           see member $$INTRO for hints how to install and       *   FILE 646
//*           run this tool.                                        *   FILE 646
//*                                                                 *   FILE 646
//*           I've included a "before" and "after" example of a     *   FILE 646
//*           CLIST which was converted to a REXX.  The conversion  *   FILE 646
//*           was not completely automatic, but with a few minor    *   FILE 646
//*           adjustments, is was made to work OK.  The CLIST       *   FILE 646
//*           member is called DOCFIL, and the converted REXX is    *   FILE 646
//*           called DOCFILX.                                       *   FILE 646
//*                                                                 *   FILE 646

//*                   sbgolob@attglobal.net                         *   FILE 646
//*                                                                 *   FILE 646
