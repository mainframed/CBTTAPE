 CBT origin : Extracted from CBT tape JUN 84, file 300.
 ------------

 Purpose :   ZAP (under TSO). This service will display any type
 ---------   of data-set (excluding ISAM) in dump format, accept
   various display formatting and modifying commands, and apply
   interactive changes as does IBM's Service Aid IMASPZAP (superzap).
   Hardcopy lines are printed for all data-set modifications and
   "potential modifications" (those not yet applied) as well as
   comments and dumped blocks. The following conditions cause a line
   to be written into the print file : accessing a data-set, ZAPping
   a block, storing in the buffer (S,X,O,N, or SET), selecting a
   member, creating a comment, ejecting a page, or dumping a block
   or blocks. The file will be printed only if an explicit dump,
   comment, or permanent change is made. The file is actually released
   for printing upon exit from the data-set. IDR's are updated in load
   module data-sets in the format superzap uses (with TSO--UUU as
   the ID data field). END-OF-FILEs may be jumped to view data beyond
   up to the extent of the data-set (usefull if an inadvertant EOF was
   written in the middle of a data-set).

 Syntax : ZAP 'DSNAME' VOLUME('SERIAL') CRT NOT3270
 --------     TERSE/VERBOSE
              NOLOG/LOG
              ALLOCDSN('DSNTOALLOC')

          Required : 'DSNAME'
          Defaults : TERSE, NOLOG
                     No volume implies a cataloged data-set.

          Note : usage of the ALLOCDSN keyword is required only for
                 the 'DSNAME' of FORMAT4.DSCB.

                                                      ZAP       2/7.

 Operands :
 ----------
  'DSNAME' - the name of the data-set to be ZAP'd.

  VOLUME   - the volume serial on which the data-set resides.
             The volume must be online and RESIDENT or STORAGE.

  CRT      - conditions ZAP to display four lines on either side of the
             current position in the file.

  NOT3270  - inhibits use of full screen display mode on a 3270-type
             terminal and implies line by line display mode.

  LOG      - conditions ZAP to log to SYSOUT all ZAP transactions to
             the file. Note that ZAP may be put in the logging state
             after it has been entered by use of the LOG command, and
             that use of nay of the DUMP commands causes ZAP to
             automatically enter the logging state.
             The LOG goes to SYSOUT(A) unless DDNAME ZAPLOG is
             pre-allocated to wherever you want it to go.

  NOLOG    - suppress the hardcopy LOG.

  ALLOCDSN - specifies the name of a cataloged data-set on the same
             volume as the one to be ZAPped. ZAP will allocate this
             data-set, but open the one given in the first operand.
             Usage of this keyword is required for FORMAT4.DSCB
             references. Note that a FORMAT4.DSCB reference is a
             priviledged operation.

  TERSE /VERBOSE -
             conditions ZAP to omit the positional WHERE information
             when displaying a portion of the file.

  VERBOSE /TERSE -
             conditions ZAP to give the positional WHERE information
             when displaying a portion of the file.

                    -- The operands are entered after the
                       command, with no intervening blanks.
                    -- The block is read into a work buffer,
                       where you modify it. When you enter a
                       "ZAP" command, the block is written
                       back to the data-set from the buffer.
                       If any other JOB or USER has updated
                       that block in between when you first
                       displayed it and when you "ZAPped"
                       it, the other changes will be lost.

                    -- If you make changes to a block, to
                       go to another block you must either
                       "ZAP" the block (re-write it to the
                       data-set), or enter the command twice
                       in a row which will cause you to
