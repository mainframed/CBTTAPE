zSync is an ISPF Dialog that will compare two, non-load library,
partitioned data sets. The user will be presented with a ISPF table with
all listed members along with the state of each member. The state will
indicate if the member is eligible to be copied.

All default comparisons to determine copy eligibility are done using
ISPF Services.  If either, or both, members have no ISPF stats then the
members are compared using the ISPF Edit compare and the state and copy
eligible flag are then set accordingly.

Note: Truncation can occur if the source PDS has a larger LRECL than
      the target PDS. When this is detected the dialog informs the user
      via messages on the member display panel with the RECFM and LRECL
      of the From and To libraries and a warning message.

The available Commands are:

   Copy       Copy all eligible members
              Copy information is placed in the ISPF Log

 The option must follow the \ and may be:

        valid options:

        all             ignore ispf stats and do a compare on all
                        members
        once            process and then exit
        only            allowed with either other option and only
