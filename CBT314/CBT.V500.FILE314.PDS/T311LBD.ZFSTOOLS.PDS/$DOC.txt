zFSTools is an ISPF dialog that combines home grown and IBM dialogs to
assist and simplify the management of zFS datasets. With this dialog you
can backup a zFS dataset to a unloaded sequential dataset, restore a zFS
dataset from a backup, allocate a new zFS, grow the size of a zFS, access
many of the zfsadm functions (grow is one of them), mount and unmount
filesystems, and even rename a zFS dataset. All with comparitive ease thanks
to the ISPF menus and panels.

Some of the functions require that the user have the ability to become
a SuperUser and if you have that ability then those functions (e.g. mount,
unmount, grow) will work very well. If not, then find someone who can do
it for you.

The backup and restore functions work with any unmounted zFS dataset and
support using a GDG for the backup dataset if desired using relative GDG
numbers.

The dialog is accessed by starting with the ISPF Panel ZFSMENU.

To simplfy use you can edit the ZFSTOOLS exec to point to the install
datasets (exec and panels) and then install just the ZFSTOOLS exec into
an allocated library in your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC concatenation.

Some of the REXX exec's included are:

   ZFSADM   - perfrom several of the zfsadm functions
   ZFSALLOC - to allocate and format a new zFS (as a type 1.5)
   ZFSBACK  - to backup a zFS to a sequential dataset
              - uses IDCAMS REPRO
              - make backup to a gdg
              - Note that if the zFS to be backed up is mounted then
                the code, using the sysdsn() function, gets a dataset
                not found result. Strange but it does prevent an
                attempt to backup an active zFS.
   ZFSCOPY  - Generate ADRDSSU JCL to copy a zFS
 * ZFSGROW  - increase the size of a mounted zFS
   ZFSIBM   - exec to access some of the IBM zFS dialogs
              - Mount Table by File System
              - Mount Table by Mount Point
              * not supported prior to z/OS 2.2
   ZFSMENU  - Simple exec to display the ZFSTools Menu Panel
   ZFSMNT   - Mount a file system using the IBM Mount dialog
              - if z/OS 2.1 then use custom dialog
   ZFSRENAM - rename the zFS base and data datasets
   ZFSREST  - to restore a zFS unloaded dataset
            - uses IDCAMS REPRO
            - can create a new zFS
            - can delete a current zFS before allocating a new
              zFS and reloading
            - can restore from a gdg
   ZFSTOOLS - exec to altlib and libdef for this application if you
              don't install in ispf allocated libraries
   ZFSUMNT  - UnMount using the IBM Mount Table by File System
              - if z/OS 2.1 then use custom dialog
   ZFSUSE   - Display information about zFS usage

   * - these functions require SU authority

Members of this PDS are:

    $DOC    - what you are reading
    EXEC    - TSO Transmit of the REXX Library
    PANELS  - TSO Transmit of the ISPF Panel Library
    $RECV   - TSO Command to RECEIVE EXEC and PANELS into
              usable datasets

Dependencies:
  - This ISPF dialog utilizes the STEMEDIT utility which can be found
    on the CBTTape FILE 183.
  - Some elements of the dialog require the user to have SuperUser
    capability.
  - the zLSOF option on the menu requires access to SYS1.SBPXEXEC where
    IBM ships this exec
