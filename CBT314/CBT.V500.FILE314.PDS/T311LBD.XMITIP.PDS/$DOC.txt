NOTE: A STEPLIB or update to linklist is now required to use this code.

Installation Step 1:
    To execute the RECEIVE member issue
       "TSO EXEC 'hlq.pds-dsname(RECEIVE)' EXEC"
    This will create the rexx, panels, etc. libraries and place you in
    ISPF Browse on some key members.
Installation Step 2.
    Update XMITIPCU - see the Installation Guide.

Optional packages that you might need/want:

         TXT2PDF used for the text to PDF conversion
                 for file attachments

Updates and the optional packages can be found

For Disclaimer support:

Update XMITIPCU variable with the fully qualified data set name of a
data set which contains your installations standard disclaimer.  The
contents of this data set will be included with every e-mail for which a
message is generated.

IMPORTANT: Local customizations should be made in the XMITIPCU rexx
exec and in the XMITLDAP rexx exec:

  XMITIPCU - general customizations
  XMITIPDT - change NLS days and months if not English
  XMITLDAP - customizations related to the use of ldap to verify and/or
             find e-mail addresses.
  XMITIPML - you may need to customize this exec if the ldap server
             returns information in a format different from what
             is defined. (if you change this you should remember what
             you changed for future updates and if you can generalize
             what you've done let me know).
             PLUS you may need to change the comments on the panel
             XMITIPML.

If you need to change the dollar symbol to a pound or you need to change
the PDF ebcdic->ascii translation table then you need to update
XMITIPTR.

   e.g. For the dollar to pound change location 5B to be A3
