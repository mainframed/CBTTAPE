//***FILE 314 is from Lionel Dyck in Austin, Texas and contains     *   FILE 314
//*           quite a few ISPF interface packages, and other        *   FILE 314
//*           stuff.                                                *   FILE 314
//*                                                                 *   FILE 314
//*           The member list probably more accurately reflects     *   FILE 314
//*           the contents of this file, than does the description  *   FILE 314
//*           of some details, below.  This file is constantly      *   FILE 314
//*           being revised.  For reference, please see Lionel's    *   FILE 314
//*           web site at:   http://www.lbdsoftware.com             *   FILE 314
//*                                                                 *   FILE 314
//*    Lionel Dyck's large collection of utilities has now been     *   FILE 314
//*    divided between Files 312, 313, 314, and 969.  All member    *   FILE 314
//*    names beginning with A-R are on File 312.  Names beginning   *   FILE 314
//*    with S-TS are on File 313.  Names from TX-Z are on File      *   FILE 314
//*    314.  File 969 contains the PDSEGEN ISPF application to      *   FILE 314
//*    exploit the capabilities of using PDSE Version 2 member      *   FILE 314
//*    generations.                                                 *   FILE 314
//*                                                                 *   FILE 314
//*    These four files contain quite a few separate utility        *   FILE 314
//*    packages which are unrelated to each other.  You can tell    *   FILE 314
//*    which members of these files belong to the same utility      *   FILE 314
//*    package, by the similarities in their member names.          *   FILE 314
//*                                                                 *   FILE 314
//*    Some utility packages will have several member names         *   FILE 314
//*    associated with them.  But these should all be similar       *   FILE 314
//*    to each other, letting you know that they belong to the      *   FILE 314
//*    same utility package.  You can see this, by looking at       *   FILE 314
//*    the member list shown below, so you can get the idea         *   FILE 314
//*    about how this packaging arrangement works.                  *   FILE 314
//*                                                                 *   FILE 314
//*    Documentation files which are in WORD format, or PDF         *   FILE 314
//*    format, have been included to make the use of the package    *   FILE 314
//*    associated with the doc, easier.  Usually a doc file in      *   FILE 314
//*    FB-80 EBCDIC text, has been included too.  To use the        *   FILE 314
//*    WORD or PDF format documentation, you have to download the   *   FILE 314
//*    member in BINARY to a PC, and look at the resulting file     *   FILE 314
//*    on the PC, using Microsoft WORD, or Adobe ACROBAT reader,    *   FILE 314
