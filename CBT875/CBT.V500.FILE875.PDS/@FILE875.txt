//*           FILE 875 contains the means to build the Algol68C     *   FILE 875
//*           software that corresponds (approximately) to that     *   FILE 875

//*           computing service on its IBM 3084 in 1995.  This      *   FILE 875
//*           software supersedes the earlier pre-release           *   FILE 875
//*           version, which has been on the CBT tape for           *   FILE 875

//*           The 15 files of the AWS-format tape were unloaded     *   FILE 875
//*           as members of this pds, with the ISPF statistics      *   FILE 875

//*           I am hoping to re-package the install procedure       *   FILE 875
