First, thanks to Gilbert Saint-Flour for providing a very early
version of SHOWMVS, so it could be ported to MVS38j.  Gilbert also
had several good suggestions on how to get started.  Thanks Gilbert!


Changes I've made to SHOWMVS (undoubtedly I've forgotten some):

1) Ripped all the macros out of the source, created separate
   members with shorter names

 BEGIN_PROC P$BEGIN
 END_PROC   P$END


2) Renamed long symbols to shorter ones (more than once)

3) $_ changed to QX in one of the macros (STRING?)

4) *8 comments indicate lines removed for MVS38j
   Notable exceptions are routines in which I discarded this
   convention; such routines should have <38j> or something
   similar at the end of their one-line description.  For
   absolute certainty, I'd really recommend a comparison between
   the source Gilbert provided, and mine; I might not always have
   marked the things I changed.

5) <38j> indicate lines inserted for MVS38j

6) Removed ISPF stuff, use PUTLINE instead
   Lines changed for this are not indicated, I got tired of marking changes.

7) Removed RMODE stuff, MVS38j 24-bit only

8) Used STRING v507, since the instructions it uses more closely match MVS38j

IEFEB4UV used to find unit name (probably need to scan DEVNAMET
module ourselves)
