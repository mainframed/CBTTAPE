IEHMAP  -  Version for MVS/ESA

This version contains all the enhancements associated with the 370
version, plus enhancements to support Indexed VTOCs, ICF/VSAM catalogs,
and additional device support. Also the requirement to have a DD
statement referencing the desired pack is removed. If necessary the
volume is dynamically allocated. It is hoped that this version will
continue to function through new releases of ESA and DASD.

**** ADDED FUNCTIONALITY **** ADDED FUNCTIONALITY ****
*
*    Preliminary support for VSAM and ICF catalogs has been added.
*    This will allow the CATLG, DEPT, SPACE, and USERID cards to
*    function.  I wish to thank Mr. Jim Lane of SUNCOR, Inc. for the
*    code in LISTICAT (from the CBT mods tape version 328). This code
*    reads and interprets ICF and VSAM catalogs. Without this code, no
*    catalog support other than the original OS CVOL would be
*    available.
*
*
*    **NOTE WELL**: The ICF/VSAM catalog REQUIRES that IEHMAP be run
*                   authorized. This is because reading the catalog
*                   requires either JFCB password bypass, or the
*                   operator to enter catalog password each time this
*                   is run. The solution in the code is to set the
*                   JFCB password bypass bit during the catalog OPEN,
*                   but this requires running in key 0, which is what
*                   requires authorization.

Known working and broken functions:

1. The SORT and FIXUP functions should still work, but not on volumes
   with active Indexed VTOCs. They do not check for this however.

2. The CATLG, DEPT, SPACE, and USERID functions need the CNAME=
   parameter specified to process ICF and VSAM catalogs. CNAME= should
   be the catalog name and VOL= should be the volume the catalog is on.
   If CNAME= is not specified, then IEHMAP assumes that a CVOL is being
   referenced. Also, if CNAME= specifies a non-VSAM dataset, then it
   assumes that a CVOL is being referenced.

3. The ability to specify more than one catalog via the VOL=(...)
   parameter on the CATLG, DEPT, SPACE, and USERID functions does not
   work with ICF or VSAM catalogs. Only one ICF or VSAM catalog can be
   processed in one function (request card).

4. The other functions based on NAME, TRACKS, and DIR seem to work very
   well.


Changes to output format - same as 370 version

1. The UCB address is put on the output page just after the
   volume serial.
2. Message MAP000I was changed to a double space to save paper.
   It is the message that lists the input card and it seemed
   foolish that a whole page be devoted to that single line.
3. Under XA, no core utilization statistics will be printed.
   The original code depended heavily on the format of OS core
   management, and this was changed greatly in XA.
4. If the password protection bits are set, they are formatted.
   the third column of the "TYP" field will be set to "R" if the
   bits indicate read password needed, and to "W" if the bits
   indicate write password needed.
5. Datasets on volumes that are not cataloged in USERID, DEPT, or SPACE
   operations are flagged as such.


Bugs fixed:

1. Multiple volume datasets and multiple volume catalogs (really
   multiple OS CVOLs) are supported
2. Correct the way the UCB address is extracted.
3. Correct the handling of the L=, MIN=, and MAX= parameters
4. Get the system residence volume address correctly for
   XA mode functioning.
5. Extract the DASD geometry from the system via the DEVTYPE macro.
   This should allow new devices to be supported at once.
6. If an Indexed VTOC is active on the pack, get the freespace map
   via the CVAFDSM macro interface. This allows most of the rest of
   IEHMAP to function normally.
7. If the requested volume is currently not represented in the TIOT,
   dynamically allocate a new DDname to access it.
8. Fixed the handling of more than 16 extents for VSAM datasets. It
   will now properly format up to 99 extents. (Yes, I know that it can
   be up to 127 extents, but the extent field in the printout supports
   only 2 digits, It will cycle around after 99.)
9. If multiple DD statements exist for any volume, only 1 will be
   kept. This mainly affects the CATLG, USERID, and DEPT processing,
   but will also speedup searching in the other functions.
10.Original code would skip the first entry in the first OS CVOL
   block. This is now corrected.


Other changes:

1. Concept and structure of MAPDEV has been changed. It is now an
   active CSECT (has code) and will replace the CATDEV CSECT in
   IEHMAPIN. To properly name new devices, MAPDEV should be modified.

2. Concept and structure of CATDEV has been changed. Only non-DASD
   items will be supported in CATDEV. The DASD items are in MAPDEV.
   CATDEV is now an active CSECT (has code). To properly name new
   devices, CATDEV should be modified.


DASD devices supported:

This version of IEHMAP will correctly identify the following device
types. The definition is in CSECT MAPDEV, with comments showing how
to construct new entries.
