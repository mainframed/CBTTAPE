The original IEHMAP program was to be the "best" pack mapper around. It
did an excellent job of mapping packs and OS CVOLs. However the
anonymous author never updated it and it has since been maintained by
users of the CBT tape.

This file contains an improved version of IEHMAP. Certain modules have
been attacked with the disassembler and then improved. The best version
is that described by $DOC390 and $IN390. This generates a version that
runs under ESA and is an order of magnitude faster than the original
version. The ESA version uses certain system interfaces that may not be
available in older releases of the operating system. A version of IEHMAP
that works on all operating systems (back to OS/MVT) is included, see
$DOC370 and $IN370.

In addition to formatting and describing all known devices at this time,
preliminary support for VSAM/ICF catalogs has been implemented.  See the
$DOCxxx files for a full description of the enhancements.

Added UCBSCAN routine in MAPGRES to find the System Residence volume
for MVS/ESA 4.1.0 and above, if dynamic UCB's are used.     SBG  8/95

Added disassemblies of the original IEHMAP object decks in this file.
Only included are those CSECTs that have not been rendered in source.
These were done with the StarTool object deck disassembler. SBG  8/95
This is to (possibly) make it easier to understand the code.
  Member names are:  SRCMAP,  SRCMAPIN  (to correspond to OBJMAP and
  OBJMAPIN)
ZAPS 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 were fitted to this source.  Scan for the word,
"ZAP" in the disassemblies.
