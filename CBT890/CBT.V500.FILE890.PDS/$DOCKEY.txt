              Documentation Key for SIMULA 360/370
              ------------------------------------

This file comes with the SIMULA Compiler and Library as a load
library in TSO XMIT format.  The rest of the file is documentation
in PDF format, essentially.  Each manual is broken into separate
chapters, which are separate members in this pds, but each
individual manual has a unique prefix.  Below is a guide to each
manual presented here.  These are the original manuals for the
SIMULA system, scanned to produce one PDF for each chapter.

Member names were altered to preserve the proper EBCDIC collating
sequence, so the chapters will be presented in their proper order.


      SUG  -  SIMULA 360 User's Guide
      SPG  -  SIMULA 360/370 Programmer's Guide

      SLP  -  SIMULA Language standard
      SCB  -  SIMULA 67 Common Base Language
      SIG  -  SIMULA Implementation Guide
      SEPL -  External Procedure Library


All of these members are in PDF format, and they have to be
downloaded to a PC in BINARY so you can read them with a PDF
reader such as the Adobe Reader or the Foxit Reader.

There is one programming example called HELLO, which is basically
a "Hello World" program to test the system out.

The members called HELLO1 and HELLO2 were run on z/OS.
See the "BUGS" section in member $GUIDES2.
