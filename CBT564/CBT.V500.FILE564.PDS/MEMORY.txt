./ ADD NAME=$$$NOTE  0101-02141-02142-1002-00029-00001-00000-SBGOLOB

  This member is for the THORNTON member of CBT Tape File 570, a
  general collection of advice "how to do stuff".

  This file refers to Dick Thornton's way of doing stuff.  I have
  included his entire "MEMORY" file from File 564 of the CBT Tape,
  here.  This contains his miscellaneous "how to do stuff" things,
  which is what File 570 is all about.....

  Use PDSLOAD (program from CBT Tape File 093, load module on
  File 035) to create a pds from this member.

  Please refer to Files 558 thru 565 of the CBT Tape for the majority
  of the contributions from Dick Thornton.

  For Dick's other contributions:  Files 217, 234 are disassemblers
                                   Files 568, 569 are old TSO games

***********************************************************************
* MEMORY library: Contains general lore I needed to get the job done. *
*                As I got older and my long and short term memories   *
*                faded, I needed some way to remember how to do those *
*                things I only did once in a while, but were critical *
*                when the need arose. Then all I had to do was        *
*                remember to look in there. This will be of most value*
*                to older System Programers who haven't yet developed *
*                a system of their own. Still, I have provided a      *
*                short description of each member below.              *

|     |                                                                        |
|     |BAL and BALR instructions are the old, pre-virtual instructions for     |
|     |    branching to the second operand address, while including the return |
|     |    address in the first operand register. The difference is that the   |
|     |    BAL and BALR instructions place the Instruction Length Code (ILC),  |
|     |    Condition Code (CC), and Program mask bits in the high order byte   |
|     |    of the R1 register followed by the 24-bit instruction address from  |
|     |    the updated PSW when executing in AMODE=24. When executing in       |
|     |    AMODE=31, BAL and BALR operate exactly like BAS and BASR: the R1    |
|     |    register gets the full rightmost 4 bytes of the updated PSW         |
|     |    including the AMODE bit.                                            |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |LA instruction when operating in AMODE=24 clears the high-order byte of |
|     |    the R1 register to zero, and loads the 24-bit address from the      |
|     |    second operand into the low-order 3 bytes. When executing in        |
|     |    AMODE=31, the R1 register high order bit is set to zero, and the    |
|     |    31-bit second operand address is placed in the low order 31 bits.   |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |BASSM instruction is used to perform routines that may be in a different|
|     |    address mode than the current program. It operates exactly like the |
|     |    BALR and BASR instructions, except that the high order bit of the   |
|     |    second operand register is used to set the PSW AMODE bit. Also, in  |
|     |    AMODE=31, the high order bit of the R1 register is set to '1' while |
|     |    the entire high-order byte of the R1 register is set to zero when   |
|     |    in AMODE=24.                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |BSM  instruction is intended to be used as the standard return from a   |
|     |    performed program whose caller may be in a different addressing     |
|     |    mode, since the full 32-bits of the R2 register replace the roght   |
|     |    hand 4 bytes of the current PSW, including the AMODE bit. For a     |
|     |    non-zero R1, the AMODE bit in the PSW is stored in the high-order   |
|     |    bit of the R1 register before the R2 register is processed.         |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |    addressing mode.                                                    |

|     |01/18/2002             Auxiliary Storage                         AUXSTOR|
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Aux Storage Shortage:                                                   |
|     |1) Will be reported on a particular system (A or B)                     |
|     |2) Often is temporary, caused by DUMPSRV dumping an IMS region.         |
|     |3) Procedure for curing the problem:                                    |
|     |   a) Bring up TMON on the affected system, type Q on the command line  |
|     |      cursor to Auxiliary Storage Status and note the Local Slots       |
|     |      Available %. If near 35% and DUMPSRV is near top of the list it   |
|     |      may improve soon. Watch. If it improves, do nothing.              |
|     |   b) To add a page dataset:                                            |
|     |      1) In TMON, enter Q to get to the Quick Access menu, then cursor  |
|     |         to Page Dataset Allocation and press enter. Note all local     |
|     |         datasets in the list. PAGEx2.LOCAL thru PAGEx7.LOCAL are       |
|     |         assigned at IPL.                                               |
|     |      2) In TSO on the affected system, use =3.4 (=4.1.4 in WB) with    |
|     |         a mask of SYS1.PAGEx* (x is A or B for the system). Look for   |
|     |         the first dataset with a low node of LOCAL2 that is not already|
|     |         allocated. If there are none, try LOCAL3, etc. If none are     |
|     |         available, call the DASD On-Call for space and run the job in  |
|     |         PDS.JCL(DEFPAGEx).                                             |
|     |      3) In TSO on the affected system, use the SYSCON command to get   |
|     |         a console window and enter: PA PAGE=pagedatasetname            |
|     |      4) Using TMON on the affected system, check to see the new page   |
|     |         dataset is allocated, and the shortage removed.                |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | See SYS1.PARMLIB(IEASYS00) for current IPL page datasets.              |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | Jim Price created a spare page dataset for SYSA on PRDM33 named        |
|     | SYS1.PRDM33.LOCAL which is to be used for Aux Storage Shortages only.  |
|     | Also:                                                                  |
|     | SYSA: SYS1.PAGEAK.LOCAL and SYS1.PAGEA0.LOCAL                          |
|     | SYSB: SYS1.PAGEB8.LOCAL                                                |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | MVS messages IRA400E, IRA401E, IRA403E,  and IRA500E signal Pageable   |
|     | storage problems that are not related to page datasets. Use QuickRef   |
|     | to analyze the problem/action. Basically, the available pool of memory |
|     | frames available is very low due to the number of fixed frames. The job|
|     | having the largest number of fixed frames is swapped out until the     |
|     | shortage is relieved.                                                  |
|     |                                                                        |

|     | "START PENDING" problem caused by a pair of reserves for SYSVTOC       |
|     | & SYSIGGV2. Both should be in MSX, but this causes CA7 problems.       |
|     | On system NOT having the START PENDING:                                |
|     |  .F CATALOG,LIST gives a list of active catalog tasks. In column       |
|     |  FLAGS look for OW (oldest wait) and note the ID number and            |
|     |  elapsed time. If elapsed time is about the same as the duration       |
|     |  of START PENDING, abend task:                                         |
|     |  .F CATALOG,END(nn) where nn is the ID from above. This infinite       |

|     | If START PENDINGs continue, repeat. If this doesn't cure the           |
|     | problem, issue these on both systems:                                  |

|     |                       5647A01 V2R6M0 OS/390 C                          |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |To make ISPF edit enter and display square brackets as x'BA' and x'BB": |
|     |In Reflection, select the Setup Menu, then the Terminal option, and     |
|     |check the Country Extended Graphics Code box. In Reflection, select the |
|     |Setup Menu, Keyboard option and UN-select the Show APL Box, then select |
|     |the left-square-bracket key on the top keyboard display. Set the lower  |
|     |display to Commands and enter .TransmitANSI"[". Repeat for the right    |
|     |square bracket.                                                         |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |The above solves the data-entry and display problems with brackets, but |
|     |the value used is not that required by the C compiler, which is x'AD'   |
|     |and x'BD'. To solve this, include a step to execute program CBRAKETS    |
|     |preceding the compile step to convert brackets to compiler values in a  |
|     |temporary file sent to the compiler. See BC0THOR.PDS.JCL(EDCCB).        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Also need terminal type=3277A. In workbench: 0 (Parameter) 1(Terminal)  |
|     |  3277A.                                                                |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |In Reflection, the upper-case 6 (hat symbol) is x'B0' and the ¦ symbol  |
|     |is changed to the solid vertical bar.                                   |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |In C, printf() writes to the SYSPRINT DD, and perror() to SYSOUT        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |The BKT edit macro can be issued to convert brackets to the x'BA' and   |
|     |x'BB' values useful in TSO/ISPF Edit. This is useful for source         |
|     |programs uploaded from the PC, or copied from sample libraries, for     |
|     |example. It also counts and compares the number of left brackets to the |
|     |number of right brackets and reports any discrepancy.                   |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |IBM C Language datasets have high level node CBC. The CBC.SCBCSAM PDS   |
|     |contains a number of sample programs that show how to accomplish many   |
|     |programming tasks in C.                                                 |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |PROCs for use with the C Language begin with the letters ED and have    |
|     |various combinations of compile, pre-link, and linkedit. Also see       |
|     |BC0THOR.PDS.JCL(EDCCB).                                                 |

|     |JCL DD statements for C programs:                                       |
|     |1) SYSPRINT is used for PRINTF output. If omitted, it is dynamically    |
|     |   allocated.                                                           |
|     |2) STDOUT01 is the default output file, STDIN01 is the default input    |
|     |   file, STDERR01 is the default error file. All are dynamically alloc- |
|     |   ated as needed.                                                      |
|     |3) If fopen() specifies a DSNAME, that dataset is allocated, if it      |
|     |   exists, otherwise it is dynamically allocated.                       |
|     |4) If fopen() specifies a DDNAME, the JCL DD statement is used, if      |
|     |   present, otherwise the DD is dynamically allocated to a temporary    |
|     |   dataset that is deleted at end of job.                               |
|     |5) sigioerr() writes to DDNAME SYSOUT. It is dynamically allocated if no|
|     |   found in the JCL.                                                    |

|     |When fopen() specifies a ddname for output, it is dynamically allocated |
|     |to a temporary file if the DD statement is not in the JCL (or if the    |
|     |ddname is mispelled). When a data set name is specified for output, it  |
|     |will be used, if cataloged, otherwise a new dataset will be allocated   |
|     |automatically.                                                          |

|     |   The area pointed to by register 1 begins with X'01' and ends with    |
|     |   X'FF'. Between is one or more 10-byte records, each describing a     |

|     |                        X'40'=all other data types (displayed as-is).   |
|     |      +1 (1) Field length (when data type = X'40', this is X'00')       |

|     |      +3 (1) Display length (when data type = x'80', this is X'00')     |
|     |      +4 (1) Field Origin: X'08' means the field is a literal coded in  |
|     |                           the display statement and is found via R10.  |
|     |                           X'09' means the field is located via a 'cell'|
|     |                           in the TGT pointed to by R13.                |
|     |      +5 (3) Cell Offset. Usually x'000000' when origin is x'08'. For   |
|     |                          Origin X'09' this is the offset added to R13  |
|     |                          to locate the 4-byte 'cell' in the TGT.       |
|     |      +8 (2) Field Offset. The address of the field to be displayed is  |
|     |                           the sum of this offset and the TGT cell (or  |
|     |                           R10 of Origin is X'08')                      |
|     |   Example field for the display of a literal and a packed number such  |
|     |   as: DISPLAY 'TOTAL RECORDS READ = ' RECS-READ.                       |
|     |   R1 points to: X'014000001508000000012620030005090001C40043FF'        |
|     |   First field: X'4000000015080000000126' As-is data, 21 bytes long, a  |
|     |                literal in the display located in the CGT via R10+0126  |
|     |   Second field: X'20030005090001C40043' COMP-3 DATA, 3 bytes long but  |
|     |                requiring 5 bytes in the display area. First find the 4 |
|     |                byte TGT 'cell' at R13+0001C4. The field is located at  |
|     |                cell+0126.                                              |

|     |   After initialization, COBOL II programs maintain the TGT address in  |
|     |   R13. Often the PGT address will be in R12 and the CGT address in R10.|
|     |   The PGT address can be found in a dump at program load point +58 hex.|
|     |   The program start address (after initialization) is found at load    |
|     |   point +68 hex. The instruction at this address is a L  R10,nn(0,R12) |
|     |   where nn is the offset from the PGT to the address of the CGT.       |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |   In XPEDITER, DP programname displays storage at the first instruction|
|     |                               coded in the procedure division.         |
|     |                DP WORKING-STORAGE displays start of working storage.   |
|     |                DP paragraphname displays storage at the paragraph.     |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |                                                                        |
|     |This program exchanges (interchanges two datasets on the same volume so |
|     |that the first DSNAME will point to the second dataset and the second   |
|     |DSNAME will point to the first dataset. Both datasets must already      |
|     |exist in the VTOC of the volume, and neither can be VSAM. This program  |
|     |does not make use of standard catalog and device allocation or serial-  |
|     |ization and so can be used to rename datasets even when they are in use |
|     |by other jobs. To minimize risk, the datasets are interchanged by       |
|     |rewriting the format 1 DSCB's for the two datasets so that the data     |
|     |records are interchanged while leaving the count and key portions       |
|     |as-is. In this way, modifications to the VTICIX are avoided, and no     |
|     |new records need to be created in the VTOC.                             |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |A VOLUME control card must precede the first EXCHANGE control card. It  |
|     |specifies the volume to be used for the EXCHANGEs that follow until     |
|     |another VOLUME control card is found. The VOLUME control card contains  |
|     |the word VOLUME in columns 1-6, blank in column 7, and has the volume   |
|     |serial in columns 8-13 left justified with trailing blanks.             |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |A two-card set is required for each pair of datasets to be interchanged.|
|     |The first contains the word EXCHANGE in columns 1-8, a blank in column  |
|     |9, the word DSN= in columns 10-13, and the full dataset name in columns |
|     |14-57 left justified with trailing spaces. The second card immediately  |
|     |follows the first and is blank in columns 1-9, has the word DSN= in     |
|     |columns 10-13, and the name of the second dataset in columns 14-57.     |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |A card having an asterisk in column 1 is treated as a comment, and is   |
|     |ignored by the program.                                                 |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |When any error is encountered, the program writes log records and       |
|     |terminates with a user abend. In this case, the log file may be very    |
|     |important, and should be studied in detail to determine whether any     |
|     |VTOC damage must be repaired. The VTOC repair can be done using         |
|     |IMASPZAP or CHRDUMP and the information in the log file.                |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |A log file is always written and contains all messages written to the   |
|     |SYSPRINT file as well as the content of all VTOC records read and       |
|     |written. The log file can be used to aid in VTOC recovery in case of a  |
|     |catastrophic error during processing, as it contains the VTOC details.  |
|     |Note that the VTOC records are given in hex, so the file must be viewed |
|     |in hex mode when using TSO EDIT or BROWSE.                              |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |10/02/1998             FILE TRANSFERS (PC <--> Mainframe)            FTP|
|     |                                                                        |
|     |1. If this transfer will be from the PC to the mainframe, be sure the   |
|     |   receiving mainframe PDS exists. Create it if necessary.              |
|     |2. Get out of SPF and to the TSO READY prompt.                          |
|     |3. Click on the File menu item from the Reflections menu. This will give|
|     |   a drop-down list.                                                    |
|     |4. On the drop-down, click on Transfer... to get to the Transfer Window.|
|     |5. Click the Setup... button and check on the IND$FILE tab to see that  |
|     |   the Host System is TSO and the Active Protocol is IND$FILE. If not,  |
|     |   click on the Setup menu item of the Reflection menu and set this up. |
|     |6. Set the Transfer Method to ASCII.                                    |
|     |7. Set If File Exists to Overwrite.                                     |
|     |8. Set Record Format to Fixed.                                          |
|     |9. Set the Drives window to the desired drive.                          |
|     |10. In the Local Directories window, double-click the desired directory.|
|     |11. In the Local File Names window, click the file to be transferred -  |
|     |    or if it is a new file, type the name.                              |
|     |12. In the TSO Host window on the right side middle, click on the       |
|     |    Show Host Files button. This will bring up a moving flashlight and  |
|     |    an hourglass while the mainframe is accessed to obtain a list of    |
|     |    your dataset. If this times out, you may be in ISPF and must get    |
|     |    out to a TSO READY prompt and start over.                           |
|     |13. Click on the desired mainframe directory to highlight it, then click|
|     |    and drag the PC file to it for a PC-to-Mainframe transfer. Or the   |
|     |    large arrow pointing to the right at the top of the window can be   |
|     |    clicked.                                                            |
|     |14. For a mainframe-to-pc transfer of a file shown in the directory     |
|     |    list, click on the file, then on the large left-pointing arrow at   |
|     |    the top of the window.                                              |
|     |15. For a mainframe-to-pc transfer of a member of a PDS, click the PDS  |
|     |    to highlight it, then type the member name in parentheses after the |
|     |    PDS name in the Name(Member/Password window at the top, then click  |
|     |    the large left-pointing arrow to begin transfer.                    |
|     |16. If a different high-level node is desired, try the Level button at  |
|     |    bottom of the window. My experience is that it times out before the |
|     |    directory is built, however. A possibility may be to type the fully |
|     |    qualified name in the Name(Member)/Password window.                 |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |To use IPCS in Workbench, enter workbench with: WB IPCS(Y). The first   |
|     |time you do this, you will see a message "You must create the VSAM file |

|     |    so rename it to another name ending in 'CMDS' such as MYCMDS.       |
|     |    Example: Rename ISPPROF(USERCMDS) ISPPROF(MYCMDS)                   |
|     | 2) Table to be updated must be in the ISPTABL file which is normally   |
|     |    in the dataset BC0THOR.ISPPROF.                                     |
|     | 3) On the Command Table Utility Menu enter the table prefix to be      |
|     |    used in the Application choice. CMDS will be postfixed to this.     |
|     | 4) To Edit a command, enter an "E" to its left, make the desired       |
|     |    changes, then move the cursor to "update" at the bottom and enter.  |
|     | 5) To use a modified table, rename it back to its original name        |
|     |    and get out of ISPF notmally, then get back into ISPF.              |
|     | 6) To install a USERCMDS table, build one using an application name    |
|     |    such as "MY". This creates member ISPPROF(MYCMDS). After finishing  |
|     |    and saving, get out of 3.9 and rename ISPPROF(MYCMDS) to            |
|     |    ISPPROF(USERCMDS) and get out of ISPF, then back in. The USER       |
|     |    application will be set up when the USERCMDS member is seen in      |
|     |    the ISPPROF dataset on ISPF initialization.                         |

|     | Chapter 11 of the IBM manual "ISPF EDIT and EDIT MACROS" contains a    |
|     | list of all the ISREDIT commands.                                      |

|     | Edit macros MUST be invoked from the command line in an ISPF EDIT      |
|     | session. They will NOT work properly if preceded by TSO, or if brought |
|     | in via the =3.9 command facility.                                      |

|     |file pointed to by DDNAME=EDCHKDD. The files is usually a               |
|     |member of HNET.ISPF.CNTLLIB. If HCS PROCs are needed, use               |

|     |intercepts the ! character. To cure this, use the edit                  |
|     |macro in USER02.PDS.CLIST(JC), and only JC is required.                 |

|     |                                                                        |
|     |To make changes to the LNKLST on-the-fly:                               |
|     |1. Enter LOCMOD membername for some member in the dataset(s) to be      |
|     |   modified to be sure it is found in the LNKLST.                       |
|     |2. In SDSF LOG, enter /D PROG,LNKLST, whose display shows the name of   |
|     |   the current LNKLST SET. A listing similar to the below is shown:     |
|     |        CSV470I  16.43.04 LNKLST DISPLAY 697                            |
|     |        LNKLST SET LNKLST00 LNKAUTH=LNKLST                              |
|     |        ENTRY  APF  VOLUME   DSNAME                                     |
|     |          1     A   SYSTST   SYS1.LINKLIB                               |
|     |          2         SYSTS2   SYS1.XROLB                                 |
|     |  The name of the LNKLST SET is LNKLST00 as shown in the 2nd line above.|
|     |3. Note the name of the LNKLST SET, which will be used in the COPYFROM()|
|     |   parameter of the SETPROG,DEFINE command below.                       |
|     |4. Enter /SETPROG LNKLST,DEFINE,NAME(NEWLLSET),COPYFROM(currlnklstset)  |
|     |   which creates a new LNKLST SET identical to the one currently in     |
|     |   use on the system.                                                   |
|     |5. Enter /SETPROG LNKLST,DELETE,NAME(NEWLLSET),DSNAME(dsn-to-be removed)|
|     |   which will remove the named dataset from the NEWLLST list. Additional|
|     |   DELETE commands can be issued at this time, if desired.              |
|     |6. Enter /SETPROG LNKLST,ACTIVATE,NAME(NEWLLSET) which will activate    |
|     |   this new LNKLST SET, but does not affect any system jobs already     |
|     |   running that use the original LNKLST SET.                            |
|     |7. Enter /SETPROG LNKLST,UPDATE,JOB(*) which will result in all current |
|     |   jobs in execution being switched to the newly activated LNKLST SET,  |
|     |   freeing the original one.                                            |
|     |8. Enter /D PROG,LNKLST and check to be sure the active LNKLST SET is   |
|     |   now NEWLLSET.                                                        |
|     |9. You may want to verify that some member in the the dataset(s) removed|
|     |   is no longer available from the LNKLST by using the LOCMOD command.  |
|     |10. Enter /SETPROG LNKLST,UNDEFINE,NAME(original-lnklst-set-name) to    |
|     |   remove the definition of the original lnklst set.                    |
|     |11. Build a 'SYS1.PARMLIB(CSVLLAxx) member that contains a REMOVE state-|
|     |   ment for the dataset(s) that were removed from the new LNKLST SET    |
|     |   so they will be freed for renaming, deleting, editing, or whatever   |
|     |   needs to be done to them. The last two characters of the member      |
|     |   name (xx) are used in the modify command:                            |
|     |      /F LLA,UPDATE=xx                                                  |
|     |12. The modify command will free the dataset(s) from LLA control so that|
|     |   they can be manipulated.                                             |
|     |13. Perform any desired operations against the libraries now, such as   |
|     |   renaming, compressing, recreating, copying into, etc.                |
|     |14. If the original LNKLST SET in 'SYS1.PARMLIB(LNKLST00)' is now ok to |
|     |   be used, activate it by entering /T PROG=00 which will use that      |
|     |   member to rebuild the LNKLST and activate it.                        |
|     |15. Enter /SETPROG LNKLST,UPDATE,JOB(*) to switch all executing jobs    |
|     |   to this LNKLST SET.                                                  |
|     |16. Enter /SETPROG LNKLST,UNDEFINE,NAME(NEWLLSET)  to remove the        |
|     |   definition of NEWLLSET from the system.                              |
|     |17. Enter /D PROG.LNKLST and check to see that the LNKLST SET name is   |
|     |   correct.                                                             |
|     |18. Use the LOCMOD command to insure a member of the original dataset   |
|     |   is again available via the LNKLST.                                   |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |   in K (example, for SYSB on 06/23/93 it is 6312K).                    |
|     |2) Browse SYS1.PARMLIB(IEASYS00) and get the CSA= value,                |
|     |   which represents K. (example, for SYSB 6180K on 6/23)                |

|     |RMF Monitor III is a system monitor particularly valuable for           |
|     |analyzing delays in individual jobs, or system-wide bottlenecks.        |
|     |The monitor is available under TSO when in ISPF, by going to the        |
|     |COMMAND screen, (option 6) and entering RMFWDM. If you have not         |
|     |used RMF before, you will see the message:                              |

|     |                                                                        |
|     | FREF and BREF: These commands cause the report to display the next     |
|     |                interval (FREF) or the previous interval (BREF) for the |
|     |                report being viewed. These commands are especially      |
|     |                useful in doing historical analysis of earlier problems.|
|     |                The interval time is that specified by the RANGE, which |
|     |                can be set by the ROPTIONS command. To reduce keystrokes|
|     |                it is a good idea to set up a PF key for each of these  |
|     |                commands (use the KEYS command).                        |
|     | ROPTIONS: This is normally entered while within a report, rather than  |
|     |           from the primary menu. If entered from the primary menu, you |
|     |           will be asked for a report name. The report options permit   |
|     |           setting the following (press PF3 when finished):             |
|     |            DATE and TIME: Use this to look back at an earlier time, up |
|     |                           to 24-48 hours ago, depending on stored data.|
|     |            RANGE: This is the interval between successive displays. The|
|     |                   minimum is 100 seconds. Use this with the FREF and   |
|     |                   BREF commands.                                       |
|     |            CLASS: Report on ALL jobs, or only on TSO or STC or BATCH.  |
|     |            GROUP: Limit the report to a particular domain or perform-  |
|     |                   ance group.                                          |
|     |            SUMMARY: Include summary lines for CLASS or not.            |
|     |            CRITERION: Specify the lowest delay percentage to be shown  |
|     |                       for the report display. This defaults to 0% so   |
|     |                       that everything is shown, whether delayed or not.|
|     |                       You may find it better to use 5, 10, or more.    |
|     |            JOBS: If you say YES, after you press ENTER, you get a full |
|     |                  screen showing the jobs in the system. You can use    |
|     |                  this to specify the job(s) to be included on the      |
|     |                  report if desired. Place an S to the left of a job    |
|     |                  to include it on the report, or an X to exclude it.   |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | GO: This puts you in automatic update mode, and the date/time will be  |
|     |     set to current time. After each interval of time specified by the  |
|     |     value of RANGE, an updated screen is displayed. When in this mode  |
|     |     your PF keys are not recognized, and you cannot enter commands. To |
|     |     get out of GO mode, press ATTENTION (twice if in Supersession).    |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | DSINDEX: This shows you how much data is available for reporting by    |
|     |          date and time.                                                |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | JOB jjjjjjjj: The JOB command followed by a jobname gives an RMF Job   |
|     |               Delays Display, explaining any delays for the job in     |
|     |               detail. This is very helpful when a job is "hung" or     |
|     |               running very slowly.                                     |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | Cursor sensitivity: While in reports, you can move the cursor to fields|
|     |                     on the screen and press enter. If an expanded      |
|     |                     display is available for the field, it will be     |
|     |                     shown. When PF3 is pressed, you will be returned to|
|     |                     the display you were on before. If a jobname is    |
|     |                     selected at the cursor, the RMF Job Delays screen  |
|     |                     is produced. Other fields result in other displays.|

|     | You must use some judgement in use of these screens. For example, a    |
|     | screen will be shown even if there is absolutely nothing delaying the  |
|     | job. For example, this report shows only 4% delay for processor, and 2%|
|     | for devices, hardly anything to worry about. Also, the 81% workflow    |
|     | indicates the job is getting most of the resources it needs. If the    |
|     | WFL (workflow) is low, it indicates the job is suffering, and then you |
|     | should look to the % Delayed for and Primary Reason columns to locate  |
|     | the problem.                                                           |
|     | The report below was obtained by entering 1 on the Primary Menu. It is |

|     | When in this, or any report, you can scroll forward and back using PF8 |
|     | and PF7, just as in TSO Edit. In addition, you can enter a FIND jjjjjjj|
|     | command on the COMMAND line to locate a particular job. The TOP        |
|     | command will return you to the beginning of the display.               |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | The CRITERION was set to 10 using the ROPTIONS command so that only    |
|     | those jobs delayed 10% or more are displayed.                          |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | When evaluating job performance, first notice the WFL column. This     |
|     | shows the percentage of resources the job wants versus what it gets.   |
|     | A 100 here indicates it is getting all it wants and can use. A 0 here  |
|     | indicates it is getting nothing. Jobs with low WFL values should be    |
|     | evaluated further. If a number of jobs having low WFL values show the  |
|     | same Primary Reason, this may indicate a system-wide bottleneck. In    |
|     | this case, cursor to the name in the Primary Reason column and press   |
|     | ENTER for additional information.                                      |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | If an individual job is to be analyzed, move the cursor to its jobname |
|     | and press ENTER to see the RMF JOBS DISPLAY report which includes any  |
|     | details concerning its delays.                                         |
|     |                                                                        |
|     | When analyzing an earlier time, use the ROPTIONS command to set the    |
|     | date and time, them "walk" forward and back in time using the PF keys  |
|     | you have set up for FREF and BREF. This can provide a graphic picture  |
|     | of the changing environment that often helps understand why a problem  |
|     | occurred. This capability can be used with any of the reports, of      |
|     | course.                                                                |

|     |DEST dest on top line sets the destination, which limits the search.    |
|     |  This cannot be seen easily (use DEST ? to display), and remains fixed |

|     |  line. Since destination is part of search data, this can cause a      |
|     |  user not to see expected jobs, resulting in trouble reports.          |

|     |SMF constantly writes records to the SYS1.MANX and SYS1.MANY datasets.  |
|     |When the current dataset fills, recording automatically switches, and   |
|     |the SMFDUMP job in SYS1.PROCLIB is scheduled to copy the full dataset   |
|     |to a GDG named SMF.DKIn001.SMFDATA(+!). After midnight, job DKIn001A    |
|     |is run, which forces an SMF dataset switch, and writes the final        |
|     |generation of the SMF.DKIn001A.SMFDATA for the day. Later, DKIn002A     |
|     |runs to copy all the generations for the day to a disk resident dataset |
|     |named SMF.DKIn002.RAWDATA.                                              |
|     |When a program that writes SMF records loops, the datasets fill quickly |
|     |and SMFDUMP is scheduled frequently so that at midnight a large number  |
|     |of generations have been created for the day's SMF data. The problem    |
|     |becomes evident later, when job DKIn002A abends SB37 since the huge     |
|     |volume of data will not fit on available DASD. DKIn002A's failure       |
|     |holds up later xKI... jobs, and the O/S SMF routines continue to pump   |
|     |out records. To correct this, you must identify the job that is creating|
|     |the records and get it stopped. Next, DKI0002A must be run successfully |
|     |to write the previous day's SMF data to a tape dataset, rather than to  |
|     |DASD, and the GDG's involved must be properly handled.                  |
|     |1. To find the record type causing the problem, look at job SMFDUMP     |
|     |   in SAR (J) for the system where the problem is happening. Page down  |
|     |   to the Summary Activity Report and look for a record type that is    |
|     |   a large percentage of the total (usually 90+%). Identify this        |
|     |   record's creator and take steps to stop it.                          |
|     |2. In SAR (R) look at the most recent execution of job DKI0001A (SYSB)  |
|     |   or DKI9001A (SYSA) and note the generation number created for        |
|     |   SMF.DKIn001.SMFDATA.GnnnnV00. This is the last generation to be      |
|     |   included in the rerun of DKIn002A which archives yesterday's data.   |
|     |3. Any generations BEYOND this are for today's data, and must be        |
|     |   renamed to prevent their being picked up by the rerun od DKIn002A.   |
|     |   The TSO/ISPF Data Set List Utility (=3.4 in ISPF or 2.4.1.4 in WB)   |
|     |   can be used for this. A good method is to replace the final "0"      |
|     |   with an "X". That should leave a number of generations, with the     |
|     |   last being the one shown in the DKIn001A run.                        |

|     |4. The SMFDUMP proc in SYS1.PROCLIB needs to be modified so that it     |
|     |   cannot run and create any new generation until DKIn002A has been     |
|     |   successfully rerun. When finished, that job will have deleted all    |
|     |   generations of SMF.DKIn001.SMFDATA that it archived. Either "break"  |
|     |   the SMFDUMP PROC so it gets a JCL error when run, or change its      |
|     |   //DUMPOUT DD to use a different dataset name.                        |
|     |5. Call the Command Center and have them add an override to the end of  |
|     |   the DKIn002A job to write the data to a tape, rather than to disk.   |
|     |   The added DD should be:                                              |
|     |      //SORTOUT DD UNIT=3590-1,LABEL=(1,SL,,,RETPD=3)                   |
|     |6. Have the Command Center restart the DKIn002A job after the override  |
|     |   has been added.                                                      |
|     |7. When DKIn002A runs successfully, it will delete all its input        |
|     |   generations for SMF.DKIn001.SMFDATA. Use ISPF 3.4 (or WB 2.4.1.4)    |
|     |   to verify this.                                                      |
|     |8. Use ISPF 3.4 (or WB 2.4.1.4) to rename all the datasets renamed in   |
|     |   step 3 above back to their original names and verify that they are   |
|     |   now cataloged under the SMF.DKIn001.SMFDATA base.                    |
|     |9. If the SMFDUMP job ran during all this and created a new dataset,    |
|     |   it must now be renamed to follow the last generation of the          |
|     |   SMF.DKIn001.SMFDATA group.                                           |

|     |  1. Stop SMR on both systems                                           |
|     |  2. Rename the current SYSLOG.PRD.DAILY.SMRyyddd                       |
|     |  3. Allocate a larger SYSLOG.PRD.DAILY.SMRyyddd if                     |
|     |     possible. This is an SMS managed dataset, and there                |
|     |     may not be enough room. If not, allocate the largest               |
|     |     space possible. NOTE: SMS allocates only 80% of requested space,   |
|     |     so adjust the requested space accordingly. Request 120% of needed. |
|     |  4. If a larger space was available, copy the original                 |
|     |     dataset to the new, larger dataset and scratch the                 |

|     |  6. If insufficient space is available in step 3, wait                 |
|     |     until the next day, when additional space is there                 |
|     |     and SMR is using another dataset, then combine the                 |
|     |     original and second datasets into a single file and                |
|     |     delete the two pieces. USER02.PDS.JCL(SMRCOPY) has                 |

|     |  TMONMVS can be used to obtain information on the busiest DASD         |
|     |  devices, and which datasets are being used on a volume, and           |
|     |  the jobs using these datasets. Following is a procedure for           |
|     |  doing this.                                                           |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  1. At the TMONMVS PRIMARY MENU on the SELECTION line, type            |
|     |     =1.6 and press ENTER. This will bring up the                       |
|     |     I/O CONFIGURATION MONITOR screen.                                  |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  2. Press PF5 to get the DASD ACTIVITY MONITOR screen.                 |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  3. Tab to the % DEV BUSY _ field and press ENTER. This will           |
|     |     sort the display in descending order by % DEV BUSY. The            |
|     |     first device shown will be the busiest. Pressing ENTER             |
|     |     will update the display. (To get back to the                       |
|     |     I/O CONFIGURATION MONITOR screen, press PF3).                      |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  4. Decide which DASD volume is to be analyzed and move the            |
|     |     cursor to its DEV NUM, then press ENTER. This will invoke          |
|     |     the DEVICE DETAIL SELECTION MENU. On the SELECTION line,           |
|     |     type the number 2 and press ENTER. A message will appear           |
|     |     saying I/O PROFILE SUCCESSFULLY STARTED.                           |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  5. On the SELECTION line, enter =5.1 and press ENTER. You             |
|     |     will then see a PROFILE STATUS/SELECTION menu, and the top         |
|     |     line should show the request you just made, with PENDING           |
|     |     in the STATUS COLUMN. This means TMONMVS is monitoring the         |
|     |     DASD volume, which takes a little time. Every few seconds,         |
|     |     press ENTER, until the STATUS changes to COMPLETE.                 |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  6. Move the cursor to the SEG field at the left side of the           |
|     |     COMPLETE report line and press ENTER. This will bring up           |
|     |     the DASD I/O PROFILE screen.                                       |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  7. Press PF6 to get the DASD DATA SET I/O ACTIVITY PROFILE            |
|     |     screen. This shows the datasets being used on the volume,          |
|     |     and the jobs using them. This can be very helpful in               |
|     |     analyzing DASD I/O problems.                                       |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                 Tracing Wild Branches Using SLIP and GTF               |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  1. Build an SBT SLIP trap to trace all branches to a                  |
|     |     particular location. An example, which would show all              |
|     |     branches to offset +AC in a module named DXT0230U in the           |
|     |     private area running under the jobname RUX1077W and                |
|     |     writing trace records containing standard data (STD) and           |
|     |     registers (REGS) would be:                                         |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |          SLIP SET,SBT,A=TRACE,TRDATA=(STD,REGS),J=RUX1077W,            |
|     |               PVTMOD=(DXT0230U,AC,AC),ID=RNT1,END                      |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  2. If a dump is desired in addition, use A+TRDUMP and add the         |
|     |     dump condition (such as C=0C4). A range of offsets may be          |
|     |     traced. To trace all references between +86 and +148, use          |
|     |     PVTMOD=(DXT0230U,86,148).                                          |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  3. When the SLIP trap is entered, a message will indicate it          |
|     |     is active, but that GTF is not active.                             |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  4. Start GTF and specify:                                             |
|     |          TRACE=SLIP,JOBNAMEP                                           |
|     |          JOBNAME=RUX1077W                                              |
|     |          END                                                           |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  5. On completion, stop the GTF run (and the SLIP trap, if             |
|     |     necessary). The SLIP trap will notify you the first time           |
|     |     there is a hit, but not after that.                                |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  6. Using IPCS, point to the GTF trace dataset and on the              |
|     |     COMMAND screen (4) enter GTF. Say yes when asked if the            |
|     |     dataset contains only trace data.                                  |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |  7. The standard SLIP trace records (S+U) contain the branch           |
|     |     information as follows:                                            |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |        IADR: The address of the branch instruction to                  |
|     |              DXT0230U+AC                                               |
|     |        INS:  The branch instruction itself, in hex.                    |
|     |        OPSW: The PSW, as updated by the branch instruction.            |
|     |              The PSW address should therefore be the address           |
|     |              of the instruction being traced.                          |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |

_______________________________________________________________________________
|     |08/30/1999           TSO TRANSMIT(XMIT) COMMAND                 TRANSMIT|
|     |                                                                        |
|     |The TRANSMIT command can be used to unload a PDS to a flat file which   |
|     |can then be sent to the the PC hard drive using Reflection/IND$FILE.    |
|     |The TSO RECEIVE command can be used to rebuild the PDS from this flat   |
|     |file. This makes it possible to send load modules to another mainframe  |
|     |site.                                                                   |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Simply copying a load module will not work, as the directory entry at   |
|     |receiving site contains none of the information needed by Program Fetch.|
|     |An IEBCOPY unload cannot be used with Reflections, either, since this   |
|     |creates a RECFM=VS flat file that Reflections/IND$FILE cannot handle.   |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |The XMIT command requires, as its first parameter, an address that is   |
|     |given as nodename.userid. To find the nodename, get in SDSF and use     |
|     |the NODE command. In the list, look for OWNNODE in the status column,   |
|     |and use the value in the nodename column for that row. Nodename BCV was |
|     |valid when this was written. An example TRANSMIT command to unload a PDS|
|     |named TEST.LOADLIB to a flat file called BC0THOR.UNLOAD would be:       |
|     |XMIT BCV.BC0THOR DSNAME('TEST.LOADLIB') PDS OUTDSNAME('BC0THOR.UNLOAD') |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Output from the XMIT command is DSORG=PS,RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120 |
|     |which is acceptable to Reflection/IND$FILE. To transfer this flat file  |
|     |from the mainframe to the PC using Reflection/IND$FILE, first get to a  |
|     |TSO READY prompt outside of ISPF, then select the SETUP menu item in    |
|     |Reflection and set Active Protocol: IND$FILE, Host System: TSO, Max     |
|     |size: Disabled, then choose Advanced. Enter blanks in Logical Record    |
|     |Length and Block Size and uncheck both boxes under CR/LF processing.    |
|     |Set Space allocation units to default. Enter OK until back to the       |
|     |Reflection screen, then choose File from the menu and Transfer from the |
|     |drop-down list. In the Local file names window (top left) type the name |
|     |of the PC file to be created (for example, C:\UNLD) and in the TSO Host |
|     |Name(member) window (top right) type the name of the mainframe file you |
|     |created using the XMIT command. Enter the fully qualified name enclosed |
|     |in apostrophes (for example: 'BC0THOR.UNLOAD') and in the center of     |
|     |the screen set Transfer Method: Binary, IF File Exists: overwrite, and  |
|     |Record Format: fixed. Finally, select the top center transfer box with  |
|     |arrows pointing left to initiate the transfer.                          |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Once the PC file is created, you can attach it to an email to send it   |
|     |to the receiving mainframe site. At the other end, the attached file    |
|     |must be saved to the PC hard drive, then transferred to their mainframe |
|     |using the same Reflection/IND$FILE settings above. Finally, they must   |
|     |use the TSO RECEIVE command to recreate the load library. First issue   |
|     |the TSO command: PROFILE PROMPT, since this must be in effect for the   |
|     |RECEIVE command to work. A sample RECEIVE command to restore the flat   |
|     |file BC0THOR.RCVD is:                                                   |
|     |     RECEIVE INDSNAME('BC0THOR.RCVD')                                   |
|     |If successful, you are asked to reply with parameters, which means you  |
|     |enter the dsname to be used for the reload. This PDS will be created    |
|     |if it does not exist. To restore the file with name BC0THOR.RELOADED,   |
|     |you would enter:                                                        |
|     |     DSNAME('BC0THOR.RELOADED')                                         |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |Procedure to fix this:                                                  |
|     | 1. On SYSA or SYSB (wherever SMPE04 can be seen) use TMONMVS to get the|
|     |    device id:                                                          |
|     |    A. Issue command DEVUSER.                                           |
|     |    B. Tab to the VOLSER field and type SMPE04, then (enter).           |
|     |    C. The UNIT field should now contain a 4-digit (hex) unit number.   |
|     | 2. On the same system, use SYSCON or SDSF to enter the command         |
|     |    D M=DEV(xxxx) where xxxx is the unit number from step 1.C. In the   |
|     |    resulting display, choose any CHP that has Y's under it. This will  |
|     |    be a 2-digit (hex) number.                                          |
|     | 3. On the original system with the outstanding reply, use SYSCON or    |
|     |    SDSF to enter the commands (omit the M/ prefix in SYSCON):          |
|     |        M/CF CHP(xx),ONLINE        where xx is the CHP from step 2.     |
|     |        M/VARY xxxx,ONLINE         where xxxx is unit from step 1.C.    |
|     |        /R nn,xxxx                 where xxxx is unit from step 1.C.    |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |libraries and invoke XPEDITER and including the INSTALL parameter. For  |
|     |example, TSO XPED INSTALL in the case of V6R6M0. The CLIST is in        |
|     |SYS1.CLIST.                                                             |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |When compiling under the XPEDITER PREPARE option, include APOST, CSYN,  |
|     |and LANGLVL(2) for the IVP programs. Add SPP.XPEDTSO.V6R6M0.SAMPLIB to  |
|     |the SYSLIB panel. In the link, add MAP and XREF and either CALL or NCAL |
|     |to the PARMS. Add the load library containing the TRITST and TRIRPT     |
|     |programs when doing TRIMAIN. Also include either SYS1.COB2LIB or        |
|     |CEE.SCEELKED as appropriate. For the IMS TRIMPP program, add the library|
|     |containing CBLTDLI to the SYSLIB and enter ENTRY DLITCBL in the SYSIN.  |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |When testing TRIMPP, add the library containing program ADSIM001 to the |
|     |LOADLIB panel: SPP.XPEDTSO.V6R6M0.LOADLIB.                              |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |IMS commands useful when testing the TRIMPP program/transaction:        |
|     |/DIS A     Shows active users. After setting up in XPEDITER/TSO, your   |
|     |           userid will show with class 31 if all went well.             |
|     |/DIS DB XPIMSDB Shows status of the XPIMSDB database. It should not be  |
|     |           stopped. If it is, use the STA command to start it.          |
|     |/DIS PGM ADSIM001 Shows status of the ADSIM001 program. Start it if it  |
|     |           is stopped.                                                  |
|     |/DIS TRAN XPEDTX1 Shows status of the XPEDTX1 transaction. Start it if  |
|     |           is stopped.                                                  |
|     |/END followed by /RCL terminates the IMS session when finished.         |
|     |/TEST MFS  Should precede the initiating command /FOR TRIMPP so that    |
|     |           the format is obtained from the test libraries.              |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Password updates are implemented by first importing the dataset received|
|     |from Compuware using the CWLMA CLIST, then execute the CLFINIT CLIST    |
|     |to update the password file. If initial screen asks for the license file|
|     |name, get it from SYS1.PROCLIB(CLFINIT)                                 |
|     |                                                                        |

|     |12/09/1999         XPEDITER TESTING IN SORT EXITS               XPEDSRT1|
|     |                                                                        |
|     |When testing a sort exit using XPEDITER, the batch execution method is  |
|     |used, where JCL is submitted to batch via XPEDITER panel 4.1, and the   |
|     |test begins when the exit routine is entered.                           |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |1. Assemble the sort exit for XPEDITER so that a DDIO file is created.  |
|     |   Note the dsnames for the DDIO file and the load library, as they will|
|     |   be needed below.                                                     |
|     |2. Build the sort control statements to be used. They will be a modified|
|     |   version of normal sort control statements, but modified so that      |
|     |   XTASKLIB is specified for the library containing the exit to be      |
|     |   tested. For example: MODS E15=(MYEXIT,15000,XTASKLIB,N). Other       |
|     |   control statements require no changes.                               |
|     |3. Build the execution JCL, which will be a modified version of the     |
|     |   normal JCL:                                                          |
|     |   A. Change the EXEC statement so that it contains at least:           |
|     |      EXEC PGM=XPDSORT,PARM='CORE=MAX,NOSTAE,NOSTIMER,VSIO=NONE'        |
|     |   B. Add an XTASKLIB DD statement pointing to the load library that    |
|     |      contains the exit to be tested.                                   |
|     |   C. Modify the SYSIN DD statement to point to the modified control    |
|     |      statements created in step 2.                                     |
|     |4. Create an XPEDITER script member in a PDS having RECFM=FB,LRECL=80   |
|     |   that contains the following:                                         |
|     |      SET DYNAMIC xxxxxxxx                                              |
|     |      BEFORE xxxxxxxx.                                                  |
|     |      AFTER xxxxxxxx.                                                   |
|     |   In these statements, xxxxxxxx is the member name of the sort exit to |
|     |   be tested in the XTASKLIB file. Be sure to include the periods in the|
|     |   BEFORE and AFTER statements. If the exit routine's member name is not|
|     |   the same as its CSECT name, use an INTERCEPT statement rather than   |
|     |   the 3 statements above. An example is:                               |
|     |       INTercept sort-exit LOAdm load-mod-name                          |
|     |   Also, if any assembly module does VCON modifications, use a          |
|     |       SET EXCLUDE xxxxxxxx.                                            |
|     |   where xxxxxxxx is the module name.                                   |
|     |5. In a WORKBEMCH ISPF session, use =2.3.XP to enter XPEDITER panels,   |
|     |   choose option 3 - BATCH to get the PROCESS EXECUTE JCL screen and    |
|     |   type SE on the command line and press Enter to get the SETUP MENU.   |
|     |   Enter to get to the TEST SETUP MENU.                                 |
|     |   A. Choose 1 - LOADLIBS to get to the BASE PRODUCT DATASETS screen    |
|     |      and enter:                                                        |
|     |      (1) ===> 'SPP.XPEDTSO.TEST.LOADLIB'                               |
|     |      (2) ===> 'SYS1.LINKLIB'                                           |
|     |      (3) ===> 'library containing the exit to be tested'               |
|     |      Press Enter to return to the SETUP MENU.                          |
|     |   B. Choose 2 - DDIO to get to the DDIO FILES panel and enter the name |
|     |      of the DDIO file in (1).                                          |
|     |      Press Enter to return to the SETUP MENU.                          |
|     |   C. Choose 3 - INCLUDES to get the TEST SCRIPT LIBRARIES panel and    |
|     |      in (1) enter the name of the script library used in step 4.       |
|     |      Press Enter to return to the SETUP MENU.                          |
|     |   D. Press PF3 to get back to the PROCESS EXECUTE JCL screen where     |
|     |      you will enter the dsname and member name for the sort JCL that   |
|     |      was created in step 2 and press Enter to Enter.                   |

|     |  D. The SELECT JOB STEP should be displayed now.                       |
|     |     (1) Type RUN on the command line.                                  |
|     |     (2) Move the cursor to the red underscore at the left of the line  |
|     |         showing the step that will be tested. Type the letter I over   |
|     |         red underscore, then tab to the INITSCR column.                |
|     |     (3) Type the member name of the script created in step4 in the     |
|     |         INITSCR column.                                                |
|     |     (4) Press Enter to submit the job and begin the test. Several      |
|     |         informative messages will be given, such as: JOB IS EXECUTING, |
|     |         JOB IS NOT READY TO CONNECT, WAITING FOR CONNECTION TO VTAM,   |
|     |         etc. Wait until the XPEDITER SOURCE screen appears, then begin |
|     |         testing. If message NO DDIO DATASET FOUND FOR XPDSORT ...      |
|     |         appears, press PF12 and wait.                                  |
|     |7. To begin testing, press PF9 to begin single stepping through the code|
|     |   or set breakpoints at desired places and press PF12 to run to the    |
|     |   next breakpoint. The GPREGS command will cause regsiter contents     |
|     |   to be diaplayed. Peek, Display, DP, and Keep commands can be used to |
|     |   display and modify data. The V line command can be used to display   |
|     |   and modify instructions.                                             |
|     |8. If the test session is terminated while the sort is still active, try|
|     |   not to use the EXIT or QUIT commands, as they can cause a S0C4 abend |
|     |   and may reduce your region size thereafter. Instead, use the Primary |
|     |   Commands:                                                            |
|     |     MOVE 16 TO SORT-RETURN.                                            |
|     |     GO 1    (PF9)                                                      |
|     |     GOTO nnnnn (nnnn is the RELEASE or RETURN statement number)        |
|     |     GO 1    (PF9 repeatedly until at the statement following the sort.)|
