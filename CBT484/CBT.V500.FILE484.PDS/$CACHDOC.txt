                      Cacheman (Amdahl Cache Utility)

This document contains a description of the tool Cacheman, a brief
history of the product,  a sample of the ISPF panels and output from
an actual session, and the instructions for installing on a host MVS
system.

Description:  Cacheman is a software tool that allows the user to
display the cacheing status of DASD controllers and devices connected to
cached controllers.  This dialog is much easier to use than the ISMF
panels but is NOT a replacement for ISMF.  The dialog features a user
customizable options panel, logging, and field level help.

Cacheman is an ISPF dialog that formats the output from the LISTDATA and
SETCACHE commands and displays the results in a tabular format.  The
status of devices and controllers can be easily monitored and modified
from these panels.  An options panel allows the user to easily 'tailor'
certain aspects of this dialog.  Help panels and field level help are
both available in this dialog. It will work for 3990, 3880-11,13,21,23,
and 3rd party 3990 compatible controllers (Amdahl, Hitachi, EMC, etc)

Cacheman is coded in TSO/E REXX.  There are three small assembler
routines which scan the UCB chains and return information. No modules
require APF authorization. RACF or ACF/2 authorizations will be required
to allow users to issue the LISTDATA and SETCACHE commands.

The user can select which controllers/dasd will be displayed on the
output panel by either a partial or complete volser name or by an
address range.  The output panel for controllers will display the
controller model, subsystem ID, amount of subsystem storage, amount
available, amount of NVS storage, amount NVS available, subsystem
status, CFW status, NVS status and indicators for offline memory and
pinned tracks. The user can modify the subsystem status field, the SD
Cache status field, and the NVS status field by typing over the
displayed value with a new value.  An '=' in the action field of other
controllers will replicate the same status changes for those controllers

The output panel for dasd devices will display the unit address, volser,
device model, cache status and DFW status, indicators for pinned tracks
and whether this volume is duplexed, and actual statuses for cache, NVS,
and CFW.  The actual status is a combination of device status and
controller status. The user can modify the cache and DFW status fields
by typing over the displayed value.  An '=' in the action field of other
devices will replicate the same status changes for those devices.

The options panel allows users to set flags to:
  View results of all SETCACHE commands in a popup window
  Display a confirmation window prior to executing a SETCACHE command
  Enable/disable command logging
  State which PFKEY to use for refreshing panel status.
In addition each user can identify which characters to use for the
valid actions on the controller and device panels.  If color terminals
are being used the color of certain fields may be specified on this
panel. The option settings will be saved in the users profile.


History:

Cacheman is a result of Product Certifications need for a method to
monitor and control Cache status of controllers and devices that was
more user friendly than using the ISMF panels and more productive
than using native TSO LISTDATA and SETCACHE commands.  The tool was
developed during the certification of the R49 microcode for 6100 dasd
controllers by Chuck Baumann (SPA) in his spare time. Since it was
made available to Amdahl customers it has been downloaded by over
200 different individuals worldwide.

Version 1.0 was the original prototype used by Cert.

Version 1.1 included better error handling and integrated suggestions
received from Product Certification. It was made available to the field
via AMTAG in February 1994.

Version 1.2 corrected some minor problems for displaying values received
from 3880 controllers and added the device model number as a new field
on the device panel.  It was made available via AMTAG in June 1994.

Version 1.2a corrected problems with the duplex logic and problems with
3880 device reporting. It was made available on AMTAG in July 1994.

Version 1.3  improved the error handling, changed the method used to
report pinned tracks, and moved the model lookup table from the assembler
module to the exec to allow users to add devices with new capacities.
It was made available via AMTAG in September 1994.

Version 2.0  now adds the capability to monitor cache performance in
foreground or background without the need of Cache RMF Reporter.  It
displays information in a format similar to the reports from the IBM
program product Cache RMF Reporter.
It was made available via AMTAG in November  1994.

Version 2.1 and 2.2 corrected problems with REXX interpreting certain
strings as exponential notation rather than hex strings and a few other
coding problems.  The DEVTYPE module was also changed to return certain
error information to the Cachemn1 exec.
It was made available via AMTAG in January  1995.

Version 2.3 extends the Hits option to the device level.  A SMF exit is
now supplied with Cacheman. It is IEFU84 which will write WTO messages
to the console and syslog describing the 3990 state changes as they
occur. This exit is optional and not required by Cacheman.
Cacheman now has a command which will display a grid of all controllers
and devices with their current caching status for a quick overall view.
Cacheman now logs information about calls to DEVTYPE.

Version 2.4 adds the SORT command to reorder screens using different
fields as the sort key.  It also changes the method used for
determining device models.  It will now disable logging if the log
data fills up (B37 abend) to avoid error messages coming to the users
terminal.

(The following panels are ONLY a subset of all the panels in this
 application.  They are the most commonly used panels.)

           Amdahl Cache Utility Install Instructions

To complete the installation of the Amdahl Cache Utility please complete
the following steps:

1. Copy all execs from hlq.EXEC to a library in the SYSPROC or SYSEXEC
   concatenation of the TSO Logon proc.
   or
   Add the dataset hlq.EXEC to the SYSPROC or SYSEXEC concatenation of
   the TSO Logon proc.  Note that the dataset with the largest blksize
   should come first in the concatenation.

   The execs make use of the ISPF LIBDEF facility so the other datasets
   will be dynamically allocated.

2. You MUST edit hlq.EXEC(CACHEMN0) and change the dataset names in the
   LIBDEF statements to reflect the new dataset names.
   You MUST also edit hlq.ISPSLIB(CSHSKEL2) and change the dataset name
   in the STEPLIB DD and the SYSEXEC DD to reflect your dataset names.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE     Enough!-----
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If your version of ISPF is less than version 3.3 remove the following   s
two lines from hlq.ISPPLIB(CSHMAN1):

 IF (&ZTDSELS ¬= 0)
   VER(&ACT,LISTV,&VERCTL,MSG=CSHM009)

and remove the following two lines from hlq.ISPPLIB(CSHMAN3):

 IF (&ZTDSELS ¬= 0)
   VER(&LOP,LISTV,&VERDEV,MSG=CSHM000)

(the LISTV form of VER was new with version 3.3) This will not change
the function of this dialog.  If an invalid character is entered for
an action on a row it will be ignored and no message will be displayed
indicating use of an invalid operator.

You must also update the member IKJTSOxx in SYS1.PARMLIB to identify
LISTDATA and SETCACHE as authorized commands (AUTHCMD section).


4. This could also be set up as a menu option on the primary menu or on
   some other sub menu. The following shows an example of how to add this
   dialog to a menu panel. For this example I used the panel found in
   ISP.V3R3M0.ISPPENU(ISP@MSTR).

You are now ready to invoke the dialog.
From any command input area enter 'TSO CACHEMAN.
From option 6 panel or from native TSO Ready prompt enter 'CACHEMAN'.
If you added an option to a menu it may be selected by that identifier.
