This  library  contains a complete Dynamic PROCLIB modification.  This
modification is compatible with all versions of MVS/SP 1.3.3 to MVS/SP
3.1.3.  This release of Dynamic PROCLIB includes  substantial  changes
to  the previous release(s) and REQUIRES de-installation of any previ-
ous level installed.

**********************************************************************

This Dynamic PROCLIB Modification  is  copyrighted  by  Amdahl  Corpo-
ration,  even  though  it  is  essentially in the public domain.   The
intent of this copyright was to prevent it's appropriation and  inclu-
sion in a product that is sold.  This code will remain free as long as
Amdahl retains any rights to it.

This  copyright,  however,  has not prevented at least one vendor of a
Dynamic PROCLIB from using MOST of the code contained in IEFVPP as the
basis for their product.  This was done by an ex-Amdahl employee  that
had no involvement whatsoever in the development or enhancement of any
version  of  the  Amdahl Dynamic PROCLIB Modification.  As noted, this
Dynamic PROCLIB Modification originally came from Mutual Life of Cana-
da.

This vendor, who shall remain nameless here, nevertheless is guilty of
poor ethics.  And if people are willing to pay a substantial amount of
money for something that's available in the  public  domain,  well,  I
guess that there's a sucker born every minute.
