This  library  contains a complete Dynamic PROCLIB modification.  This
modification is compatible with all versions of MVS/SP 1.3.3 to MVS/SP
3.1.3.  This release of Dynamic PROCLIB includes  substantial  changes
to  the previous release(s) and REQUIRES de-installation of any previ-
ous level installed.

**********************************************************************

Four complete versions of the SMP format modifications  are  provided.
One  is  for  MVS/SP  1.3.x (#ZSP13x members), one is for MVS/SP 2.1.x
(#ZSP21x members), one is for MVS/SP 2.2.0 (#ZSP22x members), and  the
fourth is for MVS/SP 3.1.x (#YSP31x members).

The source code for the additional module (IEFVPP) is fully compatible
with  all  levels  of  MVS/SP.    However,  Assembler  H, Version 2 is
required to reassemble it.  Unless the default setting of the  &SWA220
SET  Symbols  is  changed,  the  MVS/SP 2.2.0 Macro Libraries are also
required to properly assembly IEFVPP.

IEFCVRWA is the Converter Work Area mapping Macro  from  the  MVS  3.8
Optional  Materials.  It is necessary to properly assemble IEFVPP.  It
is currently NOT necessary to obtain a version of this Macro from  the
licensed  Optional  Materials provided with the MVS/SPs, as all refer-
enced data fields are unchanged.   However, this  may  change  in  the
future.

Extensive  documentation  on  the  installation  and  function of this
Dynamic PROCLIB Modification can be found in other members and in  the
Comments in the SMP Modifications and the source for IEFVPP.

Since  1977,  this  modification  has had only one major change (other
than changing the Converter ZAPs) until the changes  made  in  release
3.2.0  (which  were mostly enhancements).  This was to support the SJF
feature added in MVS/SP 1.3.2.  The change was made to  be  compatible
across all levels of MVS and to eliminate the future dependence on the
size  of  the Converter Work Area.  This change took all of ONE DAY to
make.  Hence, this modification can be considered quite stable.    The
changes  in  this  release make this Dynamic PROCLIB Modification even
more MVS Release level independent.

Note:  Please use extreme care when reworking the Superzap against the
Interpreter module (IEFVDA) when maintenance or a new release hits it.
Be sure that the Base/Displacements of the various branches are  prop-
erly calculated and changed.  0C1s and 0C4s in the Interpreter are the
most common symptoms when the Superzap is not properly reworked.
