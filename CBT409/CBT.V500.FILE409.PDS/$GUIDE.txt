Online User Guide
-----------------

The ISPF interface to MXI functions in a similar fashion to SDSF.

Any of the available commands presented on the MXI Primary Option Menu
can be entered on the command line on any MXI screen.

MXI saves the previous screen in storage and will re-display it when
you press PF3 to exit the current screen.

Some MXI commands can take an extra parameter to filter the information
that is displayed. In most cases the parameter can use the '*' wildcard
and '%' placeholder characters. For example, to show ONLY the SYS1
datasets in the MVS Linklist enter the MXI command 'LINK SYS1.*'. Check
the online help for an explanation of any parameters that your desired
command will accept.

Some fields on the MXI screens are 'point-and-shoot'. By default these
fields are underlined. When you place the cursor on a point-and-shoot
field and press enter, MXI will take you to the most appropriate
screen for that field.

Please review the online help for the following MXI control commands:
o SET DSCB
o SET JOB
o SET MAJ
o SET SYS
o FIND, IFIND and RESET
o PRT
o SET SCREEN
o SORT
o SRCH

Batch User Guide
----------------
MXI can also be run as a batch job. The MXI commands are entered via the
SYSIN DDname and the resultant output is written to the SYSPRINT DDname.
Multiple commands can be specified and they will be processed in
sequential order.

The MXI program must be invoked with the parameter 'BATCH' but can also
have the optional extra parameter 'NOTITLES' to suppress the screen
titles.

Example JCL :

//MXIBATCH  EXEC PGM=MXI,PARM='BATCH,NOTITLES'
//SYSPRINT  DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN     DD   *
  LINK
  LPA
/*

//MXIBATCH  EXEC PGM=MXI,PARM='BATCH'
//SYSPRINT  DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN     DD   *
  SET DSCB ON
  APF
  SVC
  SSI
  DA * ONLY(STC)
/*

REXX Interface
--------------
MXI also has a REXX function interface. One or more MXI commands can be passed
to the REXX function and the result of the commands are placed sequentially in
the specified REXX stem.

Syntax

    rcode = MXIREXX(stemname,cmd1,cmd2,....,cmdn)

Keywords
    RCODE    Return code from the MXIREXX function

    STEMNAME The name of the stem variable to hold the result of the
             commands. This must be enclosed in quotes. The maximum
             length of the stem name is 24 characters including the
             fullstop at the end of the name.

    CMDn     The MXI command(s) executed. These must be enclosed in
             quotes and separated by commas.
             The maximum support length of a single command is 72
             bytes.

             NOTE : If you wish to suppress the titles and columns you
                    can specify a special value of 'NOTITLES' as the
                    first command passed to MXIREXX.


Example

rcode = MXIREXX('line.','SET DSCB ON','LPA',LINK SYS1.*')
i = 1
do line.0
  say line.i
  i = i + 1
  end
exit
