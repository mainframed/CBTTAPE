)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Displays the current XCF structures
+
!Command Syntax
+ @XCFS str-mask+
+
!Keywords      +
  @str-mask    +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the XCF structure name.
               +The wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
               +can be used. The default value of str-mask is '*'.
+
!Example
+ @XCFS IXC* +  List all XCF structures starting 'IXC'
+
!Considerations
  +The@XCFS+command requires MXI to be running in authorized mode. For further
  +information on running MXI authorized, see the@MISC+section of this Help
  +dialog.
+
