!Function
+  Displays the current system exceptions.

!Command Syntax
+ @EXC XPT(xx)
+
!Keywords      +
  @XPT(xx)       +An optional exception table suffix 'xx'. This two character
                 +value is appended to 'MXIXPT' to form the name of the table
                 +that is to be used. The table is held a a load module and is
                 +loaded either from the MXIXPT DDname or from JOBLIB, STEPLIB
                 +or MVS linklist.
                 +If this keyword is omitted, the default value of XPT(00) is
                 +used unless it has been previously overwritten by the@SET XPT
                 +command.
+
+The exceptions are displayed under four main sections.
+
!System Wide Exceptions
  +These exceptions can include the following :
   o +System CPU percentage busy
   o +UIC value
   o +Number of free ASVT slots
   o +CSA, SQA, E-CSA and E-SQA percentage used
   o +Amount of CSA and E-CSA converted to SQA and E-SQA
   o +The number of online CPUs
+
!Enqueue Conflicts and RESERVEs
  +Any RESERVEs and enqueue conflicts are ALWAYS shown regardless of
   the success of loading the MXIXPTxx exceptions table.
+
!DASD Volume Exceptions
  +These exceptions ALWAYS include listing any DASD devices that are
  +pending offline and can also include exceptions for DASD volumes that
  +should or should not be online.
+
!Address Space Exceptions
  +These exceptions can include the following :
   o +Address space CPU percentage busy
   o +Real and expanded storage frames in use
   o +Working set size
   o +Non-VIO auxiliary storage slots
   o +CSA, SQA , E-CSA and E-SQA usage
   o +Number of minutes that the address space has been waiting
