//*     The MVSDSSN is an extension of the standard ADRDSSU         *   FILE 880
//*     utility, to manage the dumps in the network.  We have       *   FILE 880
//*     here (ISIS Information System) two very old tape units,     *   FILE 880
//*     but "nearly" unlimited storage capacity on the local        *   FILE 880
//*     network.  We extended the ADRDSSU utility via UIM (User     *   FILE 880
//*     Interaction Module) exits to write dumps to HFS             *   FILE 880
//*     (Hierarchical File System) files, and store the dump        *   FILE 880
//*     information in a DB2 database.  This modification is        *   FILE 880
//*     running here for several years, maybe smaller shops can     *   FILE 880
//*     use this.  A large part of the modification was written     *   FILE 880
//*     in C/C++, we provide the complete source code, and the      *   FILE 880
//*     necessary definitions for DB2.  The code uses the open      *   FILE 880
//*     source "zlib" general purpose compress library,             *   FILE 880
