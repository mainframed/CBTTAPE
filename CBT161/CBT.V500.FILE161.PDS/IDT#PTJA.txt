%         Implementation of TSO/E  TRANSMIT-RECEIVE
+
+       TSO/E has a tool called Interactive Data Transmission Facility
+   (IDTF) from IBM. IDTF allows you to transmit data between nodes in
+   a network.  Computers are linked together with IBM's Network  Job
+   Entry (NJE) system. This link is made by having bisynchronous (BSC)
+   or Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) lines linking each system.
+   This linking could be pictured as following:
+
+                SDLC             SLDC            SLDC
+     *-------*   or   *-------*   or  *-------*   or   *-------*
+     |       |  BSC   |       |  BSC  |       |  BSC   |       |
+     |  MVS  |--------|  VM1  |-------|  MVS  |--------|  VSE  |
+     |       |  line  |       |  line |       |  line  |       |
+     *-------*        *-------*       *-------*        *-------*
