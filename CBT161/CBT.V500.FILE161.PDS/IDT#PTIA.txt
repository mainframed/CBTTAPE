%         Implementation of TSO/E  TRANSMIT-RECEIVE
+
+       TSO/E has a tool called Interactive Data Transmission Facility
+   (IDTF) from IBM. IDTF allows you to transmit data between nodes in
+   a network.  Computers can also be running in on the same hardware
+   platform using different Logical Partitions or LPARs.  Systems are
+   linked together with IBM's Network Job Entry (NJE) system.  This
+   This link is made by having Channel-to-Channel Adapters (CTCA) or
+   Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) lines linking each system.
+   This linking could be pictured as following:
+
+                SDLC             SLDC            SLDC
+     *-------*   or   *-------*   or  *-------*   or   *-------*
+     |       |  CTCA  |       |  CTCA |       |  CTCA  |       |
+     |  MVS1 |--------|  MVSA |-------|  MVS2 |--------| MVSB  |
+     |       |  line  |       |  line |       |  line  |       |
+     *-------*        *-------*       *-------*        *-------*
