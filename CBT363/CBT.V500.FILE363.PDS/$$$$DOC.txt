This is a thread on the ISPF-L newsgroup, concerning the coding
of a Data Set Name Change Exit, to dynamically change the name of
the ISPF Recovery Data Sets.

Included is a coded exit from Stephen Bacher of the Draper Labs
at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The entire thread of
discussion is included as MSG001 thru MSG008.

This exit (as coded) is invoked under PIE (a vendor product which
allows the running of multiple TSO sessions under ONE address
space).  Since there are (potentially) multiple ISPF sessions which
can generate Recovery Data Set names that are identical, we need
this exit to make the dataset names unique, by appending the session
id of the particular PIE session to the dataset name.

However, there is much flexibility in this exit routine, as is
documented in the code, and the exit is a good coding example
to follow if you have some related need.
