//***FILE 768 is from Rick Bourgeois, and contains an adaptation    *   FILE 768
//*           of the "real tape to AWS tape" and vice-versa         *   FILE 768
//*           facilities, from File 533, to run under CMS.  The     *   FILE 768
//*           following is a description of this package.  The      *   FILE 768

//*           convert real tape to FLEX-ES (R) Faketape, and        *   FILE 768

//*     The changes to Sam's code that allow his programs to        *   FILE 768
//*     run under CMS or MVS were done using conditional assembly   *   FILE 768
//*     code.  A VTTEQUAT copy file was created and contains a      *   FILE 768
//*     &RUNSYS variable that is used to identify the target        *   FILE 768
//*     system.  The &RUNSYS variable can be coded as 'O/S' or      *   FILE 768
//*     'CMS' and the copy file must be in the maclib used for      *   FILE 768
//*     the assemblies.  It specifies 'CMS' in this                 *   FILE 768
//*     distribution so must be changed for MVS assemblies.         *   FILE 768
//*     The VTTEQUAT copy file also contains the register           *   FILE 768
//*     equates, version variable and default chunk size used       *   FILE 768
//*     when creating AWSTAPE or FAKETAPE disk files.               *   FILE 768

//*     The IEBUPDAP exec was used to create append files for       *   FILE 768
//*     each of the different file types.  There is a './ ADD       *   FILE 768
//*     NAME=filename cmsattrb' where cmsattrb are the CMS          *   FILE 768

//*     The IEBUPDEX exec will extract the individual files         *   FILE 768
//*     from the append files and write them to a CMS disk or       *   FILE 768

//*     The VTT2INST exec will erase the VTT2MAC MACLIB and         *   FILE 768
//*     regenerate the maclib with the VTTEQUAT COPY file.  If      *   FILE 768
//*     you want to add additional macros or copy files in the      *   FILE 768
//*     VTT2MAC MACLIB you can add MACLIB ADD statements            *   FILE 768
//*     following the MACLIB GEN in the exec.  The VTT2INST         *   FILE 768
//*     exec executes the VTT2ASM exec for each assemble file       *   FILE 768
//*     on the install disk.  The VTT2ASM EXEC uses the             *   FILE 768
//*     VMFHLASM exec for the assemblies.  If you do not have       *   FILE 768

//*     VTT2ASM exec for the assembler you use.  The VTT2 CNTRL     *   FILE 768
