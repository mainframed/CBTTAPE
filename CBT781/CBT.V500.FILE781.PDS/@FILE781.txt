//***FILE 781 is from John McKown, and is his modification of an    *   FILE 781
//*           IBM-distributed sample program called RACSEQ.  The    *   FILE 781
//*           disclaimer of the IBM sample program allows that it   *   FILE 781
//*           be reproduced here, so that members #IBMDOC,          *   FILE 781
//*           #IBMCODE and @IBMCODE are transcribed here, pretty    *   FILE 781
//*           much verbatim.                                        *   FILE 781

//*     This is a modification of the IBM supplied RACSEQ           *   FILE 781
//*     program.  It has been modified to be able to write its      *   FILE 781
//*     output in XML format.  It has also been extended to write   *   FILE 781
//*     to a specified DDName, DSName, Sysout class, or UNIX        *   FILE 781
//*     Path.  When writing to a DSName, it can either be an        *   FILE 781
//*     existing DSName, or a new one.  If it is a new one, the     *   FILE 781
//*     DSName will be allocated with either the system defaults,   *   FILE 781
//*     the SMS defaults as assigned by the ACS routines, or with   *   FILE 781
//*     the characteristics specified via a USING() and/or LIKE()   *   FILE 781
//*     parameter.                                                  *   FILE 781
