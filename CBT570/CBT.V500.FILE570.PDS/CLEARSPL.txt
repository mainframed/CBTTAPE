Mr. Golob, I read your column in Technical Support Magazine every
month and I have an MVS tip I would like to share with you.  Perhaps
it is common knowledge, but none of the MVS systems programmers I
showed this to were aware of it.

I'll save you the bloody details, suffice it to say that we ran out
of spool track groups while running our month-end batch stream last
month.  Obviously, that shuts things down pretty quickly.  We
performed the usual CPR to revive the system by deleting some old
jobs from the spool, and managed to limp along until the crisis
passed.  But it bothered me that we didn't seem to have as much room
on the spool as I thought we should.

That is when my MVS systems specialist, Richard Henn pointed
something out to me.  He showed me that if I enter SDSF and type
command 'ST *' I get a list of everything on the queue, some 4,000
entries in our shop.  Page (F8) past the active jobs, about 5 pages
worth, and I found about a screen's worth of jobs that are marked
'HOLD'.

These are jobs that were placed on HOLD at some point in their
execution.  They don't show up anywhere else.  Only the 'ST 'command
shows them.  Worse than that, the '$OQ' command that we use to clean
out our spool on a daily basis does not touch these jobs.

There were several million lines of output associated with these
'HOLD' jobs, and some of them had been in our spool since our last
cold start in 1997.  Deleting these jobs resolved our spool problem.

I recommend that someone from every MVS shop check the spools to see
what might be spinning out there!
