 CBT500   ???????  20yy
09/24/2020 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Add JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.4.
             2) Add IPA updates for z/OS 2.4: RUCSA and BOOST.
             3) Changed the max symbol length in the Symbol display
                from 10 (8 max + ampersand and period) to 18 for
                z/OS 2.2 and above (16 max + ampersand and period).


 CBT499   May 2020
05/06/2020 - Added the SDSFPRT program. This program uses the SDSF
             REXX environment to take all or selected output from
             the spool and copy it to a PDS via SDSF "PRINT"
             commands.


 CBT498   December 2019
08/28/2019 - Updated the SDSF@DR REXX to change the "ST" panel
             invocation from:
             Address SDSF "ISFEXEC ST (DELAYED ALTERNATE)"
               to
             Address SDSF "ISFEXEC ST (DELAYED)"
             in case no alternate panel is defined.  By
             default both primary and alternate fields are
             merged if an alternate exists anyway.
07/01/2019 - Added the DSLISTSV and MEMLSTSV CLIST and REXX EXEC.
06/17/2019 - For z/OS 2.3 and above, added IPA updates for SMFTBUFF,
             OSPROTECT, ICSF and ICSFPROC.
             SMFTBUFF was added via APAR OA52828.
             OSPROTECT was added via APAR OA54807.
             ICSF / ICSFPROC was added via APAR OA55378.
06/17/2019 - Updated the "GET_CPCSI" code in IPLINFO for a larger
             offset into IRALCCT to get the CPC SI info for all
             z/OS 2.3 systems.  The previous change only did it for
             a z14, but the fix is also needed for z13. The problem
             is that I don't know what APAR / PTF makes the larger
             offset required nor if it is processor specific.


 CBT497   April 2019
04/24/2019 - Added the TWOPAK23 job. This is an update to the
             TWOPAK22 job and can be used to create a "rescue"
             system from a z/OS 2.3 driving system.
04/24/2019   Updated the comments in the TWOPAK22 job. Changes
             from TWOPAK21 were accidentally left out of the
             comments section.  I also removed the comments
             that stated the job could be also be used for
             for z/OS 2.3 since there is now a separate sample
             job for z/OS 2.3.
03/06/2019 - Updated the "GET_CPCSI" code in IPLINFO for a larger
             offset into IRALCCT to get the CPC SI info for z/OS 2.3
             at RSU1812 and above running on a z14 (the offset is an
             additional 8 bytes).  I don't know what PTF(s) broke it
             or if there is a similar change for OS versions lower
             than z/OS 2.3.
01/03/2019 - Added a "REVerse" mode to CMD34 to process the data
             set list in reverse order.  "REVerse" mode is useful
             when you are trying to delete GDGs plus the GDG
             base(s) in the data set list, otherwise the command
             will fail against the GDG base since there are still
             GDGs that exist in the base.


 CBT496   November 2018
10/12/2018 - Added the ONEPAK22/TWOPAK22 jobs. These are updates to
             the ONEPAK21/TWOPAK21 jobs and can be used to create a
             "rescue" system from a z/OS 2.2 driving system. They
             should work for z/OS 2.3 also with no changes.

10/12/2018 - Updated the SDSF@DR REXX to check for
             "*BOTTOM OF DATA REACHED*" so it is not displayed as
             an error message from XDC. I'm not sure when IBM added
             this as the code was written in 2009. It may have been
             in z/OS 2.1.


 CBT495   January 2018
12/01/2017 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Add IPA updates for z/OS 2.3: RACF, FXE & IZU.
             2) Add JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.3.
             3) Fix catalog information display in IPL section when
                LOADxx SYSCAT definition is blank / using defaults
                for SYS% to SYS1 conversion (col. 16) and/or alias
                name level (col. 17).
             4) Change RACF version information to match the z/OS
                version instead of the FMID for z/OS 2.2 and above.
                RCVTVRMN always has 7791 starting with z/OS 2.2
                which is not correct.
             5) Add "AUX" undocumented alias for the "PAGE" option.
04/29/2017 - Added RXSMF30 program.  This is a REXX sample to read
             SMF 30 records to produce a job accounting report.


 CBT492   August 2016
10/11/2016 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Add IPA updates for z/OS 2.2: SMFLIM & IEFOPZ.
             2) Add JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.2.
             3) Add some additional SMS information from the SMS
                SSI Vector Table.
             4) Add "EDIt" option that can be specified as the
                3rd parm to edit the output, similar to the
                Nobrowse option. Also changed the check in the
                XLATE_NONDISP subroutine from "> '00'x" to ">=
                '00'x" after seeing a subsystem with x'00' as
                part of the name in the edited output (and the
                ISPF warning about invalid / non-display
                characters).
             5) Add 2G page information to LFAREA display in the
                VMAP section.
             6) Fixed a rounding problem in the "FORMAT_MEMSIZE"
                subroutine for sizes over 1024G that should be
                displayed using "M" instead. The problem was seen
                in the HVSHARE display in the VMAP section.
08/27/2016 - Add 2G page information to LFAREA display in RXSTOR64
             and also added a "NODETAIL" option so only system
             wide totals are displayed for HVSHARE/HVCOMMON/LFAREA.
08/27/2016 - Fixed a rounding problem in the "FORMAT_MEMSIZE"
             subroutine for sizes over 1024G that should be
             displayed using "M" instead in the following EXECs:
             IPLINFO, RXSTOR64, REXXSTOR
08/21/2016 - Added a "Showdups" option to the DELDUPS edit macro
             which will show the duplicate lines instead of deleting
             them.


 CBT491   July 2016
05/15/2016 - Add code to LOGRREXX to remove LS_ALLOCAHEAD(0) if
             system is not z/OS 2.2. The parm is added to lower
             level systems after OA44680 for z/OS 2.2 toleration.
04/04/2016 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Reverted change from 3/12/2015 that changed the
                method of finding the real storage online at IPL for
                z/OS 2.1 and above. IBM opened APAR OA48094 to fix
                the original problem.
             2) Add an undocumented option alias: SSN for SUBsystems.
04/04/2016 - Updated the assembler ASIDLIST and JOBCHECK programs
             to support the ASVT in 31-bit storage which is available
             via DIAGxx CBLOC in z/OS 2.1 and above.


 CBT490   November  2015
05/21/2015 - Change IPLINFO LFAREA display in z/OS 2.1 and above
             to include PAGEABLE1M allocations.  Before the change
             these are incorrectly reported as 4K allocations on
             z/OS 2.1.
05/21/2015 - Change RXSTOR64 LFAREA total display in z/OS 2.1 and
             above to include PAGEABLE1M allocations.  Before the
             change these are incorrectly reported as 4K allocations
             on z/OS 2.1.
05/20/2015 - Fix truncation of "PARESZSL" in the IPLINFO page data
             set display to support the number of slots possibly
             defined on a 3390-54.
05/14/2015 - Add offset change into IRALCCT for CPC SI info as a
             comment in IPLINFO for z/OS 1.13 with z13 maintenance
             applied.
03/12/2015 - IPLINFO updates:
             1) Change method of finding online storage at IPL time
                for z/OS 2.1 and above as CVTRLSTG was not always
                correct. A field from the RIT is used instead.
             2) Add code to show SCM (Storage Class Memory) usage
                to the "PAGE" section similar to "D ASM,SCM"
                output for z/OS 2.1 and above.
01/29/2015 - Updated the REXXMEM memory display utility to work with
             64-bit addresses.  Using 64-bit addresses requires
             z/OS 2.1 or above.


 CBT489   November 2014
10/27/2014 - Added the ONEPAK21/TWOPAK21 jobs. These are updates to
             the ONEPAKZD/TWOPAKZD jobs and can be used to create a
             "rescue" system from a z/OS 2.1 driving system.


 CBT488   June 2014
05/07/2014 - IPLINFO updates for z/OS 2.1:
             1) Updated GET_CPCSI code for larger offset into
                IRALCCT to get the CPC SI info for z/OS 2.1.
             2) Added JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.1.
             3) IPA additions for z/OS 2.1 - 5 IEASYSxx PARMs:
                  PAGESCM, WARNUND, HZS, GTZ and HZSPROC.
05/07/2014 - Updated the REXXMEM help panel.
05/07/2014 - Updated the SMPDELF sample job for deleting
             an SMP/E function.
05/07/2014 - Updated $SNGLTSO doc related to JES3 for z/OS 2.1.
05/01/2014 - Added LFAREA system totals into the VMAP section
             of IPLINFO similar to the "D VS,LFAREA" operator
             display output.
11/22/2013 - Added code to IPLINFO to split the "Supported Subsystem
             Function Codes" display for a given subsystem across
             multiple lines if needed to avoid truncation.
11/13/2013 - Updated REXXMEM to support indirect storage addressing
             similar to IPCS.
11/01/2013 - XEF:  Changed the check in XEFCLIST for a null data set
             name in the data set list to be after the code to
             process the "FIND" option. Version is now 6.4.3


 CBT487   October 2013
10/07/2013 - Added "Help" to the following edit macros:
             COLADD, COLUTIL, DELDUPS, DELNX, DELX, EXCL, FILL,
             INCL, INSLINE, PREFIX, PREFIX2, SUFFIX.
             Also added a check into "FILL" to make sure the fill
             data would fit within the columns specified.
10/07/2013 - Updated the "FIND_LABELS" routine in the following
             edit macros to a better / simpler version:
             COLADD, COLUTIL, FILL, INSLINE, PREFIX, PREFIX2, SUFFIX
10/01/2013 - Updated the DELDUPS edit macro to allow labels to be
             used to limit the range of the operation.
08/23/2013 - Added code to IPLINFO to display the ACF2 data set
             names currently in use plus removed equal sign from
             "CLPA=" and "CVIO=" in the IPA display.  These parms
             have no value when specified in IEASYSxx.  Also
             changed the code that checks for CLPA used at IPL
             time to look at a specific BIT in ASMFLAG2.


 CBT486   April 2013
01/17/2013 - XEF Changes - version is now 6.4.2:
             1) Blank out the saved "F" in the option field if any
                data sets are found that match the search string.
             2) Change XEFMENU panel so the command field is now
                the "Other DSN" field instead of the option field
                so options that conflict with scrolling remain
                in the option field while scrolling the list of
                data sets (M, D, & P). Also added code to the panel
                to allow the full option name to be used instead of
                a single character.  For example: "EDIT" instead of
                "E", "BROWSE" instead of "B" etc.
01/17/2013 - Added additional comments in the source code of IPLHIST
             that describe how to use it.


 CBT485   December 2012

10/22/2012 - Changed the method IPLINFO uses to get the RACF primary
             data set name and also display the backup data set and
             multiple (split) data sets if they exist.


 CBT484   July 2012

07/05/2012 - Added the ONEPAKZD/TWOPAKZD jobs. These are updates to
             the ONEPAKZ8/TWOPAKZ8 jobs and can be used to create a
             "rescue" system from a z/OS 1.12 or z/OS 1.13 driving
             system. ONEPAKZ8/TWOPAKZ8 were also updated with some
             changes to the comments.
06/18/2012 - XEF Changes - version is now 6.4.1:
             1) Force "DSLIST" option when a data set
                is chosen from the menu that contains a pattern.
             2) Added delete member confirmation for the XEF member
                list and also honor the CONFIRM setting.
06/18/2012 - Added delete member confirmation for XMEMLIST and also
             honor the CONFIRM setting.
06/18/2012 - Added new "LINETBL" table sample for supporting ISPF
             line macros natively in z/OS 1.13 (ISPF 6.3) and above.
04/10/2012 - Updated the ISPF Considerations section of the $SNGLTSO
             doc member related to ISPF profile sharing and z/OSMF.
03/19/2012 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Added JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 1.12
                and z/OS 1.13.
             2) Added new parms to the IPA display: AUTOR for
                z/OS 1.12 and above and CATALOG / IXGCNF for
                z/OS 1.13 and above.
             3) Remove RTLS from the IPA display for z/OS 1.13
                and above.
02/13/2012 - Changed description of SVCESRMX in IPLINFO SVC display
             of ESRs from "Max Entries" to "Max ESR Num Supported".
01/03/2012 - Added an "SVC" option / display to IPLINFO and made the
             help panel scrollable. Also added the IPL TOD (GMT) from
             from the IPA to the IPA section.


 CBT483   December 2011

08/19/2011 - Added LSQA usage to REXXSTOR and changed the way
             "Region Available" is calculated.  The new method is
             a better estimation and considers LSQA usage.
08/04/2011 - Fixed 2 errors in IPLINFO identified by the REXX
             compiler and add a few undocumented option aliases:
             SSI / SUBsystems for SUB and MEMory for STOrage.
06/27/2011 - Added a FIND option to XEF.  The XEF version has been
             changed from 6.3 to 6.4.


 CBT482  June 2011

06/06/2011 - Enhanced RXSTOR64 to show LFAREA breakout for 1M and 4K
             page usage in the totals similar to the "D VS,LFAREA"
             command on z/OS 1.12 or z/OS 1.10 and z/OS 1.11 with
             APAR OA31116 appled.
04/15/2011 - Fixed display for HMC LPAR ID to support 2 character
             hex numbers (LPAR ID > x'F') in IPLINFO.
04/04/2011 - Updated IPLINFO to show the GRS mode (NONE/RING/STAR).
03/04/2011 - Updated the following execs to reference my new web
             site URL: APFVER, CATSRCH, FINDMOD, IPLINFO, LPROG,
             REXXMEM, and RXSTOR64.


 CBT479  August 2010

07/19/2010 - Added an option to IPLINFO to change the delimiter
             between returned variables from a blank to "user
             defined" when IPLINFO is called as a REXX function.
             Also added z/OS 1.11 JES2 node table offset & JES3 FMID.
04/06/2010 - Added the IPLHIST and LASTIPL REXX execs.
03/29/2010 - Added the SDSF@DR program. See source code for details.
03/04/2010 - Added comments to ONEPAKZ8 and TWOPAKZ8 that detail
             the changes needed to build a z/OS 1.11 system.
02/01/2010 - Added "ZZ" (zAAP on zIIP) display to the IPA section
             of IPLINFO for z/OS 1.10 and above.
01/06/2010 - Fixed large memory object usage displays in RXSTOR64
             for ASID level displays and the total display. The
             calculations were treating the control block values
             as 4K pages and converting them to megabytes when
             they were already in megabytes by definition.


 CBT478  December 2009

12/22/2009 - Updated LOGRREXX to ignore HLQ(NO_HLQ) when creating
             define cards. EHLQ(NO_EHLQ) was already being ignored.
09/02/2009 - Added comments to ONEPAKZ8 and TWOPAKZ8 that detail
             the changes needed to build a z/OS 1.10 system.
08/20/2009 - Changes to TAPESTAK. See comments in source code.
08/14/2009 - Added FVE REXX exec - Fast View/Edit of data sets.
             This REXX exec is intended to work with ISPF command
             table entries to create "shortcuts" for VIEWing or
             EDITing data sets or data set concatenations. There are
             already examples of adding the command table entries
             dynamically in the ISPCMDSA CLIST. See the source for
             full details.
08/14/2009 - Changed the column indicator line in the IPLINFO
             IPA display from a length of 70 to 72.
06/08/2009 - Updated RXSTOR64 to display ASID level large memory
             objects for z/OS 1.9 and above (with supporting
             hardware) and ASID level 64-bit common storage usage
             for z/OS 1.10 and above. Also added system wide usage
             summaries for 64-bit shared virtual (HVSHARE), 64-bit
             large memory objects (large / 1M page support) and
             64-bit common storage (HVCOMMON) at the appropriate
             software levels.
05/29/2009 - IPLINFO updates:
             1) Use GDATotalCSAHWM & GDATotalECSAHWM instead of
                GDACSAHWM & GDAECSAHWM for CSA/ECSA HWM in VMAP
                section for z/OS 1.10 and above.
