 EDIT Macros:
   Copy the macro to any library in the SYSPROC concatenation.
   If the macro is a REXX, it can also be placed in any library
   in the SYSEXEC concatenation.

   The LINETBL sample is in TSO XMIT format.  You must use the
   TSO RECEIVE command to obtain a usable file. For example:

        TSO RECEIVE INDA('userid.cbt.file434(LINETBL)')
           (you will be prompted to enter a data set name:)
        DA('userid.EDMAC.LINETBL')

 REXX EXECs/CLISTs:
   Copy the EXEC or CLIST to any library in the SYSPROC concatenation.
   REXX programs can also be placed in any library in the SYSEXEC
   concatenation.

   Many of the REXX EXECs and CLISTS are best used when set up as ISPF
   commands. The ISPCMDSA CLIST is an example of how to add these
   commands on a temporary basis without actually modifying the ISPF
   Command Table (ISPCMDS). This also allows you to create aliases or
   command abbbreviations without renaming the CLIST/EXEC.

 eXtended Editor Facility (XEF):
   XEF is an ISPF dialog application that is used for BROWSING,
   VIEWING, EDITING, or COMPRESSING a dataset. It allows you to
   choose a dataset from a menu instead of typing in the entire dataset
   name. XEF can also be used to obtain DATASET INFORMATION or
   display a DATASET MEMBER LIST of a partitioned dataset. From the
   member list you can select members to be BROWSEd, VIEWed, EDITed,
   DELETEd, RENAMEd, or PRINTed.  Using the DSLIST option, a dataset
   pattern can be entered to display a Data Set List that is like ISPF
   option 3.4.  If the CBT PDS command is installed, XEF can also
   interface with it.

   XEF is invoked by selecting the main menu panel - XEFMENU. It can be
   added to an existing ISPF option panel or is best used when set up as a
   command in the ISPF Command Table (ISPCMDS). The ISPCMDSA
   CLIST in this PDS has an example of how to add the XEF command on a
   temporary basis without actually modifying the ISPF Command Table.

 XEF Installation Instructions:

   Add the following CLISTs to a library in the SYSPROC concatenation:
      XEFCLIST - XEF mainline code
      XEF      - REXX EXEC to invoke XEF (optional if using ISPF command
                                          tables or an option menu to
                                          invoke XEF)
      XEFLIBD  - Same as XEF CLIST but uses LIBDEFs (optional)

   Add the following panels to a library in the ISPPLIB concatenation:
      XEFMENU  - XEF Main Menu
   ** XEFMENUB - Alternate XEF Main Menu (for systems below OS/390 2.10)
      XEFHELP  - XEF Help Panel #1
      XEFHELP2 - XEF Help Panel #2
      XEFHELP3 - XEF Help Panel #3
      XEFHELP4 - XEF Help Panel #4
      XEFINF   - XEF Dataset Info Panel (SEQ)
      XEFINFD  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDS)
      XEFINFE  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDSE)
      XEFINFP  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDS SMS)
      XEFINFS  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (SEQ SMS)

   Add the following messages to a library in the ISPMLIB concatenation:
      XEF00    - XEF Messages

   ** Note: If you want to run XEF 6.4 on systems below OS/390 2.10
      use the XEFMENUB panel instead of XEFMENU.  You should rename the
      panel to XEFMENU during installation.  XEF 6.4 will function as
      it would on systems running OS/390 2.10 or higher, however, no
      verification is done for valid data set names or patterns when
      adding the names to the XEF main menu.  This should work on any
      OS/390 system below OS/390 2.10 or MVS/ESA V5 systems (ISPF 4.2
      or above is required).

 Sample ISPF Commands, Command Usage, and Edit Macro Usage

 The commands are activated by updating the ISPF Command table.  The
 abbreviations for commands and edit macros are achieved by using the
 command table or by renaming EXECs/CLISTSs.  The ISPCMDSA CLIST is an
 example of how to add these commands on a temporary basis without
 actually modifying the ISPF Command Table (ISPCMDS).

 COLADD            Total numbers in a specified column range. An optional
                   parameter of "HEX", "ZONE", "PACK", or "BIN" is needed
                   to add hexadecimal, zoned decimal, packed decimal, or
                   binary data. "DEC" is the default addition type.  The
                   operation can optionally be limited to specific lines if
                   labels are used.  Excluded lines are omitted from the
                   operation.
                   EXAMPLES: COLADD 10 25     ; COLADD 33 40 HEX .A .B

 COLUTIL           1) MOVE, COPY, or SWAP columns to a new location - move
                   is the default. 2) SHIFT columns right or left. 3) CUT
                   (copy) data from specific colimns into the ISPF Default
                   Clipboard. This data can then be used with PASTE later
                   on.  The operation can optionally be limited to
                   specific lines if labels are used.  Excluded lines
                   are omitted from the operation.

                   before the first non blank character, shifting data to
                   the right. The prefix can optionally be limited to specific
                   lines if labels are used. Excluded lines are omitted from
                   the operation.
                   EXAMPLE" PREFIX  "'" ; PRE 'DSN=' .A .B

                   Excluded lines are omitted from the operation.
                   EXAMPLE: SUFFIX "'" ; SUF ',DISP=SHR' .A .B

 SW                Switch from VIEW to EDIT and visa versa. For use with
                   sequential files it requires XVIEW/XEDIT or a similar
