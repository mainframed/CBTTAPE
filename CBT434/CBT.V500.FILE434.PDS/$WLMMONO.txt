               Setting up WLM in a MONOPLEX

 Recommendations:

 You may want to start from scratch as opposed to trying to "convert"
 your IPS/ICS.  A good place for an example of a service policy can
 be found at Cheryl Watson's web site:

         http://www.watsonwalker.com/quickst.html

 Here are a few manuals to review for setting up a monplex with WLM:

        MVS Settings up a Sysplex
        Parallel Sysplex Hardware and Software Migration
          (pay attention to steps for defining WLM Data Sets
           and Policys)
        Planning: Workload Management

 -------------------------------------------------------------------

 Implementation Specifics:

 1) Define XCF couple datasets with the IXCL1DSU utility
    - see SYS1.SAMPLIB(IXCSYSPF)

 2) Create COUPLExx member with data set names and sysplex name.

 3) Update IEASYSxx with PLEXCFG=MONOPLEX,COUPLE=xx

 4) IPL

 5) Define WLM couple datasets.
    - see SYS1.SAMPLIB(IWMFTCDS)
       The WLM dialogs can also be used:
       TSO EX 'SYS1.SBLSCLI0(IWMARIN0)'
       Select UTILITES >> Allocate WLM couple datasets

 6) Use operator command to add the WLM couple datasets:
     SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=WLM,PCOUPLE=(data.set.name)
     SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=WLM,ACOUPLE=(data.set.name)
   *** be sure to update your COUPLExx member with the WLM
       couple data sets.

 7) Now the fun part - create the service definition policy
    via the WLM dialogs (you need security access to the
    FACILITY CLASS resource name of MVSADMIN.WLM.POLICY)

 8) Store the policy via WLM Dialogs

 9) V WLM,POLICY=polname

 10) F WLM,MODE=GOAL  (to switch back - F WLM,MODE=COMPAT)

 To IPL in goal mode - remove IPS=xx & ICS=xx from IEASYSxx.
