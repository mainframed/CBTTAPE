+ This screen is used for%BROWSING, VIEWING, EDITING+or%COMPRESSING+a dataset.
+ It allows you to choose a dataset from a menu instead of typing in the entire
+ dataset name. If a dataset is not listed on the menu, you may still select it
+ by using the%"OTHER DATASET NAME"+field.
+
+ XEF can also be used to obtain%DATASET INFORMATION+or display a%DATASET
+%MEMBER LIST+of a partitioned dataset. From the member list you can select
+ members to be BROWSEd, VIEWed, EDITed, DELETEd, RENAMEd, or PRINTed.
+
+ XEF can also be used to interface with the CBT%PDS+command.
+ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ To start you must add datasets to the menu. To do this, simply tab to one of
+ the dataset name fields (1 thru 99) and type in the dataset name that you wish
+ to have in that field (do not use quotes). The dataset must be cataloged, but
+ the system will not check to see that it is until you try and access it.
+ You can scroll through the dataset list using the UP and DOWN scroll commands.
