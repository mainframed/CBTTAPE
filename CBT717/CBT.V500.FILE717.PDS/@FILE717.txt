//***FILE 717 is from Joseph Caughman and contains his JumpList     *   FILE 717
//*           package which is a way of organizing datasets that    *   FILE 717
//*           a programmer needs, into user-defined groups of       *   FILE 717
//*           datasets, called profiles.                            *   FILE 717
//*                                                                 *   FILE 717
//*           JumpList also allows file tailoring, when submitting  *   FILE 717
//*           JCL for execution.  This means the dynamic substitu-  *   FILE 717
//*           tion of variable values into the JCL, so that one     *   FILE 717
//*           sample of JCL may be used to submit a variety of      *   FILE 717
//*           different actual jobs.                                *   FILE 717

//*        JumpList provides an all-in-one convenient environment   *   FILE 717
//*        for programmers, to make it much easier for one person   *   FILE 717
//*        or a member of a group, to easily organize his or her    *   FILE 717
//*        work.                                                    *   FILE 717
//*                                                                 *   FILE 717
//*        JumpList allows the organization of data set groups      *   FILE 717
//*        by user-defined profile names.  A profile name could     *   FILE 717
//*        relate to the latest ongoing project or could relate     *   FILE 717
//*        to a set of JCL utilities or compile and link JCL.       *   FILE 717
//*        JumpList allows you to Edit, View, or Browse PDS,        *   FILE 717
//*        Sequential data sets, and Generational data sets.        *   FILE 717
//*                                                                 *   FILE 717
//*        It also supports File Tailoring through its Initial      *   FILE 717
//*        Script function.  This provides one way to compile       *   FILE 717
//*        programs or provide other advanced functionality.        *   FILE 717
//*                                                                 *   FILE 717
//*        Delete, copy, and rename functions are left to the       *   FILE 717
//*        DSLIST function of Edit.  DSLIST is equivalent to        *   FILE 717
//*        option 3.4 of ISPF and provides the means to perform     *   FILE 717
//*        data set maintenance.  This function is invoked by       *   FILE 717
//*        using the ESCR, for Edit Screen, command in CMD for      *   FILE 717
//*        a partitioned data set.                                  *   FILE 717
//*                                                                 *   FILE 717
//*        JumpList also simplifies the execution of complicated    *   FILE 717
//*        commands by allowing them to be invoked simply by        *   FILE 717
//*        typing one word.                                         *   FILE 717
//*                                                                 *   FILE 717
