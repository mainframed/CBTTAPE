 Modification Level: V01.02.02

 Corrected Help screen REORGVSH operands.
 Modified Rexx Exec REORGVSX to eliminate some redundant code.
 Modified Abender source to remove jcl (allow it to assemble)
   (Thanks to Michael Mayne)

 Modification Level: V01.02.01

 Added a second invocation Rexx Exec called REORGVSX to
 perform the I/O and work.  Exec REORGVS became a front-end
 exec to invoke an ISPF environment if the user invokes
 REORGVS in the foreground.  REORGVS continues to work
 as it did before if it is invoked in the background with
 the exception that there are now two invocation execs
 (REORGVS which calls REORGVSX to do the work).

 Modified Rexx exec REORGVS
   (requires site tailoring for SYSPROC lib)
 Added one new Rexx exec REORGVSX
   (requires site tailoring for ISPPLIB and ISPMLIB libs)
 Added three new ISPF panels:  REORGPN1, REORGPN2, REOHGPN1
 Added one   new ISPF message member: REOM00
 Modified the SYSHELP panel for REORGVS

 Modification Level: V01.01.08

 Updated REXX execs to add the following two
 user tailoring comment:
 1) Change the length of "sysid" to your specification.
     The default is 3 characters if this is not
     modified.

 Updated REXX exec "REORGVS5" to add the following additional
 tailoring comment:
 2) Change the HLQ of the log dataset to your
     specification.  The default is HLQ is "SYS3".

 Modification Level: V01.01.07

 Added a REXX exec call BADVSAM which identifies VSAM components
 which are defined with the "IMBED", "REPLICATE", and "KEYRANGE"
 parameters.  Calls program 'IGGCSI00' to look through each ICF
 catalog import connected to the master catalog.

 Modification Level: V01.01.06

 REORGVS is a REXX facility which allows a user to reorganize VSAM
 clusters without having to know the specifics of the allocation
 parameters and components associated with the cluster.

 It was written to reallocate and reorg VSAM clusters which were
 defined with the "IMBED" and "REPLICAT" parameters which are no
 longer supported by Z/OS 1.5 and higher.  It was written with the
 express purpose of converting these VSAM clusters, but it is also
 very useful in reorganizing clusters.  The user does not need to
 know the file attributes of the cluster or of the associates
 components in order to reorg a cluster.

 The facility executes REXX execs and IDCAMS in a background job.
 The REXX facility issues IDCAMS commands to parse out the
 DEFINE parameters and creates IDCAMS commands to reallocate the
 VSAM components.

 The reorg facility issues IDCAMS EXPORT and IMPORT FUNCTIONS
 BACKUP/RELOAD the cluster data.

 Multiple clusters can be reorged at the same time.  The REXX
 facility uses a random number suffix for the JOBNAME of each
 reorg job that it submits through the internal reader.

 The facility handles clusters having alternate indexes and paths.

 The facility assumes that RACF is installed as the security product.
 If RACF IS NOT INSTALLED ON YOUR SITE, YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY REXX
 EXEC "REORGVS4" TO ISSUE THE EQUIVALENT STATEMENTS FOR YOUR SECURITY
 PRODUCT AND CHANGES SOME OF THE "REORGVSS" SKELETON).  Alternately,
 you may choose to handle security profiles seperately after the fact.

      REORGVS1 - THIS REXX EXEC BUILDS IDCAMS "LISTCAT" COMMANDS
                 TO LIST THE CLUSTER AND OBTAIN REALLOCATION
                 parameters.  IT ALSO BUILDS THE IDCAMS "EXPORT"
                 AND "IMPORT" STATEMENTS TO EXPORT/IMPORT THE
                 CLUSTER DATA IN IDCAMS STEPS.

                 NO TAILORING IS REQUIRED FOR THIS EXEC.  IT WILL

                 REPORT AND PARSES OUT THE PARAMETERS TO REALLOCATE
                 THE VSAM CLUSTER BY BUILDING IDCAMS "DEFINE CLUSTER"
                 COMMANDS.  IF THE CLUSTER HAS ALTERNATE
                 INDEX ASSOCIATES, IT CREATES IDCAMS "LISTCAT"
                 COMMANDS FOR THE AIX COMPONENTS TO BE PROCESSED
                 IN AN IDCAMS STEP.

      REORGVS4 - THIS REXX EXEC INPUTS A RACF "LISTDSD" SYSPRINT
                 REPORT AND PARSES OUT THE PARAMETERS TO RE-ISSUE
                 THE RACF COMMANDS TO ADD BACK DISCRETE RACF PROFILES
                 (IF THEY EXIST).

                 THIS EXEC (AND FACILITY) ASSUMES THAT THE INSTALLATION
                 USES RACF FOR ITS SECURITY PRODUCT.  IF RACF IS
                 NOT INSTALLED AT YOUR FACILITY, YOU WILL WANT TO
                 OMIT CERTAIN STEPS FROM YOUR REORGVS SKELETON
                 LIBRARY (INCLUDING THE ONE WHICH EXECUTES THIS EXEC -
                 SEE MEMBER "$$DOC FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS).

      REORGVS5 - THIS REXX EXEC INPUTS A "GOOD" OR "BAD" PARAMETER
                 AND LOGS THE REORGANIZATION ENTRY TO A LOG FILE.
                 THE LOG FILE IS DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED BEFORE THE
                 ENTRY IS LOGGED.  THERE WILL BE ONE ENTRY FOR EACH
                 REORG JOB SUBMITTED. IT WILL EITHER LOG A SUCCESS
                 OR A FAILURE WITH THE CLUSTER DATASET NAME, EXPORT
                 IMAGE DATASET NAME, AND THE DATE AND TIME.
                 THE EXEC CALLS ANOTHER EXEC CALLED "DYNALC" TO
                 DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE THE LOG FILE.  "DYNALC" CALLS
                 ASSEMBLER PROGRAM "WAITFOR" (IF IT CANNOT
                 ALLOCATE THE LOG FILE ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT) WHICH
                 IS LINKED INTO THE REORGVS LOAD LIBRARY.

                 NO TAILORING IS REQUIRED FOR THIS EXEC.  IT WILL
                 RESIDE IN "XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.EXEC", BUT THIS EXEC

      REORGVS6 - THIS REXX INPUTS AN IDCAMS EXPORT SYSPRINT REPORT
                 FILE AND PARSES OUT THE RETURN CODES AND MESSAGES
                 TO DETERMINE THE RESULT OF THE EXPORT FUNCTION.
                 EXPORT WILL RETURN A RC=12 WHEN A VSAM CLUSTER IS
                 EMPTY (WITH MSG "IDC3351I" AND FEEDBACK CODE 160).
                 THIS PROGRAM DOES A SMART ANALYSIS TO CHECK
                 THE RESULTS OF THE EXPORT COMMAND INSTEAD OF USING
                 THE RETURN CODE SET BY EXPORT.

                 NO TAILORING IS REQUIRED FOR THIS EXEC.  IT WILL

      DYNALC   - THIS REXX EXEC PERFORMS THE DYNALLOCATION FOR THE
                 LOG FILE ALLOCATION.  IT TRIES UP TO 1800 TIMES TO
                 DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE THE LOG FILE IF THE FILE IS
                 BUSY AND WAITS FOR A 3 SECOND INTERVAL BETWEEN
                 ALLOCATION ATTEMPTS (FOR A TOTAL ELAPSED WINDOW OF
                 90 MINUTES BEFORE IT TIMES OUT).  IT CALLS PROGRAM
                 "WAITFOR" BETWEEN ALLOCATION ATTEMPTS TO ACCOMPLISH
                 THE ECB WAIT INTERVAL IF THE LOG FILE CANNOT BE
                 ALLOCATED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT.

                 NO TAILORING IS REQUIRED FOR THIS EXEC.  IT WILL

                 TAILORED AND SUBMITTED INTO THE INTERNAL READER
                 BY THE "REORGVS" EXEC WHEN IT IS EXECUTED.

                 DO NOT CHANGE THIS MEMBER ONCE IT IS INSTALLED
                 INTO THE "XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL" JCL LIBRARY !!!!!

                 IT IS EXECUTED TO PRODUCE AN ABEND IF ERRORS
                 OCCUR DURING THE REORGVS PROCESSING.

                 THIS PROGRAM WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND LINKED INTO LOAD

                  WHERE THE INSTALL PROCESS COPIES IT TO).


 ASSUMPTIONS
 -----------

   THIS FACILITY ASSUMES THE USE OF IBM'S RACF PRODUCT AS A SECURITY
   PRODUCT.  IF YOUR INSTALLATION USES ANOTHER SECURITY PRODUCT, THIS
   FACILITY WILL NEED TO BE MODIFIED TO WORK.  THE RACF SECURITY
   IS USED ONLY TO RE-CREATE RACF DISCRETE DATASET CLASS PROFILES.
   IF DISCRETE (DISCRET TO A VOLSER) PROFILES ARE NOT BEING USED,
   THEN THE FOLLOWING NINE STEPS CAN BE OMITTED FROM THE REORG JCL
   STREAM IN SKELETON MEMBER "REORGVSS":

     GETRACF, CHK500, ABEND500, BLDRACF, CHK700, ABEND700,
     GENPROF, CHK750, ABEND750.

   ALSO, THE FOLLOWING REXX EXEC CAN BE DISCARDED:  REORGVS4

 CERTIFICATION
 -------------

 BATCH:

   THESE REXX EXECS AND JCL HAVE BEEN RUN IN A Z/OS ENVIRONMENT.
   THE SOURCE CODE FOR "ABENDER" AND "WAITFOR" HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED
   WITH THE HIGH-LEVEL ASSEMBLER AND TESTED.  THEY DO NOT NEED TO
   RUN IN AN AUTHORIZED ENVIRONMENT.  THERE ARE NO SPECIAL
   REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSEMBLING AND LINKING THESE TWO MODULES.
