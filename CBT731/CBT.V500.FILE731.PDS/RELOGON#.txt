)F FUNCTION -
  The RELOGON command is used to allow a quick
  LOGOFF and a quick LOGON afterward, of your userid.

  RELOGON triggers an automatic LOGOFF and a LOGON
  attempt, when your session gets to READY mode.

  If you entered the RELOGON command, and have
  not gotten to READY mode yet, you can nullify
  the automatic LOGOFF by entering the NOLOGOF
  command.

  Action of RELOGON depends on whether the USERID was
  defined by RACF or by SYS1.UADS.  See the note below.

  The original intent of the RELOGON command
  was to make re-entering the password unnecessary.

  This works when the userid was defind by SYS1.UADS
  but it does not work when the userid was defined
  by RACF.  If the userid was defined by RACF, you
  still have to enter the password.  But the process
  is much easier than a manual LOGOFF and a LOGON.

  RELOGON

  (none)

  Note.  If you are in ISPF, the RELOGON command will
         set up a LOGON command to be automatically
         executed when you get to READY mode.

         When the userid was defined by SYS1.UADS,
         and the password was defined by the ACCOUNT
         command, then the command set up by RELOGON is:

         LOGON userid/password

         and you do not have to re-enter the password.

         When the userid was defined by SYS1.UADS, and no
         password was defined by the ACCOUNT command,
         then you don't have to enter the password,
         because it does not exist.  The command set up
         by RELOGON is:

         LOGON userid

         When the userid was defined by RACF, or by another
         security product, then the command set up by
         RELOGON is:

         LOGON userid

         and you will have to re-enter the password,
         because RELOGON could not obtain it from the
         security product.
