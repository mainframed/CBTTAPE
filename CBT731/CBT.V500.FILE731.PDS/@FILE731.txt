//*     1.  The IKJTPVT control block is chained off the TSO Vector *   FILE 731
//*         Table (mapped by IKJTSVT in SYS1.MACLIB), and is OCO    *   FILE 731
//*         officially.  But if you look in the IKJTSVT macro,      *   FILE 731
//*         the pointer to the TPVT control block is officially     *   FILE 731
//*         documented.  And if you look at the TPVT in storage,    *   FILE 731
//*         it is pretty obvious that X'20' off the beginning,      *   FILE 731
//*         points to the IKJEESCB control block, which contains    *   FILE 731
//*         the BROADCAST and USERLOG dataset status, and (in       *   FILE 731
//*         TSO/E Release 3 and higher, where BROADCAST dataset     *   FILE 731

//*         therefore included the necessary macros from the        *   FILE 731
//*         SHOWzOS maclib, called IKJTPVT and IKJCTLT, for         *   FILE 731

//*     3.  Older versions of the IKJEESCB control block are        *   FILE 731
//*         supported here, too.  These are TSO/E Release 2 and     *   FILE 731
//*         lower, going up to z/OS 1.2.  At those levels,          *   FILE 731
//*         BROADCAST dataset switching was not yet supported,      *   FILE 731
//*         so the extension to the IKJEESCB control block that     *   FILE 731
//*         supports an alternate BROADCAST dataset is not yet      *   FILE 731
//*         there.  But in IKJEESCB level 2, all of the PARMLIB     *   FILE 731
//*         UPDATE stuff IS there, except for the dataset switch-   *   FILE 731
//*         ing stuff.  In IKJEESCB level 1, less detail about      *   FILE 731
//*         the TSO Userlogs is retained in the control block.      *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     4.  It seems that the purpose of the IKJTPVT control        *   FILE 731
//*         block is to point to all the information that is        *   FILE 731
//*         involved in either a PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) TSO command     *   FILE 731
//*         execution, or (in TSO/E Release 3) a SET IKJTSO=xx      *   FILE 731
//*         operator command, which does the same thing.  So any    *   FILE 731
//*         new control blocks that are involved with the           *   FILE 731
//*         IKJTSOxx parameters, are pointed to by the TPVT.  It    *   FILE 731
//*         seems to me, that IBM wants to keep some flexibility    *   FILE 731
//*         with regard to new development of TSO-based system      *   FILE 731
//*         controls, so that is why they are keeping the IKJTPVT   *   FILE 731
//*         control block OCO.  (Also, the pointers to the "auth"   *   FILE 731
//*         tables are there.)  Nevertheless, we are using it,      *   FILE 731
//*         because we have to.                                     *   FILE 731

//*         TSO/E Release 3, I have pulled the stops out, and I     *   FILE 731

//*         the BROADCAST dataset that there is.  (With the         *   FILE 731

//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     The output of the EESCB command, especially for TSO/E       *   FILE 731
//*     Release 3, is quite long, so rather than having it          *   FILE 731
//*     overflow several screens, I have tried to use the PUTLINE   *   FILE 731
//*     interface to the TSO screen, which is "capturable" by the   *   FILE 731
//*     SYSOUTTRAP service, rather than using the TPUT interface    *   FILE 731
//*     to the screen, which is not capturable.                     *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     However, in coding the EESCB command, I used the TPUT       *   FILE 731
//*     interface first, which is much simpler to code and set      *   FILE 731
//*     up.  This made for easier development.                      *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     After having coded EESCB using TPUT, I then converted it    *   FILE 731
//*     to PUTLINE using Howard Dean and Jim Elsworth's interface   *   FILE 731
//*     to set up PUTLINE, which is included here, too, for your    *   FILE 731
//*     edification and easy access (originally from CBT File 136). *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     This PUTLINE interface works as follows:                    *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     A program called EPUTL, which can be separately assembled   *   FILE 731
//*     and linkedited, sets up the PUTLINE interface externally    *   FILE 731
//*     from the TSO command which calls it.  The call to EPUTL     *   FILE 731
//*     is then set up by a macro called APUT, which has the same   *   FILE 731
//*     coding rules as a single line TPUT.  Therefore, if you      *   FILE 731
//*     linkedit the EPUTL routine into your TSO command load       *   FILE 731
//*     module, and you convert all coded TPUTs in the source code  *   FILE 731
//*     to APUTs, then the TSO screen interface is automagically    *   FILE 731
//*     transformed from TPUT to PUTLINE.                           *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     The EPUTL program assumes that the calling TSO command      *   FILE 731
//*     had been set up properly, using standard IBM linkage        *   FILE 731
//*     conventions.  Once that has been assumed, and if it is      *   FILE 731
//*     indeed true, EPUTL can nose around in the caller's saved    *   FILE 731
//*     registers and pull out the caller's CPPL, so that it can    *   FILE 731
//*     set up the PUTLINE environment and issue the PUTLINE        *   FILE 731
//*     macro, independently linkedited from the calling program.   *   FILE 731
//*     It is a nice idea.  Most TSO commands are properly coded,   *   FILE 731
//*     and therefore it is possible to set up PUTLINE service in   *   FILE 731
//*     this easy manner.                                           *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     This system makes TSO command coding (that has terminal     *   FILE 731
//*     outputs) much easier too, because you can code the outputs  *   FILE 731
//*     using TPUT and convert them to PUTLINE later.               *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*     The EESCB source code already includes the APUT and the     *   FILE 731
//*     EPUTL source, together with it inline.  But I have          *   FILE 731
//*     nevertheless put separate copies of them into this pds,     *   FILE 731
//*     so you don't have to go to the trouble of extracting        *   FILE 731
//*     them, if you want to use them for other applications.       *   FILE 731

//*     TSOR SYSOUTTRAPs the TSO command output, and allocates a    *   FILE 731
//*     temporary file, which it displays using the REVIEW command  *   FILE 731
//*     from CBT File 134 (load modules on File 135).  REVIEW       *   FILE 731
//*     works either from within ISPF, or from TSO READY mode.      *   FILE 731
//*     So TSOR EESCB works from TSO READY mode as well as from     *   FILE 731
//*     an ISPF command line, as TSO TSOR EESCB.                    *   FILE 731

//*     To use the TSOE, TSOB, TSOV, and TSOR execs, just copy      *   FILE 731

//*   I added another command called CINMX, which will reset        *   FILE 731
//*   the TRANSREC OUTLIM number as a TSO command.  (It will be     *   FILE 731
//*   helpful to remember the old number before running this        *   FILE 731
//*   command.)  You just run the TSO command:                      *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*   CINMX nnnnnn     where nnnnnn has to be numeric, up to 10     *   FILE 731
//*                    digits, and the OUTLIM is reset in core,     *   FILE 731
//*                    to this value.                               *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731

//*   Of necessity this command has to be APF authorized.           *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*   Reason for this command:                                      *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*   If you want to transmit a large file, and your installation   *   FILE 731
//*   won't allow it because the TRANSREC OUTLIM value in PARMLIB   *   FILE 731
//*   was too low, you can just adjust it up, transmit your file,   *   FILE 731
//*   and adjust it back.  Now, with the W and I parameters, you    *   FILE 731
//*   can use CINMX to adjust the Warn Threshold and Warn Interval  *   FILE 731
//*   values, too.  You can test the results of the CINMX command   *   FILE 731
//*   by running the INMXD command, which displays the INMXPARM     *   FILE 731
//*   control block values currently in storage.                    *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
//*   Note: -                                                       *   FILE 731
//*   The CINMX program will also work at the OS/390 1.3 level and  *   FILE 731
//*   before, even though the displacements into the INMXPARM       *   FILE 731
//*   control block were 4 bytes earlier.  (CINMX Ver 1.2)          *   FILE 731
//*   All of these commands were tested on MVS systems back to      *   FILE 731
//*   ESA 5.2.2 and up through z/OS 2.3.                            *   FILE 731
//*                                                                 *   FILE 731
