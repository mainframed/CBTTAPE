        This package adds CLIST variables that contain system
        information.  Once these variables have been added to
        your system, you can inquire on them with CLISTS and
        utilize or display the system information.

        Submission:  MVS TSO/E module IKJCT44B - TSO/E Installation-Written
                     Built-In Function

        File IKJCT44B.ULD is a downloaded copy of an IEBCOPY unload of the
        complete source PDS.  The rest of the files on the floppy are each
        of the individual members of the same PDS.  I'm not sure what format
        is needed for inclusion on the CBT tape, so I'm sending it both ways.

        The attached floppy disk contains the source and object modules for
        IKJCT44B.  The functions performed by this module are described below
        and in $DOC.TXT.

        Module IKJCT44B provides the following CLIST variables:

         &SYSXACCT        Contains the account number used to LOGON to
                          TSO.
         &SYSXCPUH        Contains the number of CPU seconds used during
                          session in form secondshh.
         &SYSXCPUTYPE     Contains the machine type of the CPU this TSO
                          session is executing on.
         &SYSXDFP         Contains the level of the DFP product installed
                          on the system in form vrrm.
         &SYSXIPLAT       Contains the date and time of the last IPL of
                          the operating system.
         &SYSXLU          Contains the LU name (terminal ID) of the
                          terminal being used or null.
         &SYSXMVS         Contains the name and SMP function ID of the
                          the MVS operating system being used.
         &SYSXRES         Contains the volume serial number of the
                          system residence volume (SYSRES).
         &SYSXSERIAL      Contains the machine serial number of the CPU
                          this TSO session is executing on.
         &SYSXSMFID       Contains the SMF ID of the MVS operating system
                          this TSO session executing on.

        Members of the PDS:

          ASM        JCL used to assemble the Object deck OBJCT44B
          IKJCT44B   Asm deck of IKJCT44B.
          OBJCT44B   Object deck of IKJCT44B.
          SESSION    A CLIST used to demonstrate use of the new variables.
          SYSTEM     A CLIST used to demonstrate use of the new variables.
          TS40084    A SMP/E USERMOD used to apply MOD IKJCT44B.
          VARIABLE   A short description of all CLIST variables.
