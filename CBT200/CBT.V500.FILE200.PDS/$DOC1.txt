   Ran COBREAD by Roland Schiradin, who is an expert (the author
   of COBANAL on File 321).  Roland noticed that the S0C4 can be
   avoided by linkediting COBREAD and COBFMT with AMODE ANY or
   AMODE 31.  Fixed dates of the format 00.nnn , in COBREAD.

   This program still needs a lot of modernization, and a second
   base register.

   Fixed WHATSNEW and WHEREUSD for Y2K.  Reformatted yy.ddd date
   in the report headers to have X'F0' for the fill character in
   the edit pattern PAT01, and blanked out the first zero, so the
   year comes out as 00.045, for example.  Second fix was the sort.
   Used the Y2D sort parameter, so the year 00 sorts ahead of 99.

   Tried to run COBREAD program, but it gets an S0C4, running past
   the end of the CESD Table.  For now, I'd suggest using the far
   more modern program:  COBANAL from Roland Schiradin on File 321
   of the CBT MVS Utilities Tape.

   Tried WHATSNEW program using DFSORT on MVS/ESA 4.3 with DFSORT 12.0.
   It seems that with DFSORT, the "delete record" code from an
   Assembler E35 exit routine should be 4 instead of 12.  I also
   took out the size parameter from the sort parms, and let it
   default.  Seems to work OK on our system.  Increased size of CESD
   table - made it 4x bigger.  Works on SYS1.LINKLIB and SYS1.NUCLEUS.
   Ran pgm with 9000K region.  May not need this much.  But we have
   bigger systems nowadays.

*     MADE 3 CHANGES:                                                 *
*         1.  ELIMINATED SIZE PARAMETER FROM SORT INVOCATION.         *
*         2.  INCREASED SIZE OF CESD TABLE 4X (LABEL "GETLEN").       *
*         3.  DFSORT HAS A DIFFERENT RETURN CODE FROM AN ASSEMBLER    *
*              E35 EXIT, TO DELETE A RECORD.  IT IS 4 INSTEAD OF 12.  *
