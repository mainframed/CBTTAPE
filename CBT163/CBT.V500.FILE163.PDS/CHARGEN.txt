      DESCRIPTION
      -----------
      "CHARGEN" IS A POSTER PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY, "CHARGEN" PRINTS
      LARGE REPRODUCTIONS OF EBCDIC CHARACTERS ACCEPTED FROM THE INPUT
      STREAM. THESE CHARACTERS USUALLY FORM WORDS AND/OR PHRASES.
      "CHARGEN" CAN REPRODUCE UPPER CASE AND LOWER CASE ALPHABETIC
      CHARACTERS, AS WELL AS NUMERALS AND MORE THAN 30 SPECIAL CHARAC-
      TERS. THERE ARE SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES OF CHARGEN WHICH ARE EX-
      PLAINED FULLY BELOW. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS DOCUMENT BE READ
      CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY ATTEMPT IS MADE TO USE "CHARGEN". FAILURE TO
      DO SO WILL LEAVE THE USER UNAWARE OF MANY OF THE EXTRA CONVENIEN-
      CES IN "CHARGEN", AND MAY ALSO LEAD TO UNEXPECTED AND UNWANTED
      RESULTS.
-     INVOKING CHARGEN
      -------- -------
      CHARGEN REQUIRES AN 18K REGION FOR EXECUTION. THE INPUT DATASET
      MUST BE LRECL=80, AND HAS THE DDNAME "SYSIN". THE OUTPUT DATASET
      IS NORMALLY A SYSOUT DATASET (RECFM=FBA, LRECL=133, BLKSIZE=133),
      WITH THE DDNAME "SYSPRINT". TYPICAL JCL WOULD BE:
0          //         JOB
           /*JOBPARM  PSS=NO,LINECT=0,LINES=9999,CPU=15,IO=0
           // EXEC PGM=CHARGEN
           //STEPLIB DD DSN=...,DISP=SHR
           //SYSIN DD *
                .
                .
                .
           /*
           //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
0     THE "JOBPARM" PARAMETERS MAY BE ABBREVIATED:
           /*JOBPARM  S=NO,K=0,L=9999,Z=15,Y=0
0     THE CPU (Z) VALUE MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED IF MORE THAN 150 CHAR-
      ACTERS ARE TO BE REPRODUCED. THE AVERAGE REPRODUCTION RATE IS
      10-15 CHARACTERS PER CPU SECOND. AT PEAK PERFORMANCE (DETERMINED
      BY THE CONTENTS OF THE INPUT STREAM), HOWEVER, THE REPRODUCTION
      RATE IS 15-20 CHARACTERS PER CPU SECOND.
1     CONTENTS OF THE INPUT STREAM
      -------- -- --- ----- ------
0     THE BACKGROUND CONTROL CHARACTER -
           CHARGEN MAY HAVE ANY NUMBER OF INPUT CARDS. COLUMN 1 ON EACH
           CARD IS RESERVED FOR THE BACKGROUND CONTROL CHARACTER. THIS
           CHARACTER IS THE CHARACTER WHICH IS USED AS THE BACKGROUND
           ON WHICH THE INPUT STREAM IS REPRODUCED. IF THE BACKGROUND
           CONTROL CHARACTER IS A BLANK, THE CHARACTER PATTERNS ARE
           CONSTRUCTED FROM THE EBCDIC CHARACTERS WHICH THE PATTERNS
           REPRESENT, OR FROM ANOTHER CHARACTER WHICH SHOWS UP BETTER
           ON PAPER. FOR EXAMPLE, "A" IS MADE FROM EBCDIC "A", "B" IS
           MADE FROM EBCDIC "B", AND "." IS MADE FROM EBCDIC "O". WHEN
           THE BACKGROUND CONTROL CHARACTER FOR ANY CARD IS NOT A
           BLANK, HOWEVER, "CHARGEN" WILL OPERATE IN "REVERSE IMAGE
           MODE" FOR THAT CARD. FOR EXAMPLE, IF COLUMN 1 CONTAINS A
           DOLLAR SIGN ("$"), THE OUTPUT WILL CONSIST OF SOLID DOLLAR
           SIGNS, WITH THE CHARACTER PATTERNS LEFT AS BLANK AREAS.

0          (NOTE: THE FIGURE ABOVE DOES NOT SHOW THE ACTUAL PATTERN
                SIZE OR SHAPE)
0          A BACKGROUND CONTROL CHARACTER IS ONLY EFFECTIVE FOR THE
           CHARACTERS ON THE SAME CARD. A NEW BACKGROUND CONTROL CHAR-
           ACTER IS OBTAINED FROM EACH CARD.
1     SPECIFYING THE INFORMATION TO BE REPRODUCED -
           THE ACTUAL CHARACTERS THAT ARE TO BE REPRODUCED MAY APPEAR
           IN COLUMNS 2-80 ON A CARD. THE REPRODUCTION OF A CARD WILL
           TERMINATE AT THE LAST NON-BLANK CHARACTER ON THE CARD. TO
           REPRODUCE NUMERALS OR UPPER CASE ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS, SIM-
           PLY CODE THEM DIRECTLY ON THE CARD. LOWER CASE ALPHABETIC
           CHARACTERS MAY BE CODED DIRECTLY ALSO (IE: FROM AN "ASIS"
           TSO DATASET), OR BY PRECEDING THE UPPER CASE EQUIVALENTS OF
           THE LOWER CASE CHARACTERS, WITH THE EBCDIC LOGICAL NOT("¬").
           FOR EXAMPLE, TO REPRODUCE THE WORD "HELLO" WITH ALL BUT THE
           "H" IN LOWER CASE, CODE:  H¬E¬L¬L¬O . THE "¬" IS NOT VALID
           FOR NUMERALS. IF IT IS USED WITH A NUMERAL, BOTH THE "¬" AND
           THE NUMERAL WILL BE IGNORED. A "¬" PRECEDING A LOWER CASE
           CHARACTER HAS NO EFFECT, AND THE CHARACTER WILL BE REPRO-
           DUCED AS IF THE "¬" WAS NOT THERE. THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL
           CHARACTERS ARE AVAILABLE, AND MAY BE CODED DIRECTLY ON A
           CARD:
0                  (BLANK)                    -  (HYPHEN)
                ¢  (CENT)                     /  (SLASH)
                .  (PERIOD)                   ,  (COMMA)
                <  (LESS THAN)                %  (PERCENT)
                (  (LEFT PAREN)               >  (GREATER THAN)
                +  (PLUS SIGN)                ?  (QUESTION MARK)
                &  (AMPERSAND)                :  (COLON)
                !  (EXCLAMATION POINT)        #  (NUMBER SIGN)
                $  (DOLLAR SIGN)              @  (APIECE SIGN)
                *  (ASTERISK)                 '  (APOSTROPHE)
                )  (RIGHT PAREN)              =  (EQUAL SIGN)
                ;  (SEMI-COLON)               "  (OPEN QUOTE)
0          THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL CHARACTERS ARE AVAILABLE BY PRECEDING
           ANOTHER SPECIAL CHARACTER WITH "¬":
0               LEFT ARROW                    ¬<  (LESS THAN)
                LEFT BRACE                    ¬(  (LEFT PAREN)
                VERTICAL BAR                  ¬|  (VERTICAL BAR)
                PLAYBOY RABBIT                ¬$  (DOLLAR SIGN)

                REVERSE SLASH                 ¬/  (SLASH)
                RIGHT ARROW                   ¬>  (GREATER THAN)
                NOT EQUAL SIGN                ¬=  (EQUAL)
                CLOSE QUOTE                   ¬"  (OPEN QUOTE)
0          (NOTE: VERTICAL BAR IS GENERATED BY "¬|" BECAUSE A "|" WITH-
           OUT THE "¬" HAS A SPECIAL MEANING WHICH IS DESCRIBED LATER)
0          IF A "¬" PRECEDES A SPECIAL CHARACTER WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A
           "¬" COUNTERPART, THE "¬" AND THE CHARACTER THAT FOLLOWS IT
           WILL BE IGNORED.
1     UNDERSCORING
           ANY CHARACTER(S) IN THE INPUT STREAM MAY BE UNDERSCORED WHEN
           THEY ARE REPRODUCED. SIMPLY PRECEDE THE CHARACTER(S) TO BE
           REPRODUCED WITH A "_" CHARACTER. FOR EXAMPLE:
0                         _1
                          _A
                          _¬A
                          _$
                          _¬$
                          _H_¬E_¬L_¬L_¬O
0          AN UNDERSCORE CHARACTER ALONE MAY BE GENERATED BY CODING
           "_ " (BLANK) IN THE INPUT STREAM. WHEN "CHARGEN" IS IN RE-
           VERSE IMAGE MODE, THE UNDERSCORES ARE ALSO REVERSED.
1     CONTROL WORDS
           CONTROL WORDS ARE 5 LETTER KEYWORDS WHICH APPEAR IN COLUMNS
           1-5 OF A CARD. THE REMAINDER OF THE CARD MUST BE BLANK. IF
           IT ISN'T, THE CARD WILL BE TREATED AS A NORMAL INPUT CARD.
           THE LAST FOUR CHARACTERS OF THE CONTROL WORD WILL BE REPRO-
           DUCED, AND THE FIRST CHARACTER OF THE CONTROL WORD WILL BE
           THE BACKGROUND CONTROL CHARACTER. SIMILAR ERRORS WILL RESULT
           IF YOU MISSPELL A CONTROL WORD. ANY CONTROL WORD MAY BE
           ISSUSED AS MANY TIMES AS DESIRED IN A SINGLE RUN. A CONTROL
           WORD REQUEST TO INVOKE A SPECIAL PROCESSING FACILITY WHICH
           HAS ALREADY BEEN INVOKED, WILL NOT CAUSE AN ERROR.
-          "EJECT" -
                IF A MESSAGE TO BE REPRODUCED REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE
                CARD, "CHARGEN" WILL ALLOW THIS AS LONG AS COLUMN 1 OF
                EACH CARD CONTAINS A BACKGROUND CONTROL CHARACTER. FOR
                EXAMPLE:
0                         *THI
                          *S IS A
                          * MESSA
                          *GE.
0               OCCASIONALLY, HOWEVER, YOU MAY WANT TO GENERATE SEVERAL
                MESSAGES IN ONE RUN. THE "EJECT" CONTROL WORD WILL
                CAUSE "CHARGEN" TO EJECT 1 PAGE IN ITS OUTPUT STREAM.
                FOR EXAMPLE:
0                         *THIS IS A MESSAGE.
                          EJECT
                          $THIS IS ANOTHER MESSAGE.
-          "LCASE" -
                THIS CONTROL WORD ONLY AFFECTS UPPER CASE ALPHABETIC
                CHARACTERS IN THE INPUT STREAM. AFTER YOU HAVE ISSUED
                THE "LCASE" COMMAND, ALL UPPER CASE ALPHABETIC INPUT
                WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CONVERTED TO LOWER CASE. IF YOU
                WANT AN UPPER CASE CHARACTER WHILE IN "LCASE" MODE, YOU
                MAY PRECEDE THE CHARACTER WITH THE LOGICAL NOT ("¬").
                FOR EXAMPLE:
0               H¬E¬L¬L¬O    IS THE SAME AS   LCASE
                                               ¬HELLO
-          "UCASE" -
                REVERSES THE EFFECT OF THE "LCASE" COMMAND, AND RETURNS
                CASE CONVERSION TO NORMAL.
1          "ULINE" -
                THE "ULINE" CONTROL WORD DOES THE SAME THING FOR UNDER-
                SCORING, THAT "LCASE" DOES FOR CASE CONVERSION. AFTER
                YOU HAVE ISSUED THE "ULINE" COMMAND, ALL OUTPUT WILL BE
                UNDERSCORED. INDIVIDUAL UNDERSCORE SUPPRESSION MAY BE
                OBTAINED BY PRECEDING THE CHARACTER(S) WITH "_". FOR
                EXAMPLE:
0               _H_¬E_¬L_¬L_¬O T¬H¬E¬R¬E      IS THE SAME AS
0               ULINE
                 H¬E¬L¬L¬O_ _T_¬H_¬E_¬R_¬E
-          "NLINE" -
                REVERSES THE EFFECT OF "ULINE" AND RETURNS UNDERSCORE
                PROCESSING TO NORMAL.
0          WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONTROL WORDS, THE LAST EXAMPLE MAY
           BE CODED AS FOLLOWS:
0                         LCASE
                          ULINE
                           ¬HELLO
                          NLINE
                           ¬THERE
-     SPECIAL CONTROL SYMBOL "|" (VERTICAL BAR)
           THE VERTICAL BAR IS USED TO MARK THE END OF ONE CARD AND THE
           BEGINNING OF ANOTHER. LOGICALLY, THE FIRST CHARACTER AFTER A
           VERTICAL BAR IS A BACKGROUND CONTROL CHARACTER, OR THE FIRST
           CHARACTER OF A CONTROL WORD. THE LAST EXAMPLE COULD HAVE
           BEEN CODED AS FOLLOWS:
0                    LCASE|ULINE| ¬HELLO|NLINE| ¬THERE
0          OR IF YOU WANT THE WORD "THERE" TO BE IN REVERSE IMAGE, WITH
           A BACKGROUND OF "#":
0                    LCASE|ULINE| ¬HELLO|NLINE|#¬THERE
0          OBVIOUSLY, A VERTICAL BAR CAN BE USED TO ADD TRAILING
           BLANKS TO A MESSAGE, IE:   $HELLO        |
1     RETURN CODES FROM "CHARGEN"
           0 - "CHARGEN" EXECUTED NORMALLY
0          4 - THERE WERE CHARACTERS IN THE INPUT STREAM WHICH COULD
               NOT BE REPRODUCED (IE:  ¬5   OR   ¬#)
0          8 - EITHER THE "SYSIN" OR THE "SYSPRINT" DD CARD IS MISSING.
               NO OUTPUT IS GENERATED.

*     REGISTER USAGE
*     -------- -----
*     R8 THRU R12 ARE BASE REGISTERS FOR THE MAIN CSECT - "CHARGEN".
*        CURRENTLY, R11 AND R12 ARE NOT NEEDED, BUT THE ADDRESSABILITY
*        OF R8-R10 IS ALMOST EXHAUSTED; AND FUTURE PROGRAM MODIFICA-
*        TIONS, OR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADDITIONAL CHARACTER PATTERNS,
*        WILL PROBABLY MAKE USE OF THE EXTRA BASE REGISTERS.
*
*     R13 IS THE BASE REGISTER FOR THE DSECT, WHICH CONTAINS:
*        SAVEAREA, I/O WORKAREAS, A TRANSLATE TABLE, AND DEFAULT
*        CASE/UNDERSCORE FLAGS.
*
*     WE ALL KNOW ABOUT R14, R15, R0, AND R1.
*
*     R2 IS CLEARED EARLY IN THE PROGRAM. IT IS USED BY "IC", "TRT",
*        AND CONTAINS F'1' AS THE INCREMENT USED BY "BXH" INSTRUCTIONS.
*
*     R3 POINTS TO THE LAST NON-BLANK CHARACTER IN THE INPUT BUFFER.
*
*     R4 POINTS TO THE CHARACTER IN THE INPUT BUFFER, WHICH IS
*        CURRENTLY BEING ANALYZED OR REPRODUCED.
*
*     R5 IS A GENERAL WORK REGISTER. IT IS USED FOR LOOP COUNTERS, AND
*        AS THE RETURN REGISTER FROM "BAL" TO THE OUTPUT ROUTINE.
*
*     R6 IS ANOTHER WORK REGISTER, BUT IS USED PRIMARILY AS A POINTER
*        TO EACH ELEMENT, IN SUCCESSION, OF A CHARACTER PATTERN.
*
*     R7 CONTAINS THE ADDRESS, IN THE OUTPUT BUFFER, OF THE FIRST
*        USABLE (MODIFYABLE) BYTE. ALTERING THIS ADDRESS ALTERS THE
*        LEFT AND RIGHT MARGINS, ABOVE AND BELOW THE CHARACTERS THAT
*        ARE REPRODUCED. THIS INFORMATION MIGHT BE HANDY IF "CHARGEN"
*        IS USED ON A PRINTER WHICH IS NOT 132 CHARACTERS WIDE.
*        (NOTE: THE CHARACTERS PRODUCED BY "CHARGEN" WERE DESIGNED AT
*        EIGHT LINES PER INCH).

*     EACH PATTERN CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING:
*        1) THE FIRST BYTE IS THE CHARACTER TO BE USED IN CONSTRUCTING
*           THE OUTPUT, WHEN IN NORMAL-IMAGE MODE. (IE: "A" IS THE
*           FIRST BYTE IN THE PATTERN FOR THE LETTER "A", SO THE LETTER
*           "A" WILL BE BUILT FROM THE EBCDIC CHARACTER "A".)
*        2) THE REMAINDER OF EACH PATTERN CONSISTS OF A VARIABLE NUMBER
*           OF TWO-BYTE ELEMENTS:
*
*                       BIT 0                        BITS 1-7
*     BYTE 1 "ON" INDICATES THAT THIS      THE OFFSET FROM THE ADDRESS
*            ELEMENT IS THE LAST ELEMENT   IN R7 WHERE THE RESULT OF
*            FOR THE CURRENT OUTPUT LINE.  THIS ELEMENT IS TO BE PLACED
*                                          (NOTE: IF THE OFFSET IS 0,
*                                          AND BIT 0 IS "ON", THE CUR-

*                                          ELEMENT).
*
*     BYTE 2 "ON" INDICATES THAT THIS      THE "LENGTH-1" (IN BYTES) OF
*            ELEMENT IS THE LAST ELEMENT   THE SEGMENT OF THE OUTPUT
