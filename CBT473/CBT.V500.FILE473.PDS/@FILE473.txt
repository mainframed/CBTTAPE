//***FILE 473 is from Scott Finlayson, and contains a program to    *   FILE 473
//*           check for all ASID's (address space id slots) that    *   FILE 473
//*           have become non-reusable. The program displays the    *   FILE 473
//*           list of non-reusable ASID's at the console,           *   FILE 473
//*           together with the total number of ASID's defined,     *   FILE 473
//*           and the total number still available.  Tells you      *   FILE 473
//*           when it's time to IPL.  Useful if you're like our     *   FILE 473
//*           shop and wait a long time between IPL's.  Good for    *   FILE 473
//*           a 24x7, or a pseudo 24x7 environment.                 *   FILE 473

//*           Submitted by Ron Robinson.                            *   FILE 473
//*                                                                 *   FILE 473
//*           Sample output for the program follows:                *   FILE 473
//*                                                                 *   FILE 473

//* ASID MAX = 00528; ASIDS AVAILABLE = 00147; NON-REUSABLES = 00221*   FILE 473

//*           CHKASVT can be run from TSO as well, as a command,    *   FILE 473
//*           but it also puts its output to the system log, at     *   FILE 473
//*           the same time.                                        *   FILE 473
