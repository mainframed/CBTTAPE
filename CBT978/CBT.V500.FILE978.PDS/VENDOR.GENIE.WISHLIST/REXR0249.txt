NChapter 2. REXX general concepts
N--------------------------------
N  Commands to external environments
N  ---------------------------------
N      Host command environments for linking to and attaching programs
N      ---------------------------------------------------------------
NTSO/E provides the LINK, LINKMVS, and LINKPGM host command
Nenvironments that let you link to unauthorized programs on the same
Ntask level.
N
NTSO/E also provides the ATTACH, ATTCHMVS, and ATTCHPGM host command
Nenvironments that let you attach unauthorized programs on a different
Ntask level.
N
NThe differences between the environments are the format of the
Nparameter list that the program receives, the capability of passing
Nmultiple parameters, variable substitution for the parameters, and the
Nability of the invoked program to update the parameters.
N
N
N-> For the LINK and ATTACH environments, you can specify only a single
N   character string that gets passed to the program. The LINK and
N   ATTACH environments do not evaluate the character string and do
N   not perform variable substitution. The environments simply pass
N   the string to the invoked program. The program can use the
N   character string it receives. However, the program cannot return
N   an updated string to the exec.
N
N-> For the LINKMVS, LINKPGM, ATTCHMVS, and ATTCHPGM environments, you
N   can pass multiple parameters to the program. The environments
N   evaluate the parameters you specify and perform variable
N   substitution. That is, the environment determines the value of each
N   variable. When the environment invokes the program, the environment
N   passes the value of each variable to the program. The program can
N   update the parameters it receives and return the updated values to
N   the exec.

MSee the manual if you have a need or desire tO use these methods of
Minvoking a program.
