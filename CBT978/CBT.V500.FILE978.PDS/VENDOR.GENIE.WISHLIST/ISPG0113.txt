NChapter 1. Introduction to ISPF services
N----------------------------------------
NA summary of the ISPF services
N------------------------------
NPDF component services
N----------------------
NPDF component services consist of BRIF (Browse Interface), BROWSE,
NEDIF (Edit Interface), EDIREC (edit recovery for EDIF), EDIT, VIEW,
NVIIF, and EDREC (edit recovery for EDIT and VIEW), along with the
Nlibrary access services listed in "Library access services".
N
NBRIF:     Provides browse functions for data accessed through
N          dialog-supplied I/O routines. It allows you to browse data
N          other than partitioned data sets or sequential files, such
N          as subsystem data and in-storage data, and to preprocess the
N          data being browsed.
N
NBROWSE:   Can be used to look at any ISPF library, concatenation of
N          ISPF libraries, or data set that can be allocated by using
N          the LMINIT service, and certain other data types not
N          supported by ISPF. You can browse host data sets on the
N          workstation or workstation files on the host.
N
NEDIF:     Provides edit functions for data accessed through
N          dialog-supplied I/O routines. It allows you to edit data
N          other than partitioned data sets or sequential files,
N          as subsystem data and in-storage data, and to
N          preprocess the data being browsed.
N
NEDIREC:   Initializes an edit recovery table (ISREIRT) for use by the
N          EDIF service and determines whether recovery from the EDIF
N          service is pending.
N
NEDIT:     Can be used to look at any ISPF library, concatenation of
N          ISPF libraries, or data set that can be allocated by using
N          the LMINIT service. The EDIT service provides an interface
N          to the PDF editor and bypasses the display of the Edit Entry
N          Panel on the host. You can also edit host files on the
N          workstation or workstation files on the host.
N
NEDREC:    Initializes an edit or view recovery table, determines
N          whether recovery is pending, and takes the action specified
N          by the first argument.
N
NVIEW:     Functions exactly like the EDIT service, with these
N          exceptions:
N
N          1. You must use the REPLACE or CREATE primary command to save
N             data.
N
N          2. When you enter the END primary command after altering a
N             file in VIEW mode, you will be prompted to either save the
N             changes or exit without saving them.
N
NVIIF:     Provides edit functions for data accessed through
N          dialog-supplied I/O routines. It enables you to view data
N          other than partitioned data sets or sequential files, such
N          as subsystem data and in-storage data, and to preprocess the
N          data being viewed.
