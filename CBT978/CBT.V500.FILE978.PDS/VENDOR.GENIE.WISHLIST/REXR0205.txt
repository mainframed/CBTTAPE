N=========================
NChapter 2. REXX general concepts
N--------------------------------
N  Structure and general syntax
N  ----------------------------
NImplied semicolons
N------------------
NThe last element in a clause is the semicolon delimiter. The language
Nprocessor implies the semicolon: at a line-end, after certain
Nkeywords, and after a colon if it follows a single symbol. This means
Nthat you need to include semicolons only when there is more than one
Nclause on a line or to end an instruction whose last character is a
Ncomma.
M
MThere is a performance penalty for explicitely coding a semicolon on
Ma single clause line or after the last clause as the REXX interpreter
Massumes another clause follows on the same line only to find there
Mis none.
