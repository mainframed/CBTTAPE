NRANDOM
N-------
NRANDOM returns a quasi-random nonnegative whole number in the range
Nmin to max inclusive. If you specify max or min or both, max minus min
Ncannot exceed 100000. The min and max default to 0 and 999,
Nrespectively. To start a repeatable sequence of results, use a
Nspecific seed as the third argument, as described in Note 1. This
Nseed must be a positive whole number ranging from 0 to 999999999.
N
NNotes:
N1. To obtain a predictable sequence of quasi-random numbers, use RANDOM
N   a number of times, but specify a seed only the first time.
N
N   If you do not supply a seed, the first time RANDOM is called, an
N   arbitrary seed is used. Hence, your program usually gives different
N   results each time it is run.
N
MMessage from Kenneth Tomiak:
MNewbies always think RANDOM will be unpredictable. It is not. The more
Mrandom you want your number, the harder you need to work to get it
Mrandom. That is where the SEED comes into play. I have no magic to
Mmake a truly random number. The best I come up with is using the date
Mtime, and used cpuseconds as a seed.
N
N
NSyntax:
D  RANDOM(max | min,, max ,seed)
I    min: The smallest whole number you will accept.
N
I    max: The largest whole number you will accept.
N
I    seed: A whole number to influence the randomness.

NExample
N-------
I  random_number = Random()                  /* Between 0 through 999 */
I  SAY "Default="random_number
I  min = random_number
I  max = min + 25
I  seed = max // 4
I  random_number = Random(min,max,seed)
I  SAY "min,max,seed="random_number
I  random_number = Random(1,10)
I  SAY "1,10="random_number
I  random_number1 = Random(1,6)                      /* Roll the dice */
I  random_number2 = Random(1,6)                      /* Roll the dice */
I  SAY "1.6="random_number1 "and" random_number2
I  random_number = Random(,,Date("S"))  /* Will be highly predicatble */
I  SAY "Date(s)="random_number
* End of WISH.
