NChapter 17. LIBRARY resources
N-----------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    LIBRARY(name)
I      The name of the LIBRARY resource.
N
I      For a LIBRARY resource that is defined in a CICS region, a CICSPlex
I      SM data repository, or a standalone CICS bundle, the resource name
I      is used as the DD name for the LIBRARY concatenation of data sets.
I      The name of the LIBRARY resource must therefore conform to the
I      rules for a valid DD name (1-8 characters with the first character
I      any of A-Z, $, # or @ and the remaining characters any of
I      A-Z, 1-9, $, # or @). Avoid using names that conflict with other
I      DD names used by the installation. The create of a public LIBRARY
I      resource fails if the chosen name conflicts with a DD name already
I      in use in the system for another public LIBRARY resource.
N
I      For a private LIBRARY resource that is defined in a CICS bundle
I      that is packaged and installed as part of an application bundle or
I      application binding bundle, the name of the LIBRARY resource is not
I      used as the DD name for the LIBRARY concatenation of data sets.
I      Instead, CICS requests a unique DD name for the LIBRARY
I      concatenation of data sets when the application is installed on the
I      platform. The resource name can therefore be the same as LIBRARY
I      names used elsewhere in the installation, or by different versions
I      of the application. CICS issues message DFHLD0518 to state the DD
I      name that z/OS has generated for the LIBRARY concatenation. You can
I      also view the data set names for an installed application in the
I      CICS Explorer.
N
I      The following reserved names are not accepted for a LIBRARY
I      resource:
N
I      -> DFHRPL or any name that starts with DFH
I      -> Any name that starts with EYU
I      -> CEEDUMP
I      -> DUMMY
I      -> JOBCAT
I      -> JOBLIB
I      -> STEPCAT
I      -> STEPLIB
I      -> SYSABEND
I      -> SYSIN
I      -> SYSMDUMP
I      -> SYSOUT
I      -> SYSUDUMP
N
I      LIBRARY resource names beginning with DFH or EYU are not accepted,
I      to ensure that these names remain available in future for use by
I      CICS. LIBRARY resource names beginning with CEE should be used with
I      caution, but are accepted. SYSIN and SYSOUT and DUMMY are
I      conventionally used as DD cards and are therefore inadvisable as
I      LIBRARY resource names. The remainder are DD names reserved by MVS;
I      DFHRPL is reserved for use in the CICS startup JCL as the name of
I      the static LIBRARY.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    CRITICAL(NO | YES)
I      Indicates whether this LIBRARY is critical to
I      the running of CICS. This determines the behavior if the LIBRARY
I      cannot be installed during startup, for example if a data set in
I      the LIBRARY definition is not found or cannot be allocated for one
I      of the following reasons:
N
I      -> If the LIBRARY is CRITICAL
N
I        -> If the LIBRARY is being created during CICS startup (through
I           grouplist install, BAS install, a PLTPI program or restore
I           from the catalog), a 'GO or CANCEL' message is issued so that
I           the operator can decide whether to override the criticality
I           and allow CICS to start, or to cause the startup to be failed.
I           If the reply is to continue with the startup, the LIBRARY is
I           not recataloged as NONCRITICAL, but the critical status can
I           be changed to NONCRITICAL if you decide that the LIBRARY is
I           not to be regarded as CRITICAL in future.
N
I        -> If the LIBRARY is not being created during CICS startup, the
I           criticality of the LIBRARY has no impact on the behavior of
I           the installation.
N
I      -> If the LIBRARY is non-CRITICAL
N
I        -> If the LIBRARY is being created during CICS startup (through
I           grouplist install, BAS install, a PLTPI program or restore
I           from the catalog), the LIBRARY is installed but disabled, a
I           warning message is issued, and CICS startup continues. A later
I           attempt can be made to resolve the problem and enable the
I           LIBRARY.
N
I        -> If the LIBRARY is not being installed during CICS startup,
I           the criticality of the LIBRARY has no impact on the behavior
I           of the installation.
N
I      DFHRPL, the static LIBRARY, is predefined as CRITICAL and cannot
I      be changed. Any problems cause CICS startup to fail and an error
I      message is issued.
N
I      For a private LIBRARY resource that is defined in a CICS bundle
I      that is packaged and installed as part of an application bundle
I      or application binding bundle, the CRITICAL attribute is ignored.
N
D    RANKING(50 | 1-9 | 11-99)
I      RANKING is a fullword binary value that contains a
I      decimal number that determines where this LIBRARY appears in the
I      overall LIBRARY search order.
N
I      A lower number indicates that this LIBRARY is searched for programs
I      to load before other LIBRARY resources with higher ranking numbers.
I      The ranking is analogous to the concatenation number of a data set
I      in a LIBRARY concatenation, although it has some differences.
N
I      RANKING can take values 1 - 99, with a default of 50. The value 10
I      is reserved for DFHRPL, the static LIBRARY, and cannot be
I      specified.
N
I      The DFHRPL concatenation is assigned a predefined ranking of 10,
I      which cannot be changed. This value enables dynamically defined
I      LIBRARY resources to be placed before the DFHRPL concatenation in
I      the overall search order by giving them a ranking value less
I      than 10.
N
I      Note:
I      -> You should regard having LIBRARY resources with a ranking that
I         places them before DFHRPL in the search order as a temporary
I         situation.
N
I      -> Although the predefined DFHRPL ranking of 10 is intended to
I         discourage the placing of LIBRARY resources before DFHRPL in
I         the search order, it does not limit the total number of LIBRARY
I         resources that can be placed before DFHRPL providing the ranking
I         between the LIBRARY resources themselves is not significant. If
I         you specify a RANKING value of less than 10, a message to say
I         that this LIBRARY appears ahead of DFHRPL in the search order
I         is issued.
N
I      -> No ranking change takes effect until a NEWCOPY or PHASEIN
I         request is issued, or the program is loaded for the first time
I         if it was not already loaded.
N
I      -> The search order of LIBRARYs with the same ranking is undefined,
I         and implies that the relative search order of the LIBRARY
I         resources is unimportant. In practice, the search order is the
I         order in which the LIBRARYs were installed.
N
I      -> A LIBRARY resource that is defined in a CICS bundle as part of
I         an application installed on a platform is private to that
I         version of that application. These LIBRARY concatenations are
I         only searched for tasks for that version of the application.
N
I      -> LIBRARYs can have the same ranking but you should not use equal
I         ranking values for two LIBRARY resources if their relative
I         search positions are of any significance.
N
I      -> The search positions of two LIBRARY resources of the same
I         ranking are not reliable. The search order is related to the
I         time each resource is installed, and can change after a COLD
I         or INITIAL start or when changing the ranking of a LIBRARY.
I         The resource that is installed first appears ahead of the other
I         LIBRARY in the search order.
N
D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Indicates whether the LIBRARY is to be
I      enabled or disabled when it is created.
N
I      When a LIBRARY is created as enabled, CICS attempts to allocate
I      and then concatenate the data sets, before finally opening the
I      LIBRARY concatenation. If any of these steps fail, the steps that
I      are already successful are undone, and the LIBRARY is installed as
I      disabled. A message is issued that indicates which step failed.
N
I      When a LIBRARY is created with as disabled, CICS does not attempt
I      to allocate or concatenate the data sets.
N
I      This attribute is ignored for LIBRARY resources that are
I      dynamically generated by a CICS bundle. The initial status of a
I      LIBRARY resource is derived from the initial status of the bundle
I      that defines the resource.

I      The names of up to 16 data sets that contain
I      program artifacts and that are to make up the LIBRARY
I      concatenation. When the LIBRARY is installed, the data sets are
I      concatenated together in the order in which they are named, for
I      example, DSNAME01 before DSNAME02. It is not necessary for all of
I      the data set attributes to be completed sequentially, for example,
I      DSNAME01 might be blank. However, at least one of the data set
I      attributes must have a value. See the CICS System Definition
I      Guide for further information.
