NAccess Method Services Tape Library Support
N-------------------------------------------
NAccess method services provides support for tape library functions.
NThe access method services ALTER, CREATE, and DELETE commands,
Nhowever, should be used only to recover from tape volume catalog
Nerrors. Because access method services cannot change the library
Nmanager inventory in an automated tape library, ISMF should be used
Nfor usual tape library ALTER, CREATE, and DELETE functions.
N
NSummary of Tape Library Support
N-------------------------------
NAccess method services supports the following tape library functions:
N
N-> Creating, altering, deleting, copying, and listing catalog entries
N   for tape library and tape volume entries
N
N-> Merging tape volume entries into other volume catalogs
N
N-> Providing support for functions that maintain an up-to-date tape
N   library inventory.
N
NThe CATALOG parameter is ignored when specified on any command that
Naffects a tape library entry except for the LISTCAT command.
N
NA tape library entry is the record for a tape library. A tape volume
Nentry is the record for a cartridge tape in a tape library.
