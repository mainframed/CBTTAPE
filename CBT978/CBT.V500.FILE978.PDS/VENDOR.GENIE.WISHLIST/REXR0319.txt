NRETURN
N------
NRETURN returns control (and possibly a result) from a REXX
Nprogram or internal routine to the point of its invocation.
I
IIf no internal routine is active, RETURN and EXIT are identical in
Itheir effect on the program that is being run.
M
MMessage from Kenneth Tomiak
MEXIT declares it leaves the program unconditionally. For that reason,
MKenneth uses RETURN to terminate non-EDIT macro code. For EDIT macro
Mcode, EXIT influences where the cursor is placed.
N
N
NSyntax:
D  RETURN expression
I    expression: A string resulting from evaluating expression.

I  SAY "You might include" tip "for the tip."
I  Result = tip
I  RETURN
I
Iyes_result:
