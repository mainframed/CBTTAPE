NChapter 17: AMATERSE
N--------------------
NPlanning for AMATERSE
N---------------------
NAMATERSE is an application that prepares diagnostic materials, such as
Nz/OS dumps and traces, for transmission to IBM and independent software
Nvendor sites. When the materials arrive, AMATERSE also provides a means
Nto create similar data sets to support diagnosis of problems.
N
NIf you have previously used the TRSMAIN utility (see
Nhttp://techsupport.services.ibm.com/390/trsmain.html), note the
Nfollowing changes made to prepare AMATERSE for formal inclusion
Nin z/OS:
N
N-> Use AMATERSE as the preferred application program name rather than
N   TRSMAIN. TRSMAIN ships as an alias entry point to AMATERSE.
N
N-> Use the replacements for the DDNAMES, which are SYSUT1 and SYSUT2.
N   When the TRSMAIN entry point of AMATERSE is invoked, DDNAMES INFILE
N   and OUTFILE remain as the defaults.
N
N-> AMATERSE is in MIGLIB, a library that is part of the link list. No
N   STEPLIB DDNAME is necessary to invoke AMATERSE.
N
N-> In nearly all cases, you can use AMATERSE, the TRSMAIN utility, and
N   VM terse interchangeably.
N
ISee "Restrictions for AMATERSE" for the exceptions to this rule.
