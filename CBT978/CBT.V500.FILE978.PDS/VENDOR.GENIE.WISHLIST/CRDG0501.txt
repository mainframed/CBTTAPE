NChapter 5. ATOMSERVICE resources
N--------------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    ATOMSERVICE(name)
I      Specifies the 8-character name of this resource
I      definition.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to eight characters in length.
I      Lowercase characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up
I      to 58 characters in length. There are no restrictions on the
I      characters that you can use. However, if you use parentheses,
I      ensure that for each left parenthesis there is a matching right
I      parenthesis. If you use the CREATE command, for each single
I      apostrophe in the text, code two apostrophes.
N
D    ATOMTYPE(FEED | COLLECTION | SERVICE | CATEGORY)
I      Specifies the type of Atom document that is returned
I      for this ATOMSERVICE definition.
N
I      FEED: An Atom feed document, which describes the metadata for a
I        feed, and contains Atom entries that provide data for the feed.
I        An Atom feed can be retrieved using HTTP GET requests, but it
I        cannot be edited by a Web client. The Atom configuration file
I        for an Atom feed must begin with the root element
I        <cics:atomservice type="feed">.
N
I      COLLECTION: An Atom collection document, which contains a group of
I        Atom entries that can be edited by Web clients using HTTP POST,
I        PUT, and DELETE requests, as well as being retrieved using
I        HTTP GET requests. The Atom configuration file for a collection
I        must begin with the root element
I        <cics:atomservice type="collection">.
N
I      SERVICE: An Atom service document, which provides information
I        about the editable collections that are available on a server.
N
I      CATEGORY: An Atom category document, which lists the categories for
I        entries in a collection. You can set up a category document if
I        you want to use the same categories to define multiple
I        collections.
N
D    CONFIGFILE(name)
I      Specifies the fully qualified (absolute) or
I      relative name of an Atom configuration file stored in z/OS UNIX
I      System Services. The Atom configuration file contains XML that
I      specifies metadata and field names for the Atom document that is
I      returned for this resource definition. For details, see the
I      CICS Internet Guide.
N
I      The name can be specified as an absolute path including all
I      directories and beginning with a slash, for example,
I      /u/atom/myfeed.xml. Alternatively, it can be specified as a path
I      relative to the HOME directory of the CICS region user ID, for
I      example, atom/myfeed.xml (with no leading forward slash). Up to
I      255 characters can be used.
N
D    BINDFILE(name)
I      Specifies the fully qualified (absolute) or
I      relative name of an XML binding stored in z/OS UNIX System
I      Services. This attribute is not used for an Atom service or
I      category document. You create an XML binding using the CICS XML
I      assistant program DFHLS2SC.
N
I      For resource types FILE and TSQUEUE, the XML binding is required,
I      and it specifies the data structures used by the resource named in
I      RESOURCENAME, which supplies the data for the Atom document.
N
I      For resource type PROGRAM, an XML binding is optional, and you
I      create it using the resource that the program accesses to obtain
I      the data for the Atom entries, not the program itself. You must
I      specify an XML binding for resource type PROGRAM if you are using
I      the resource handling parameters in the DFHATOMPARMS container to
I      pass information from the Atom configuration file to the program.
I      If you are not doing this, do not specify an XML binding.
N
I      The name of the XML binding can be specified as an absolute path
I      including all directories and beginning with a slash, for example,
I      /u/atom/atomictest.xsdbind. Alternatively, it can be specified as
I      a path relative to the HOME directory of the CICS region user ID;
I      for example, atom/atomictest.xsdbind (with no leading forward
I      slash). Up to 255 characters can be used.
N
D    RESOURCENAME(name)
I      Specifies the 1 - 16 character name of the CICS
I      resource that provides the data for this Atom feed or collection.
I      If the data for your Atom entries is held in a resource that is
I      accessed by a service routine, specify the name of the service
I      routine here. This attribute is not used for an Atom service or
I      category document.
N
D    RESOURCETYPE(FILE | PROGRAM | TSQUEUE)
I      Specifies the type of CICS
I      resource that holds the data for this Atom feed or collection.
I      This attribute is not used for an Atom service or category
I      document. TSQUEUE is the default for this attribute.
N
I      FILE: A CICS file. A single record in the file provides the data
I        for a single Atom entry. A file that holds Atom entries must have
I        a unique key for the records, and you cannot use an alternate
I        index file that has been defined with the NONUNIQUEKEY attribute.
I        You can use any type of VSAM file to hold Atom entries, but note
I        that ESDS (entry-sequenced data set) files are not suitable for
I        a feed that you might want to set up as an editable collection,
I        because you cannot delete records in an ESDS. You cannot use a
I        BDAM file.
N
I      PROGRAM: A service routine, which is a CICS application program
I        written to supply content for Atom entries.
N
I      TSQUEUE: A temporary storage queue. A single record in the
I        temporary storage queue provides the data for a single Atom
I        entry.
N
D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Indicates whether the Atom document specified by this
I      resource definition is available or unavailable.
