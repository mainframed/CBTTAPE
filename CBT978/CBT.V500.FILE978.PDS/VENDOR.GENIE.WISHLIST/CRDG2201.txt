NChapter 22. PARTNER resources
N-----------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    PARTNER(name)
I      Specifies the name of this PARTNER definition. The
I      name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      It is preferable not to use partner names that start with DFH
I      because these characters are reserved for use by CICS.
N
I      CICS can delete or discard them and replace them with CICS
I      resources when you upgrade or provide new function or fixes.
N
I      A partner definition specifies the SAA communications interface
I      information required to establish a conversation with a partner
I      program. For further guidance on this, see Common Programming
I      Interface Communications Reference.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    NETNAME(netname)
I      Specifies the netname of the logical unit on which the
I      partner application program is running. It matches the NETNAME
I      attribute specified in the CONNECTION definition. The name can be
I      up to eight characters in length.
N
D    NETWORK(network)
I      You can use this optional attribute to specify
I      the name of the network on which the partner LU is located. The
I      name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
D    PROFILE(DFHCICSA | profile)
I      Specifies the name of the PROFILE definition which
I      is to be used for the session and conversation. The default PROFILE
I      is DFHCICSA. The name can be up to 8 characters in length.
N
D    TPNAME(tpname)
I      Specifies the name of the remote transaction program
I      that will be running on the partner LU. The definition of a remote
I      TP name is mandatory; you must specify either TPNAME or its
I      alternative, XTPNAME. This name can be up to 64 characters in
I      length.
N
I      If this range of characters is not sufficient for a name that you
I      want to specify, you may use the XTPNAME attribute instead of
I      TPNAME.
N
D    XTPNAME(xtpname)
I      This attribute may be used as an alternative to
I      TPNAME; you must specify one of the two, because the definition
I      of a remote TP name is mandatory.
N
I      Enter a hexadecimal string up to 128 characters in length,
I      representing the name of the remote transaction program that runs
I      on the partner LU. All hexadecimal combinations are acceptable
I      except X'40'.
N
I      To specify an XTPNAME more than 72 characters long to DFHCSDUP,
I      put an asterisk in column 72. This causes the following line to
I      be concatenated.
* End of WISH.
