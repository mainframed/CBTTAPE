NChapter 34. TYPETERM resources
N------------------------------
NA TYPETERM resource defines a set of attributes that are common to a
Ngroup of terminals.
N
NThe resource is a logical extension of the TERMINAL resource. If you
Nhave a number of terminals with the same properties, you would define
None TYPETERM with the required values, and then name that TYPETERM in
Neach TERMINAL definition (or in the autoinstall model definition if you
Nare using autoinstall).
N
NEach TERMINAL definition must name a TYPETERM definition. This single
Nattribute represents many other characteristics, and thus can save
Nconsiderable effort, and reduce the chance of making mistakes.
NTYPETERMs make it easier to define your terminals if you have many
Nterminals of the same kind.
N
NTwo TYPETERM attributes are worthy of note here, because they further
Nsimplify the terminal definition process:
N
NDEVICE
N
NQUERY
