NExample 8: Build a New Copy Modification Module
N-----------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, a copy modification module that contains four
Nmodification segments is built. The module is added to the
NSYS1.IMAGELIB data set as a new member.

N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The COPY1 COPYMOD statement specifies text that applies to each page
N  of the first copy of the output data set: LINES=(1,1) and POS=50
N  specify that the text is to be on the first printable line of each
N  page, starting at the 50th print position from the left.
N
N  The TEXT parameter identifies each page of the copy as being the
N  "Controller's Copy".
N
N  The COPY2A COPYMOD statement specifies text that applies to each
N  page of the second copy of the output data set. The text is to be on
N  the first line of each page, at the 50th print position from the
N  left, with each page of the copy being the "Shipping Manager's
N  Copy".
N
N  The COPY2B COPYMOD statement specifies that part of the second
N  copy's output data set text is to be blanked out, so that the first,
N  third, and subsequent copies contain information that is not printed
N  on the second copy. The blank area is to be on lines 34, 35, and 36,
N  beginning at the 75th print position from the left. The text on
N  lines 34, 35, and 36, between print positions 75 and 84, is to be
N  blank (that is, the character specified between the TEXT parameter's
N  single quotation marks is a blank).
N
N  The COPYALL COPYMOD statement specifies text that applies to the
N  first four copies of the output data set. This example assumes that
N  no more than four copies are printed each time the job that produces
N  the output data set is processed. The text is to be on the 58th line
N  on each page, at the 35th print position from the left. The legend
N  "***CONFIDENTIAL***" is to be on each page of the copy. Note that
N  the text can be coded in both character and hexadecimal format.
N
N  The name of the copy modification module is RTO1; it is stored as a
N  member of the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
