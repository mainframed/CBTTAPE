NChapter 19: Dump suppression
N----------------------------
NUsing a SLIP command to suppress dumps
N--------------------------------------
NSome dumps are almost never needed. For example, some abend codes tell
Nthe diagnostician enough to solve the problem. For these codes, place
NSLIP operator commands in an IEASLPxx parmlib member to suppress the
Nunneeded dumps. The IBM-supplied IEASLP00 member contains the SLIP
Ncommands to suppress abend dumps that are seldom needed.
N
NTo suppress SVC dumps and ABEND SYSMDUMP dumps for abend code X'B37',
Nadd the following to IEASLPxx:
N
DSLIP SET,COMP=B37,ACTION=(NOSVCD,NOSYSM),END
* End of WISH.
