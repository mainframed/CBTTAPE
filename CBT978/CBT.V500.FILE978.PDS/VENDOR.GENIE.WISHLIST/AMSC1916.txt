NThe DEFINE USERCATALOG parameters are:
N--------------------------------------
N-> NAME: specifies the user catalog, USERCAT6.
N
N-> CYLINDERS: specifies that 3 cylinders are to be allocated for the
N   catalog. When the catalog is extended, it is in increments of
N   2 cylinders.
N
N-> MODEL: identifies USERCAT4 as the catalog to use as a model for
N   USERCAT6. The attributes and specifications of USERCAT4 that are
N   not otherwise specified with the above parameters are used to define
N   the attributes and specifications of USERCAT6. The master catalog,
N   AMAST1, contains a user-catalog connector entry that points to
N   USERCAT4. This is why USERCAT4 is specified as MODEL's catname
N   subparameter. Values and attributes that apply to USERCAT6 as a
N   result of using USERCAT4 as a model are:
N
N   -> CYLINDERS = 3 (primary) and 2 (secondary) are allocated to the
N      catalog
N   -> BUFFERSPACE = 3072 bytes
N   -> ATTEMPTS = 2
N   -> NOWRITECHECK
N   -> CODE is null
M      CODE cannot be coded anyway.
N   -> AUTHORIZATION is null
M      AUTHORIZATION cannot be coded anyway.
N   -> OWNER is null
N
N-> VOLUME: specifies that the user catalog is to reside on volume
N   VSER03.
