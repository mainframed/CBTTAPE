N=======================
NReceiving system trace data in a dump
N-------------------------------------
NSystem trace data that are requested by RTM and ABDUMPs will only
Nreceive the most current 64K of data for each CPU when the number of
Nconcurrent snapshots could affect system availability. This is referred
Nto as a mini-trace table snapshot.
N
NFor more information about working with system trace tables, see the
NSYSTRACE section in z/OS MVS IPCS Commands.
