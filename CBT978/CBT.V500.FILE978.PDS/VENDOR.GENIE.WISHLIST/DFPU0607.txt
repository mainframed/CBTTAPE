NExample 7: Edit and Copy a Sequential USS File to a Sequential Data Set
N-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example,a USS (POSIN  file is edited and copied. The logical
Nrecord length of the output data set is less than that of the input
Ndata set.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input file. Its name is
N  /dist3/stor44/sales.mon. It contains text in 100-byte records. The
N  record delimiter is not stated here. The file might be on a
N  non-System/390 system that is available via NFS, Network File
N  System.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output data set (NEWSET). Twenty tracks of
N  primary storage space and ten tracks of secondary storage space are
N  allocated for the data set on a disk volume. The logical record
N  length of the output records is 80 bytes, and the output is blocked.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  GENERATE indicates that a maximum of four FIELD parameters are
N  included in subsequent RECORD statements and that one IDENT
N  parameter appears in a subsequent RECORD statement.
N
N  EXITS identifies the user routine that handles input/output errors.
M
MKenneth whines, yet again, about the missing EXITS source and this
Mthe inability to run this example.
M
MEven more confusing in this day and age is what kind of I/O error
Mwould a normal user be trying to handle?
