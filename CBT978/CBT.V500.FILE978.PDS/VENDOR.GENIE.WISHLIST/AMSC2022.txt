NThe DELETE parameters are:
N--------------------------
N-> GDG01: is the entryname of the object being deleted. GDG01
N   identifies the generation data group base entry.
N
N-> RECOVERY: specifies that only the GDG base entry name in the
N   catalog is deleted. Its associated generation data sets remain
N   intact in the VTOC.
N
M   This makes the catalog and VTOC messy!
N
N-> GENERATIONDATAGROUP: specifies the type of entry being deleted. AMS
N   verifies that GDG01 is a generation data group entry, then deletes
N   it. If GDG01 incorrectly specifies another type of entry, AMS does
N   not delete the entry, but notes the discrepancy with a message to
N   the programmer.
