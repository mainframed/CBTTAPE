I      One to eight character name to identify a DB2
I      transaction definition.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource
I      that you are defining in this field. The description text can be
I      up to 58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the
I      characters that you can use. However, if you use parentheses,
I      ensure that for each left parenthesis there is a matching right
I      parenthesis. If you use the CREATE command, for each single
I      apostrophe in the text, code two apostrophes.
N
D    ENTRY(db2entry)
I      Specifies the name of the DB2 entry definition to
I      which this DB2 transaction definition refers. It is the DB2 entry
I      definition with which this additional transaction should be
I      associated.
N
D    TRANSID(transaction)
I      Specifies the transaction id to be associated
I      with the entry. If the TRANSID is not specified it defaults to the
I      first four characters of the DB2 transaction definition name. The
I      transaction id can include wildcard characters (* and +).
