NDD Statement
N============
NSPIN Parameter
N--------------
NUse the SPIN parameter to specify that the output for the SYSOUT
Ndata set is to be made available for processing:
N
N->Immediately upon unallocation; or
N->At the end of the job.
N
M         SEGMENT overrides SPIN=.
N
D//             SPIN= {NO } | {UNALLOC,cond}
I                 NO: Indicates that the system makes the sysout data
I                     set available for processing as a part of the
I                     output at the end of the job, regardless of when
I                     the data set is unallocated.
I                 UNALLOC: Indicates that the system makes the data set
I                          available for processing immediately when
I                          the data set is unallocated.
I                    cond: '{+}hh:mm' | nnnÝK|M¨} | NOCMND | CMNDONLY
I                          'hh:mm': Spin at specified time.
I                          '+hh:mm': Spin every interval.
I                          nnn: Spin every nnn (K|M) lines.
I                          NOCMND: Not by command, unallocate only.
I                          CMNDONLY: Spin only by command.
M                            If a JES2 command is issued requesting a
M                            spin operation:
M                            $TJnnn,SPIN or $TJnnn,SPIN,DD=ddname
M                            the data set is made available for printing
M                            immediately.
N
NExample 1: Be careful what you ask for.
N---------------------------------------
NIn this example, if you explicitly close or dynamically unallocate the
NSYSOUT data set, the system makes it available for printing
Nimmediately. If you do not explicitly close or dynamically unallocate
Nthe SYSOUT data set, the system makes it available for printing at the
Nend of the step. If a JES2 command is issued requesting a spin
Noperation ($TJnnn,SPIN or $TJnnn,SPIN,DD=ddname), the data set is made
Navailable for printing immediately.
N
D//DD1       DD SYSOUT=A,FREE=CLOSE,SPIN=UNALLOC
M
MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MWhile I am not able to test this example, the meaning of immediately
Msuggests a mid-page spin could take place. For that reason the
MSYSOUT where this might benefit the most is of long running tasks
Mspun at midnight to achieve a daily segment.
M
D//          DD SYSOUT=A,SPIN=(UNALLOC,'00:00')
N
NExample 5: Every 5,000 records (realistic or not).
N--------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, the system splits the data set into 5000 record
Nsegments and makes the SYSOUT data set available for printing every
N5000 records. Whatever remains in the data set at the end of the STEP
Nis available for printing at the end of step.
