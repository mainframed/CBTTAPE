NJES3 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL //*ROUTE XEQ Statement
N---------------------------
NUse the //*ROUTE XEQ statement to send the following input stream to a
Nnetwork node where the job is then executed. JES3 stops transmitting
Ninput stream records when it finds one of the following:
N
N->The second JOB statement after the //*ROUTE XEQ statement.
N->The input stream runs out of card images.
N
NAll output from the job is assumed to print/punch at the originating
Nnode unless otherwise specified on a DEST parameter.
N
NThe //*ROUTE XEQ statement must be given 80 character records.
N
D//*ROUTE XEQ nodenameÝ.vmguestid¨
I
I    nodename: Indicates the node. The nodename identifies an MVS JES2
I      system, an MVS JES3 (global) system, a VSE POWER node, or a VM system.
I
I      If nodename specifies a local node:
I      ->The job executes locally if the job begins with a JOB statement.
i      ->The job is terminated if the job begins with an NJE statement.
I
I    .vmguestid: Identifies a guest system running in a virtual machine
I      (VM), for example, an MVS system running under VM.
N
NExample 1: Route execution to Node 2.
N-------------------------------------
NIn this example, assume JOB statement JOBN1 is entered through the JES3
Nsystem at node 1. The //*ROUTE XEQ statement tells JES3 to send the
Nfollowing input stream to node 2. Transmission of the input stream is
Nstopped by the /* delimiter statement. JOB statement JOBN2 and all
Nfollowing statements until the delimiter are read and executed by the
Nsystem at node 2.
N
NSYSOUT is sent to several destinations, defaulting to the originating
Nnode when not specified (//DD3 goes to N1R33).
