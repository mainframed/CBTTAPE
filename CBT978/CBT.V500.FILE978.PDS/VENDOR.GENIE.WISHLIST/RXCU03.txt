NCompiler Options and Control Directives
N---------------------------------------
N    Compiler Options:
N    ALTERNATE  - specifies that at runtime the Alternate Library
N                 may be used.
N    BASE       - specify the base for constructing the default
N                 output data set names for CEXEC, DUMP, IEXEC,
N                 OBJECT, and PRINT output.
N    CEXEC      - specifies whether the Compiler is to produce a
N                 compiled EXEC.
N    COMPILE    - specifies whether the Compiler is to produce compiled
N                 code after all error checking has been performed.
N    CONDENSE   - specifies whether the generated output is to be
N                 condensed to take up less space.
N    DDNAMES    - allows you to perform the compilation step with
N                 alternate DDNAMES that are selected by the user.
N    DLINK      - specifies whether the OBJECT output is to contain
N                 references to external routines and functions.
N    DUMP       - provides diagnostic information for use by IBM
N                 support personnel asked for interphase dumps.
I                 Not likely!
N    FLAG       - (I,W,E,S,T) specifies the minimum severity of errors
N                 for which messages are to be issued.
N    FORMAT     - specifies that column numbers are to be included in
N                 the list of error messages and the cross-reference
N                 listing.
N    IEXEC      - generates an expanded output that contains the REXX
N                 source program and all members included by means of
N                 the %INCLUDE control directive.
M    LIBLEVEL   - specifies the version of the Library (minimum Library
M                 level) required to run the compiled program.
M                 OBSOLETE.
N    LINECOUNT  - specifies the maximum number of lines to be included
N                 on each page of the compiler listing.
N    MARGINS    - specifies the left and right margins of the REXX
N                 program.
M                 In case you use NUM ON.
N    OBJECT     - specifies whether the Compiler is to produce an
N                 object module.
M    OLDDATE    - (C,P,I,O) controls the creation date and time of the
M                 files that are generated by the Compiler ...
M                 under z/VM.
N    OPTIMIZE   - specifies whether the object code is to be optimized
N                 to reduce the amount of CPU time it requires at
N                 runtime.
N                 personnel askED for interphase dumps. Not likely!
N    FLAG       - (I,W,E,S,T) specifies the minimum severity of errors
N                 for which messages are to be issued.
N    FORMAT     - specifies that column numbers are to be included in
N                 the list of error messages and the cross-reference
N                 listing.
N    IEXEC      - generates an expanded output that contains the REXX
N                 source program and all members included by means of
N                 the %INCLUDE control directive.
M    LIBLEVEL   - specifies the version of the Library (minimum Library
M                 level) required to run the compiled program.
M                 OBSOLETE.
N    LINECOUNT  - specifies the maximum number of lines to be included
N                 on each page of the compiler listing.
N    MARGINS    - specifies the left and right margins of the REXX
N                 program.
M                 In case you use NUM ON.
N    OBJECT     - specifies whether the Compiler is to produce an
N                 object module.
M    OLDDATE    - (C,P,I,O) controls the creation date and time of the
M                 files that are generated by the Compiler ...
M                 under z/VM.
N    OPTIMIZE   - specifies whether the object code is to be optimized
N                 to reduce the amount of CPU time it requires at
N                 runtime.
N    PRINT      - specifies whether a compiler listing is to be
N                 created.
N    SAA        - specifies whether the Compiler is to check the source
N                 program for REXX language elements that are not part
N                 of level 4.02 of the SAA REXX interface.
N    SLINE      - specifies whether the Compiler is to include the
N                 source program in the compiled output and,
N                 consequently, support the SOURCELINE built-in
N                 function at runtime.
N                 If you require support for Alternate Libraries or
N                 full tracing, you should also set this option.
N    SOURCE     - specifies whether the compiler listing is to include
N                 a source listing.
N    TERMINAL   - specifies whether messages and the message summary
N                 are to be displayed/printed.
N    TESTHALT   - specifies whether the compiled program is to contain
N                 code that supports the halt condition.
N    TRACE      - specifies that the compiled program can be traced.
N    XREF       - specifies whether the compiler listing is to include
N                 a cross-reference listing.
N
NControl Directives:
N  A control directive always starts with /* and ends with */.
N  %COPYRIGHT - inserts a notice (for example a copyright notice) in
N               the form of a visible text string in the CEXEC, OBJECT
N               output, and core image of the compiled program.
N  %INCLUDE   - inserts, at compilation time, REXX code contained in
N               z/OS data sets or in CMS files into the REXX source
N               program.
N  %PAGE      - causes an unconditional skip to a new page in the
N               source listing.
N  %STUB      - simplifies link-editing under z/OS.
N  %SYSDATE   - inserts, at compilation time, code to create the
N               variable SYSDATE, which contains the compilation date.
N  %SYSTIME   - inserts, at compilation time, code to create the
N               variable SYSTIME, which contains the compilation time.
N  %TESTHALT  - inserts, at compilation time, code to support the
N               HALT condition.
N  * End of wish.
* End of WISH.
