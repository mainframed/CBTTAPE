NExample:
I  SAY "REXR0317"
I  SAY "--------"
I  SAY "PUSH adds to the stack in FILO/LIFO order."
I  SAY "PUSH puts the string on top and forces the rest of the"
I  SAY "stack down. In this way you would have to build a"
I  SAY "sequence of control cards in reverse order."
I  SAY ""
I  SAY "Use QUEUE to build them in the logical FIFO/LILO order."
I  SAY ""
I  DO ix = 9 TO 4 by -1
I    PUSH "Inverse records #"IX
I  END
I  PUSH "RECORD 2 ON THE DATA STACK. #3"
I  PUSH "Record 1 on the data stack. #2"
I  PUSH "PUSH  #3 BECOMES THE NEW RECORD 1 ON THE DATA STACK."
I  DO WHILE QUEUED() > 0
I    PARSE PULL data_record
I    SAY data_record
I  END
