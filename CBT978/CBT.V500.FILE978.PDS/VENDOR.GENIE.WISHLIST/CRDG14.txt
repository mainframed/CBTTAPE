NChapter 14. IPCONN resources
N----------------------------
NAn IPCONN resource defines a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
NProtocol (TCP/IP) communication link to a remote system. This
Ncommunication link is known as an IPIC connection.
N
NSome of the inbound attributes of the IPIC connection are specified
Nby the TCPIPSERVICE definition that is named on the TCPIPSERVICE option
Nof the IPCONN definition.
N
NThe REMOTESYSTEM name on a PROGRAM definition can refer to an IPCONN
Ndefinition through its IPCONN name. This attribute is used for
Ndistributed program link.
N
NFor guidance on defining IPCONN resources, see the
NCICS Intercommunication Guide (interestingly this has no IBM manual
Nnumber).
