NExample 22: Build a Library Character Set Module from Multiple Sources
N----------------------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, a library character set module is created. Its
Ncontents come from three different sources: 62 segments are copied from
Nan existing module with the INCLUDE statement; the CHARSET statement is
Nused to select another segment to be copied; a second CHARSET statement
Nis used to establish characteristics for a user-designed character. The
Nnew library character set module, when built, is added to the
NSYS1.IMAGELIB.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the library character
N  set module named 33 is to be included with the new module. All
N  segments of 33, except the third and fourth segments (as a result of
N  DELSEG=3,4), are to be copied into the new module and become the
N  basis for the new module.
N
N  The CHARSET statement specifies the module's third and fourth
N  segments:
N
N  REF=(1,02) and GCM=BODE specify that the third segment of the new
N  module is to be obtained by copying the first segment from the
N  graphic character modification module named BODE. The segment's
N  6-bit WCGM-location code is to be set so that its character is
N  identified with the code X'02'.
N
N  ASSIGN=03 specifies that the new module's fourth segment is a
N  user-designed character whose 6-bit WCGM-location code is X'03' and
N  whose width is 10-pitch (the default when no pitch value is
N  specified). The CHARSET statement is followed by data statements
N  that specify the character's scan pattern.
N
N  The name of the library character set module is 53, it is stored as
N  a new module in the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
