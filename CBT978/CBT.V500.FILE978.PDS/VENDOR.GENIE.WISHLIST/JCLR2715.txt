NJES2 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL /*OUTPUT Statement
N-----------------------
NUse the /*OUTPUT statement to specify characteristics and options for
None or more sysout data sets. This statement supplies processing
Noptions in addition to and in place of the options specified on the
Nsysout DD statement.
I
INote: You should use the OUTPUT JCL statement (// OUTPUT) instead of
Ithe JES2 /*OUTPUT statement because of the OUTPUT JCL statement's
Ienhanced output processing capabilities.
N
D/*OUTPUT {,parameter}...
I            {BURST| B} = {Y | N}
I              Indicates the default burst characteristic of all sysout
I                data sets that JES2 produces for this job. BURST
I                applies only when the data set is directed to a
I                3800 Printing Subsystem equipped with a
I                burster-trimmer-stacker.
I
I              Y: Requests that the 3800 output is to be burst into
I                separate sheets.
I              N: Requests that the 3800 output is to be in a
I                continuous fanfold.
I
I            {CHARS | X} = {,xxxx}
I              xxxx: Names a font for all output that JES2 prints on
I                an AFP printer in this job. The xxxx is 1 through 4
I                alphanumeric or national ($, #, @) characters. Code
I                one to four names.
I
I            {CKPTLNS | E}=nnnnn
I              nnnnn: Specifies the maximum number of lines or cards
I                contained in a logical page. The nnnnn is 1 through
I                5 decimal numbers from 0 through 32,767 for printers
I                and 1 through 32,767 for punches. The default is
I                specified in the JES2 initialization parameter for
I                the device.
I
I            {CKPTPGS | P}=nnnnn
I              nnnnn: Specifies the number of logical pages to be
I                printed before the next checkpoint is taken. The
I                nnnnn is 1 through 5 decimal numbers from 1 through
I                32,767. The default is specified in the JES2
I                initialization parameter for the device.
I
I            {COMPACT | Z}=xx
I              xx: Specifies a compaction table for JES2 to use when
I                sending this sysout data set, which must be a systems
I                network architecture (SNA) data set, to a
I                SNA remote terminal.
I
I            {COPIES | N}=(nnnÝ,(Ý,group-value¨)¨
I              Specifies how many copies of the sysout data set are to
I              be printed in page sequence order, or from an AFP
I              printer, grouped by page.
I
I              If you route a job that has a COPIES parameter, the
I              parameter will be used only if the receiving node is
I              a JES2 node.
I
I              nn: Specifies how many copies of the sysout data set are
I                to be printed; each copy will be in page sequence
I                order. The nnn is 1 through 3 decimal numbers from
I                1 through 255, subject to an installation-specified
I                limit. For a data set printed on an AFP printer, JES2
I                ignores nnn if any group values are specified.
I
I              group-value: Specifies how many copies of each page are
I                to be printed before the next page is printed. Each
I                group-value is 1 through 3 decimal numbers from
I                1 through 255. You can code a maximum of eight
I                group-values. Their sum must not exceed 255 or the
I                installation-specified limit. The total copies of
I                each page equals the sum of the group-values.
I
I                Note: This subparameter is valid only for output
I                processed by PSF.
I
I            {COPYG | G}=(Ý,group-value¨)
I              group-value: Specifies how many copies of each page are
I                to be printed before the next page is printed. Each
I                group-value is 1 through 3 decimal numbers from
I                1 through 255. You can code a maximum of eight
I                group-values. Their sum must not exceed 255. The
I                total copies of each page equals the sum of the
I                group-values.
I
I                Note: This parameter applies only for output processed
I                by PSF.
I
I            {DEST | D}=(Ý,destination¨)
I              destination: Specifies one to four different destinations
I                for the sysout data set. The destination subparameters
I                follow:
I
I                  ANYLOCAL | LOCAL: Indicates a local node on a local
I                    device.
I
I                  name: Identifies a local or remote device by a
I                    symbolic name.
I
I                  Nnnnn: nnnn is 1 through 4 decimal numbers from 1
I                    through 1000.
I
I                  NnnRmmmm | NnnnRmmm | NnnnnRmm: Identifies a node

I
I                  Unnnn: Identifies a local terminal with special
I                    routing.
I
I                  Userid: Identifies a userid at the local node.
I
I            {FCB | C}=xxxx
I              xxxx: Identifies the forms control buffer (FCB) image
I                JES2 is to use to guide printing of the sysout
I                data set. The xxxx is 1 through 4 alphanumeric or
I                national ($, #, @) characters and is the last
I                characters of a SYS1.IMAGELIB member name:
I
I                 ->FCB2xxxx member, for a 3211 Printer, a 3203 Printer
I                   Model 5, or a printer supported by systems network

I                 ->FCB4xxxx member, for a 4248 Printer.
I
I               IBM provides two standard FCB images. Code STD1 or STD2
I                 only to request them.
I
I                 ->STD1, which specifies 6 lines per inch on an
I                   8.5-inch-long form. (3211 and 3203-5 only)
I                 ->STD2, which specifies 6 lines per inch on an
I                   11-inch-long form. (3211 and 3203-5 only)
I
I            {FLASH | O}=(overlay-nameÝ,count¨) | NONE
I              Identifies the forms overlay to be used in printing the
I              sysout data set on a 3800 Printing Subsystem and,
I              optionally, specifies the number of copies on which the
I              forms overlay is to be printed.
I
I              overlay-name: Identifies the forms overlay frame that the
I                operator is to insert into the printer before printing
I                begins.
I
I              count: Specifies the number, 1 through 255, of copies that
I                JES2 is to flash with the overlay, beginning with the
I                first copy printed.
I
I              NONE: Suppresses flashing for this sysout data set.
I
I            {FLASHC | Q}=count
I              count: Specifies the number, 0 through 255, of copies
I                that JES2 is to flash with the overlay, beginning with
I                the first copy printed.
I
I            {FORMS | F} = {xxxx | STD}
I              Identifies the forms on which JES2 is to print or punch
I              the sysout data set.
I
I              xxxx: Identifies the print or punch forms. form-name is
I                1 through 4 alphanumeric or national ($, #, @)
I                characters.
I
I              STD: Indicates that JES2 is to use the default
I                specified at JES2 initialization.
I
I            {INDEX | I}=nn
I              nn: Sets the left margin for output on a 3211 Printer
I                with the indexing feature. The width of the print line
I                is reduced by the INDEX parameter value. The nn
I                specifies how many print positions the left margin on
I                the 3211 output is to be indented. nn is a decimal
I                number from 1 through 31. n=1 indicates flush-left;
I                n=2 through n=31 indent the print line by n-1
I                positions.
I
I              JES2 ignores the INDEX parameter if the printer is not a
I                3211 with the indexing feature.
I
I              Note: INDEX and LINDEX are mutually exclusive; if you
I                code both, JES2 uses the value you specified in INDEX.
I
I            {LINDEX | L}=nn
I              nn: Sets the right margin for output on a 3211 Printer
I                with the indexing feature. The width of the print
I                line is reduced by the LINDEX parameter value. The nn
I                specifies how many print positions the right margin
I                on 3211 output is to be moved in from the full page
I                width. nn is a decimal number from 1 through 31.
I                n=1 indicates flush-right; n=2 through n=31 move the
I                right margin over by n-1 positions.
I
I              JES2 ignores the LINDEX parameter on all printers except
I                the 3211 with the indexing feature.
I
I              Note: INDEX and LINDEX are mutually exclusive; if you
I                code both, JES2 uses the value you specified in INDEX.
I
I            {LINECT | K} = nnn
I              nnn: Specifies the maximum number of lines JES2 is to
I                print on each output page. The nnn is a number from
I                0 through 255.
I
I               Specify LINECT=0 to keep JES2 from starting a new page
I                when the number of lines exceeds the JES2
I                initialization parameter.
I
I            {MODIFY | Y} = (module-nameÝ,trc¨)
I              Specifies a copy-modification module that tells JES2 how
I              to print the sysout data set on a 3800 Printing
I              Subsystem. The module can specify legends, column
I              headings, blanks, and where and on which copies the data
I              is to be printed. The module is defined and stored in
I              SYS1.IMAGELIB using the IEBIMAGE utility program.
I
I              module-name: Identifies a copy-modification module in
I                SYS1.IMAGELIB. The module-name is 1 through 4
I                alphanumeric or national ($, #, @) characters.
I
I              trc: Identifies which table-name in the CHARS parameter
I                is to be used. This table reference character is 0 for
I                the first table-name specified, 1 for the second, 2
I                for the third, or 3 for the fourth.
I
I              If you do not specify trc, the default is 0. If the trc
I              value is greater than the number of table-names in the
I              CHARS parameter, JES2 uses the first table named in the
I              CHARS parameter.
I
I            {MODTRC | M} = trc
I              trc: Identifies which table-name in the CHARS parameter
I                is to be used. This table reference character is 0 for
I                the first table-name specified, 1 for the second, 2
I                for the third, or 3 for the fourth.
I
I              If you do not specify trc, the default is 0. If the trc
I              value is greater than the number of table-names in the
I              CHARS parameter, JES2 uses the first table named in the
I              CHARS parameter.
I
I            {UCS | T} = xxxx
I              xxxx: Identifies the universal character set (UCS) image
I                JES2 is to use in printing the sysout data set. The
I                xxxx is 1 through 4 alphanumeric or national ($, #, @)
I                characters. See OUTPUT Statement, JCLR2281, for IBM
I                standard special character set codes.
