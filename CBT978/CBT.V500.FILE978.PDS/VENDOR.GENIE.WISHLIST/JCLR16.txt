NEXEC Statement
N==============
NUse the EXEC (execute) statement to identify the program or cataloged
Nor in-stream procedure that this job step is to execute and to tell
Nthe system how to process the job step. The EXEC statement marks the
Nbeginning of each step in a job or a procedure.
I
IA job can have a maximum of 255 job steps. This maximum includes all
Isteps in any procedures the EXEC statements call.

D//Ýstepname¨ EXEC positional-parmÝ,keyword-parm¨...
D//               Ý,symbolic-parm=value¨... Ýcomments¨
N
NThe EXEC statement consists of the characters // in columns 1
Nand 2 and four fields:
N->name,
N->operation (EXEC),
N->parameter, and
N->comments.

MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MA half-word counter contains 256 values, 0 thru 255, thus the
M255 step limit. Realistically, no job with many steps is easy to
Msupport when it fails and you have to wade through all the muck
Mto find where it failed, why it failed, and how to RESTART the job.
M
MKeep It Smartly Simple (KISS)!

IIf you happen to have gotten the GENIE application off of a
Iphysical Tape or from an AWS format file of a physical tape then
Iyou discovered a rare case where more than 255 steps would be
Idesired. If you think outside of the box (half-word constraint)
Ithan you can come up with an alternate method of invoking more
Ithan 255 programs in a job. And what a nightmare that could be!
