NExample 7: Decipher Using System Keys
N-------------------------------------
NIn this example, the enciphered data set produced by the job in
NEncipher Using System Keys: Example 6 is deciphered, using a VSAM
Nrelative record data set as the target for the plaintext (deciphered)
Ndata. The empty slots in the original data set are reestablished. Keys
Nare managed by the Programmed Cryptographic Facility or the
NCryptographic Support Unit.

NThe JCL statements are:
N-----------------------
N-> CLEAR: describes the relative record data set.
N
N-> CRYPT: describes and allocates the magnetic tape containing the
N   enciphered data.
N
NThe REPRO parameters are:
N-------------------------
N-> INFILE: points to the CRYPT DD statement, identifying the tape
N   containing the enciphered source data.
N
N-> OUTFILE: points to the CLEAR DD statement, identifying the data set
N   to contain the deciphered data, RRDS2. The defined record size must
N   be the same as that of the original relative record data set.
N
N-> DECIPHER: indicates that the source data set is to be deciphered as
N   it is copied to the target data set.
N
N   -> SYSTEMKEY: indicates that keys are managed by the Program
N      Cryptographic Facility, the Cryptographic Unit Support, or the
N      z/OS Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility.
N
N   -> SYSTEMKEYNAME: supplies the key name, BKEY27, of the internal
N      file key that was used to encipher the system data encrypting
N      key. The file key must be an internal file key in this system.
