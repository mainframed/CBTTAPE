NChapter 4. Functions
N--------------------
NBuilt-in functions
N------------------
NSTORAGE
N-------
NSTORAGE returns length bytes of data from the specified address in
Nstorage. The address is a character string containing the hexadecimal
Nrepresentation of the storage address from which data is retrieved.
N
N
NA very dangerous instruction because it will lead you to
Nfollow control blocks instead of using 'supported' methods. And
Nwhen a vendor changes the control blocks, your code fails.
NSometimes, as happened with UCBs, access via control blocks is
Ntotally removed and you are left scrambling for a new solution.
N
N
MHow can you change data? Use an assembler program to GETMAIN some
Mstorage and pass you the address of where it is.
N
N
NSyntax:
D  storage_value = Storage(hex_addr,length,new_value)
I    hex_addr: The storage address you want to reference.
N
I    length:   How much storage to retrieve.
N
I    new_value: For your storage only, a new value.
N
N
NExample
N-------
I  cvt_ptr = Storage(00000010,4)
I  SAY "The cvt pointer refers to address:" C2X(cvt_ptr)"."
