NChapter 9. DB2ENTRY resources
N-----------------------------
NA DB2ENTRY defines the attributes of entry threads used by the CICS
NDB2/attachment facility.
N
NA transaction, or a group of transactions, can be associated with the
NDB2ENTRY; a group of transactions may be represented by the use of one
Nor more wildcard characters (* and +). Also, further transactions can
Nbe associated with a DB2ENTRY by defining a DB2TRAN.
N
NInstalling DB2 entry definitions
N--------------------------------
NThis section describes the guidelines for installing and discarding
NDB2ENTRY definitions and the implications of interruptions in partial
Nactivity.
N
NAbout this task
N---------------
N-> You can install a DB2ENTRY only if you have previously installed a
N   DB2CONN.
N
N-> You can install a new DB2ENTRY at any time, even when the CICS DB2
N   adapter is connected to DB2.
N
N-> You can reinstall (by replacing an existing DB2ENTRY) only when the
N   DB2ENTRY is disabled and no transaction is using it. Use the
N   SET DB2ENTRY DISABLED command to quiesce activity and disable the
N   entry. New transactions trying to use the DB2ENTRY are routed to the
N   pool, abended, or returned an SQLCODE, dependent on the setting of
N   the DISABLEDACT keyword when the DB2ENTRY is disabled.
N
N-> You can discard a DB2ENTRY only if it is disabled. Use the
N   SET DB2ENTRY DISABLED command to quiesce activity and disable the
N   entry. New transactions trying to use the DB2ENTRY are routed to the
N   pool, abended, or returned an SQLCODE, dependent on the setting of
N   the DISABLEDACT keyword when the DB2ENTRY is disabled.
N
N   If you discard a DB2ENTRY, you could make the corresponding DB2TRAN
N   an 'orphan'. If you then run a transaction, a message is sent to the
N   CDB2 transient data destination, and the request is rerouted to the
N   pool.
