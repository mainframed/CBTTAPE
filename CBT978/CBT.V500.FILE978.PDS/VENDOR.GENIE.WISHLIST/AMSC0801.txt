NSyntax for BLDINDEX Parameters
N------------------------------
D  BLDINDEX -
N
NRequired parameters
N-------------------
D    INFILE(ddname) | /* Abbreviation: IFILE */ -
D    INDATASET(entryname) /* Abbreviation: IDS */ -
I      names the DD statement or data set that identifies the base
I      cluster or a path that points to the base cluster.
N
I      INFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: IFILE */: is the DD statement
I        that identifies the base cluster or a path that points to the
I        base cluster. You must define the base cluster in the same
I        catalog as the alternate index, and it must contain at least
I        one data record.
N
I      INDATASET(entryname) /* Abbreviation: IDS */: names the data set
I        that identifies the base cluster or a path that points to the
I        base cluster. You must define the base cluster in the same
I        catalog as the alternate index, and it must contain at least
I        one data record. When you use INDATASET to dynamically
I        allocate the base-cluster volume, make sure the base-cluster
I        volume is mounted as permanently resident or reserved.
N
D    OUTFILE(ddname ddname) | /* Abbreviation: OFILE */ -
D    OUTDATASET(entryname entryname) /* Abbreviation: ODS */ -
I      names the DD statement or data set that identifies the alternate
I      index or a path that points to the alternate index. If the data
I      set has previously been deleted and redefined in this same
I      invocation of IDCAMS and the FILE parameter was specified on the
I      delete, you must specify the OUTDATASET keyword instead of
I      OUTFILE to avoid picking up incorrect volume information from the
I      original DD statement. Alternately, you may issue the BLDINDEX
I      in a different step than the step that did the delete and define.
I      You can build more than one alternate index for the same base
I      cluster by using more than one ddname or data set name with the
I      OUTFILE or OUTDATASET parameter.
N
I      OUTFILE(ddname ddname...) /* Abbreviation: OFILE */: indicates
I        the DD statement that identifies the alternate index, or a
I        path that points to the alternate index. You must define the
I        alternate index in the same catalog as the base cluster, and
I        it must be empty (that is, its high-used relative byte address
I        equals zero) or defined with the REUSE attribute.
N
I        The alternate index must be related to the base cluster
I        identified with INDATASET or INFILE.
N
I      OUTDATASET(entryname entryname...) /* Abbreviation: ODS */:
I        specifies the data set that identifies the alternate index or
I        a path that points to the alternate index. When you define the
I        alternate index in the same catalog as the base cluster, it
I        must be empty (that is, its high-used RBA equals zero) or must
I        be defined with the REUSE attribute.
N
I        The alternate index must be related to the base cluster
I        identified with INDATASET or INFILE.
N
I        When you use OUTDATASET, to dynamically allocate the alternate
I        index's volume, make sure the volume is mounted as permanently
I        resident or reserved.
N
NOptional parameters
N-------------------
D    EXTERNALSORT | INTERNALSORT -
I      decides whether the key-pointer pairs are to be sorted entirely
I      within virtual storage.
N
I      EXTERNALSORT /* Abbreviation: ESORT */: specifies that two
I        external-sort work files are defined and built as
I        entry-sequenced clusters. You must provide two DD statements
I        that describe the external-sort work files to be defined by
I        BLDINDEX. You can name the DD statements IDCUT1 and IDCUT2.
I        When you choose other names for the work file DD statements,
I        you must identify those DD statements with the WORKFILES
I        parameter.
N
I      INTERNALSORT /* Abbreviation: ISORT*/: requires access method
I        services to sort the key-pointer pairs entirely within the
I        user-provided virtual storage, if possible. If you do not
I        have enough virtual storage available when you use
I        INTERNALSORT, two external-sort work files are built and the
I        key-pointer pairs are sorted externally. You must provide DD
I        statements as for EXTERNALSORT. If the minimum amount of
I        virtual storage is not provided the BLDINDEX processing ends
I        with an error message. See z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets for
I        more information about alternate indexes.
N
D    SORTCALL | NOSORTCALL -
I      use this parameter to choose whether or not to call DFSORT to
I      sort the alternate index.
N
I      SORTCALL: specifies that you want DFSORT to sort the alternate
I        index. EXTERNALSORT, INTERNALSORT, WORKFILES, CATALOG, IDCUT1,
I        and IDCUT2 are ignored when DFSORT is called. If DFSORT is not
I        available, BLDINDEX uses the IDCAMS internal sort.
I        SORTCALL is the default.
N
I      NOSORTCALL: tells BLDINDEX to use the IDCAMS internal sort (or
I        external sort if specified) instead of DFSORT to sort the
I        alternate index. When the IDCAMS internal or external sort is
I        used, SORTMESSAGELEVEL, SORTDEVICETYPE, SORTMESSAGEDD and
I        SORTFILENUMBER specifications are prohibited.
N
D    SORTDEVICETYPE(device type) /* Abbreviations: SORTDVT SDVT */ -
I      specifies the DASD device type passed to DFSORT in the DYNALLOC
I      parameter in the OPTION control statement. Use this parameter
I      only if you wish to override the default device type for DFSORT
I      work data sets. See z/OS DFSORT Application Programming Guide
I      for further details on the DYNALLOC parameter. This parameter is
I      not allowed if you use NOSORTCALL.
N
D    SORTFILENUMBER(number) /* Abbreviations: SORTFN | SFN */ -
I      Specifies the maximum number of work data sets passed to DFSORT
I      in the DYNALLOC parameter in the OPTION control statement. Use
I      this parameter to override the number of work data sets that
I      BLDINDEX determines are needed. See z/OS DFSORT Application
I      Programming Guide for further details on the DYNALLOC parameter.
I      This parameter is not allowed if you use NOSORTCALL.
N
D    SORTMESSAGEDD(ddname) /* Abbreviations: SORTMDD | SMDD */ -
I      Specifies the ddname that describes the DFSORT message data set.
I      If there is no DD statement for this ddname, a message data set
I      with this ddname is allocated dynamically as a SYSOUT=* data set.
I      SYSOUT is the default for ddname. Do not use any ddname reserved
I      for use by IDCAMS (SYSPRINT or SYSIN) or DFSORT. See z/OS DFSORT
I      Application Programming Guide for a list of reserved ddnames.
I      This parameter is not allowed if you use NOSORTCALL or
I      SORTMESSAGELEVEL (NONE).
N
D    SORTMESSAGELEVEL( /* Abbreviations: SORTML | SML */ -
D     ALL | CRITICAL | NONE -
D    ) -
I      Specifies the level of DFSORT messages to print to the DFSORT
I      message data set. You cannot use this parameter with NOSORTCALL.
N
I      ALL: Requires that all DFSORT messages and control statements
I        are printed tothe message data set.
N
I      CRITICAL: Allows only critical DFSORT messages to print to the
I        message data set. No DFSORT control statements are printed.
I        Critical is the default.
N
I      NONE: Allows no DFSORT messages or control statements to print
I        to the message data set.
N
D    WORKFILES(ddname ddname...) /* Abbreviation: WFILE */ /* - */
I      Specifies the DD statements that describe the name and placement
I      of the work files you want BLDINDEX to define if you require an
I      external sort of the key-pointer pairs. See the CATALOG parameter
I      for further description of where the work files are defined. You
I      can use DD statements to describe two work files that are defined
I      and opened before the BLDINDEX routine begins processing the
I      base-cluster's data records.
N
I      Exception: Do not use tape data sets as work data sets.
N
I      If one of the data sets is SMS-managed, the other must either be
I      SMS-managed or a non-SMS-managed data set cataloged in the
I      catalog determined by the catalog search order.
N
I      When you code the DD statements that describe the work files and
I      identify them with the standard ddnames IDCUT1 and IDCUT2, you do
I      not need to use the WORKFILES parameter.
N
M    CATALOG(catname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      names the catalog in which the work files are to be defined. The
I      work files are defined and used by the BLDINDEX routine. When all
I      alternate indexes are built and the BLDINDEX routine no longer
I      needs the work files, they are deleted. Search "Catalog Selection
I      Order for BLDINDEX" for more information.
N
I      To use catalog names for SMS-managed data sets, you must have
I      access to the RACF STGADMIN.IGG.DIRCAT FACILITY class. Search
I      "Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) Considerations" for more
I      information.
