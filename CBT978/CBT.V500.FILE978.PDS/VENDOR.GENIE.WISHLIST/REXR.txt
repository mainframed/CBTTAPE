Nz/OS TSO/E REXX Reference
N=========================
NThe REstructured eXtended eXecutor (REXX) language is particularly
Nsuitable for:
N
N-> Command procedures
N
N-> Application front ends
N
N-> User-defined macros (such as editor subcommands)
N
N-> Prototyping
N
N-> Personal computing. Individual users can write programs for their
N   own needs.

NChapter 3. Keyword instructions
N-------------------------------
N ADDRESS:   temporarily or permanently changes the destination of
N            commands.
N ARG:       retrieves the argument strings provided to a program or
N            internal routine and assigns them to variables.
N CALL:      calls a routine (if you specify name) or controls the
N            trapping of certain conditions (if you specify ON or OFF).
N DO:        groups instructions together and optionally processes them
N            repetitively.
N DROP:      'unassigns' variables, that is, restores them to their
N            original uninitialized state.
N EXIT:      leaves a program unconditionally.
N IF:        conditionally processes an instruction or group of
N            instructions depending on the evaluation of the
N            expression.
N INTERPRET: processes instructions that have been built dynamically
N            by evaluating expression.
N ITERATE:   alters the flow within a repetitive DO loop (that is, any
N            DO construct other than that with a simple DO).
N LEAVE:     causes an immediate exit from one or more repetitive DO
N            loops (that is, any DO construct other than a simple DO).
N NOP:       is a dummy instruction that has no effect.
N NUMERIC:   changes the way in which a program carries out arithmetic
N            operations.
N OPTIONS:   passes special requests or parameters to the language
N            processor.
N PARSE:     assigns data (from various sources) to one or more
N            variables according to the rules of parsing
N PROCEDURE: within an internal routine (subroutine or function),
N            protects variables by making them unknown to the
N            instructions that fall outside of it.
N PULL:      reads a string from the head of the external data queue.
N PUSH:      stacks the string resulting from the evaluation of
N            expression at the head of the external data queue. That is,
N            it is added FIFO (First In, First Out) onto the external
N            data queue.
N QUEUE:     appends the string resulting from expression to the tail
N            of the external data queue. That is, it is added
N            LILO (Last In, Last Out).
N RETURN:    returns control (and possibly a result) from a REXX
N            program or internal routine to the point of its
N            invocation.
N SAY:       writes a line to the output stream.
N SELECT:    conditionally calls one of several alternative
N            instructions.
N SIGNAL:    causes an unusual change in the flow of control (if you
N            specify labelname or VALUE expression), or controls the
N            trapping of certain conditions (if you specify ON or OFF).
N TRACE:     controls the tracing action (that is, how much is
N            displayed to the user) during processing of a REXX
N            program.
N UPPER:     translates the contents of one or more variables to
N            uppercase.

N                to halt the execution of a REXX exec.
N    HI:         (Halt Interpretation) is an immediate command you can
N                use to halt the interpretation of all currently
N                executing execs.
N    HT:         (Halt Typing) is an immediate command you can use to
N                suppress terminal output that an exec generates.
N    RT:         (Resume Typing) is an immediate command you can use to
N                resume terminal output that was previously suppressed.
N    TE:         (Trace End) is an immediate command you can use to end
N                tracing REXX execs.
N    TS:         (Trace Start) is an immediate command you can use to
N                start tracing REXX execs.

N  Function descriptions
N  ---------------------
N    DBadjust:    In EBCDIC, adjusts all contiguous SI and SO (or SO
N                 and SI) characters in string based on the operation
N                 specified.
N    DBbracket:   In EBCDIC, adds SO and SI brackets to a DBCS-only
N                 string.
N    DBcenter:    returns a string of length length with string
N                 centered in it, with pad characters added as
N                 necessary to make up length.
N    DBCjustify:  formats string by adding pad characters between
N                 nonblank characters to justify to both margins and
N                 length of bytes length (length must be nonnegative).
N    DBleft:      returns a string of length length containing the
N                 leftmost length characters of string.
N    DBright:     returns a string of length length containing the
N                 rightmost length characters of string.
N    DBrleft:     returns the remainder from the DBLEFT function of
N                 string.
N    DBrright:    returns the remainder from the DBRIGHT function of
N                 string.
N    DBtodbcs:    converts all passed, valid SBCS characters (including
N                 the SBCS blank) within string to the corresponding
N                 DBCS equivalents.
N    DBtosbcs:    converts all passed, valid DBCS characters (including
N                 the DBCS blank) within string to the corresponding
N                 SBCS equivalents.
N    DBunbracket: In EBCDIC, removes the SO and SI brackets from a
N                 DBCS-only string enclosed by SO and SI brackets.
N    DBvalidate:  returns 1 if the string is a valid mixed string or
N                 SBCS string.
N    DBwidth:     returns the length of string in bytes.
