NThe DEFINE ALTERNATEINDEX parameters are:
N-----------------------------------------
N-> NAME: indicates that the alternate index's name is EXMP2.AIX.
N
N-> RELATE: identifies the alternate index base cluster, EXAMPLE.SMS2.
N   Because an SMS-managed alternate index is being defined, the base
N   cluster must also be SMS-managed.
N
N-> CYLINDERS: allocates three cylinders for the alternate index's
N   space. The alternate index is extended in increments of one
N   cylinder.
N
N-> KEYS: specifies the length and location of the alternate key field
N   in each of the base cluster's data records. The alternate key field
N   is the first three bytes of each data record.
N
N-> RECORDSIZE: specifies that the alternate index's records are
N   variable length, with an average size of 40 bytes and a maximum
N   size of 50 bytes.
N
N-> NONUNIQUEKEY: specifies that the alternate key value might be the
N   same for two or more data records in the base cluster.
N
N-> UPGRADE: specifies that the alternate index is to be opened by VSAM
N   and upgraded each time the base cluster is opened for processing.
N
N-> VOLUMES: indicates that the alternate index is to reside on volume
N   VSER01. This example assumes that the volume is already cataloged
N   in the user catalog, USERCAT.
N
N-> CATALOG: defines the alternate index in the user catalog, USERCAT.
M   The ALIAS 'EXAMPLE' must relate to user catalog USERCAT.
M   Kenneth Tomiak recommends NEVER coding the CATALOG parameter for
M   application data sets.
