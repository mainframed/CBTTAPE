NChapter 2. Description of the ISPF services
N-------------------------------------------
NADDPOP-Start pop-up window mode
N-------------------------------
NThe ADDPOP service notifies the dialog manager that all subsequent
Mpanel displays are to appear in a pop-up window. No visible results
Mappear on the screen until you issue a DISPLAY, TBDISPL, or
MSELECT PANEL call.
N
NAll subsequent panel displays will be in the pop-up window created with
Mthe ADDPOP call, until a REMPOP or another ADDPOP is called. Another
MADDPOP call creates a separate pop-up window.
N
NEach pop-up window created as a result of a successful ADDPOP service
Ncall can also have a window title. The title is embedded in the top of
Nthe window frame border and can be only one line length. If the title
Nis longer than the window frame, the dialog manager truncates it. To
Ndefine the window title, set system variable ZWINTTL to the desired
Nwindow title text.
N
NCommand invocation format
N-------------------------
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "ADDPOP" ,
D    "POPLOC("poploc")" ,
I      Specifies that the dialog manager is to position the
I      pop-up window relative to the specified field in the currently
I      displayed panel. If omitted, the pop-up window is offset
I      positioned relative to the active window.
N
D    "ROW("row"")" ,
I      Specifies that the dialog manager is to adjust the field-specific
I      location row or offset location row by the specified amount. This
I      amount can be either positive or negative.
I      The default value is 0.
N
D    "COLUMN("column")"
I      Specifies that the dialog manager is to adjust the
I      field-specific location column or offset location column by the
I      specified amount. This amount can be positive or negative.
I      The default value is 0.
N
NParameters
N----------
NThe poploc, row, and column parameters are optional.
N
Note: When running in GUI mode, the poploc, row, and column
N     parameters are ignored.
N
NIf you omit the poploc parameter when using the ADDPOP service, the
NDialog Manager offset positions the pop-up window so that the title of
Nthe underlying panel is visible, and horizontally four character spaces
Nto the right of the underlying panel.
N
NIf the pop-up window will not fit relative to the ADDPOP positioning
Nparameters, the Dialog Manager overrides these parameters and adjusts
Nthe window so that it fits on the screen.
N
NReturn codes
N------------
NThese return codes are possible:
N
D  addpop_rc = RC
D  SELECT
D    WHEN (addpop_rc = 0) THEN DO
D      /* Normal completion. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (addpop_rc = 12) THEN DO
D      /* An ADDPOP service call was issued before a panel was
D         displayed or another ADDPOP service call was issued before a
D         panel was displayed for the previous ADDPOP call. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the logic."
D    END
D    WHEN (addpop_rc = 20) THEN DO
D      /* Severe error. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the logic."
D    END
D    OTHERWISE DO
D      SAY "Something very unexpected happened, RC("browse_rc")."
D    END
D  END
