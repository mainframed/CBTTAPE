N-----------------------------------------
NExample 4: Unload and Compress a Data Set
N-----------------------------------------
NIn this example, a partitioned data set is unloaded to a tape volume to
Ncreate a backup copy of the data set. If this step is successful, the
Npartitioned data set is to be compressed in place.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines a partitioned data set (PARTPDS) that resides on
N  a disk volume and is assumed to have 700 members. The number of
N  members is used to calculate the space allocation on SYSUT3.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines a sequential data set to hold PARTPDS in unloaded
N  form. Block size information can optionally be added; this data set
N  must be NEW.
N
N  SYSUT3 DD defines the temporary spill data set. The SYSUT4 data set
N  is never used for an unload operation.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set. Because SYSIN is dummied and
N  SYSUT2 defines a sequential data set, all members of the SYSUT1 data
N  set will be unloaded to the SYSUT2 data set.
N
N  The second EXEC statement marks the beginning of the
N  compress-in-place operation. The SIZE parameter indicates that the
N  buffers are to be as large as possible. The COND parameter indicates
N  that the compress-in-place is to be performed only if the unload
N  operation was successful.
N
N  COMPDS DD defines a partitioned data set (PARTPDS) that contains 700
N  members and resides on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSUT3 DD defines the temporary spill data set to be used if there
N  is not enough space in main storage for the input data set's
N  directory entries. TEMPA contains one 80-character record for each
N  member.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. The data set contains a COPY statement.
N
N  COPY marks the beginning of the copy operation. Because the same DD
N  statement is specified for both the INDD and OUTDD operands, the
N  data set is compressed in place. If a PDSE is being used, this step
N  will not be processed.
M
MIf you want to unload more than one data set in a single use of
MIEBCOPY, you must use a separate COPY statement for each unload
Moperation. Only one input data set may be specified in an unload
Moperation.
