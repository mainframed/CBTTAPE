NFORMAT
N------
NFORMAT returns number, rounded and formatted.
N
N
NSyntax:
D  Format(number,before,after,expp,expt)
I    number: The number is first rounded according to standard REXX
I            rules, just as though the operation number+0 had been
I            carried out. The result is precisely that of this operation
I            if you specify only number.
N
I    before,after: The before and after options describe how many
I                  characters are used for the integer and decimal
I                  parts of the result, respectively. If you omit
I                  either or both of these, the number of characters
I                  used for that part is as needed.
N
I                  If before is not large enough to contain the integer
I                  part of the number (plus the sign for a negative
I                  number), an error results. If before is larger than
I                  needed for that part, the number is padded on the
I                  left with blanks. If after is not the same size as
I                  the decimal part of the number, the number is rounded
I                  (or extended with zeros) to fit.
N
I                  Specifying 0 causes the number to be rounded to an
I                  integer.
N
I    expp,expt: In addition, expp and expt control the exponent part of
I               the result, which, by default, is formatted according
I               to the current NUMERIC settings of DIGITS and FORM. The
I               expp sets the number of places for the exponent part;
I               the default is to use as many as needed (which may be
I               zero). The expt sets the trigger point for use of
I               exponential notation. The default is the current setting
I               of NUMERIC DIGITS.

NExample
N-------
I  SAY "Loosely format a numeric field."
I  formatted_number = Format(unformatted_number,before,after,expp,expt)
I/* 1st it rounds = (unformatted_number + 0)                          */
I/* 2nd it formats based on before and after                          */
I/* 3rd it formats the result based on NUMERIC, DIGITS, and FORM      */
I/*   expp = positions for decimal in exponential notation            */
I/*   expt = trigger for exponential notation                         */
I
I  unformatted_number = -0012.730
I  formatted_number = Format(unformatted_number,4,2,,2)
I  Say unformatted_number "becomes" formatted_number"."
I
I  Say  "'3',4            =" FORMAT('3',4)            "-> '    3'"
I  Say  "'1.73',4,0       =" FORMAT('1.73',4,0)       "-> '    2'"
I  Say  "'1.73',4,3       =" FORMAT('1.73',4,3)       "-> '    1.730'"
I  Say  "'-.76',4,1       =" FORMAT('-.76',4,1)       "-> '   -0.8'"
I  Say  "'3.03',4         =" FORMAT('3.03',4)         "-> '    3.03'"
I  Say  "' - 12.73'       =" FORMAT(' - 12.73')       "-> ' -12.73'"
I  Say  "' - 12.73',,4    =" FORMAT(' - 12.73',,4)    "-> ' -12.7300'"
I  Say  "'0.000'          =" FORMAT('0.000')          "-> '0'"
I  Say  "'0.000',2        =" FORMAT('0.000',2)        "-> '0'"
I  Say  "'0.000',,2       =" FORMAT('0.000',,2)       "-> '0.00'"
I  Say  "'12345.73',,,2,2 =" FORMAT('12345.73',,,2,2) "-> '1.234573E+04'"
I  Say  "'12345.73',,3,,0 =" FORMAT('12345.73',,3,,0) "-> '1.235E+4'"
I  Say  "'1.234573',,3,,0 =" FORMAT('1.234573',,3,,0) "-> '1.235'"
I  Say  "'12345.73',,,3,6 =" FORMAT('12345.73',,,3,6) "-> '12345.73'"
I  Say  "'1234567e5',,3,0 =" FORMAT('1234567e5',,3,0) "-> '123456700000.000'"
