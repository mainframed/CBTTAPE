NChapter 1. Using Access Method Services
N---------------------------------------
NAccess method services (AMS) is a utility you can use to establish
Nand maintain catalogs and data sets. The Storage Management Subsystem
N(SMS) and its classes, in conjunction with the automatic class
Nselection (ACS) routines, automate many access method services
Ncommands and their specified parameters. However, if your storage
Nadministrator has not established these routines, you can construct
Nand execute them manually. You can find these commands and parameters
Nin this book.
N
NIDCAMS is the program name for access method services (AMS).
N
NThere are two types of access method services commands: Functional
Ncommands, which you use to define data sets or list catalogs; and
Nmodal commands, which you use to specify the conditional execution
Nof functional commands. If you are a time sharing option (TSO/E) user,
Nyou are restricted to using only the functional commands. For detailed
Ninformation about these commands, their parameters and subparameters,
Nrefer to the subsequent chapters in this book.
