NXMIT Statement
N==============
NUse the XMIT JCL statement to transmit records from an MVS node to a
NJES3 node, a JES2 node, a VSE/POWER node, a VM/RSCS node, or an
NOS/400 node.
N
D//Ýname¨  XMIT Ý,parameter¨... Ýcomments¨
I                 parameter: The XMIT JCL statement contains only
I                   keyword parameters. A DEST parameter is
I                   required; the DLM and SUBCHARS parameters are
I                   optional.
I
I                   JES3: If your JCL is to be processed by an
I                   internal reader and /*EOF or /*DEL is part of the
I                   XMIT JCL stream, you must code the SUBCHARS
I                   parameter and convert /* in your statements.
I
I                   DEST=: Identifies the destination for all following
I                     records until a delimiter stops transmission of
I                     THE records.
I
I                   DLM=cc: cc: Specifies a delimiter to stop the
I                     transmission of records.
I
I                   SUBCHARS=cc: cc: Specifies a substitute for internal
I                     reader control statements. (JES3 only).

NExample 1: Simple transmission.
N-------------------------------
NIn this example, the records between the XMIT JCL statement and the
Ndelimiter statement (/* in columns 1 and 2) are transmitted to the
Nnode named KGNMVS45.

NExample 3: /* on JES3.
N----------------------
NIn this example, the JCL is processed through an internal reader on the
Nsending system. The records between the XMIT JCL statement and the
Ndelimiter statement, which must contain AA in columns 1 and 2 as
Nspecified in the DLM parameter, are transmitted to the node named
NSANFRAN.
N
NTo transmit the /*EOF and /*DEL internal reader control statements,
N/* had to be replaced with /+ in columns 1 and 2 on both statements
Nin the XMIT JCL stream and SUBCHARS='/+' is coded on the XMIT
Nstatement. The sending system does not recognize /+EOF and /+DEL as
Ninternal reader statements. Then prior to transmission, the sending
Nsystem converted /+ to /* and sent /*EOF and /*DEL to the receiving
Nnode, which can then process the internal reader control statements.

MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MWhile you can send /*DEL, why bother? Save some resources and do not
MXMIT something you do not want to execute.
