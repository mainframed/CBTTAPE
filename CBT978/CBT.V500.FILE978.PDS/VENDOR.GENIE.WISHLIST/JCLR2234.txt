N====================
NFORMDEF Parameter
N-----------------
NUse the FORMDEF parameter to identify a library member that contains
Nstatements to tell the Print Services Facility (PSF) how to print
Nthe sysout data set on a page-mode printer (such as the
N3800 Printing Subsystem Model 3). The statements can specify the
Nfollowing:
N
N->Overlay forms to be used during printing.
N->Location on the page where overlays are to be placed.
N->Suppressions that can be activated for specified page formats.
N
NThe member must be in the library named in the cataloged procedure
Nthat was used to initialize PSF, or in a library specified in the
NUSERLIB parameter.
N
NNote: FORMDEF applies only for data sets printed on a PSF-managed
NAFP printer.
