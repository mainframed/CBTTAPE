N-----------------------------
NHow transaction trace works
N---------------------------
NTransaction trace (TTrace) is attached as a daughter task in the system
Ntrace address space, after master scheduler initialization completes.
NOnce initialization has completed, and the first transaction trace
Ncommand is entered with a filter that specifies the attributes of the
Nwork unit(s) to be traced, transaction trace is activated. Additional
Ninformation, such as the use of an external writer, is also allowable
Nfor transaction trace processing.
