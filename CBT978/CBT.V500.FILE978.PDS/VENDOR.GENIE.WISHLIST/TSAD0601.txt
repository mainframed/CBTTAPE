NChapter 6: SNAP Dump
N--------------------
NObtaining SNAP dumps
N--------------------
NProvide a data set to receive the dump, then arrange to print the
Ndump. The SNAP or SNAPX macros in a program can place their dumps in
Nthe same or different data sets; the DCB parameter in each SNAP or
NSNAPX macro indicates the data set.
N
NObtain a SNAP dump by taking the following steps:
N-------------------------------------------------
N1. Code a DD statement in the JCL for the job step that runs the
N   problem program to be dumped with a ddname other than SYSUDUMP,
N   SYSABEND, SYSMDUMP, or another restricted ddname.
N
N2. In the problem program:
N   a. Specify a data control block (DCB) for the data set to receive
N      the dump. For a standard dump, which has 120 characters per
N      line, the DCB must specify:
N
N      DDNAME=anyname but SYSABEND, SYSMDUMP or SYSUDUMP
N      BLKSIZE=882 or 1632
M      Find the better BLKSIZE for where you capture the dump.
N      DSORG=PS
N      LRECL=125
I            125 - 4 (rdw) - 1 (printer control code) leaves 120
I            characters for the report lines.
N      MACRF=(W)
N      RECFM=VBA
N
N      For a high-density dump, which has 204 characters per line and
N      will be printed on an APA 3800 printer, the DCB must specify:
N
N      DDNAME=anyname but SYSABEND, SYSMDUMP or SYSUDUMP
N      BLKSIZE=1470 or 2724
M      Find the better BLKSIZE for where you capture the dump.
N      DSORG=PS
N      LRECL=209
I            209 - 4 (rdw) - 1 (printer control code) leaves 204
I            characters for the report lines.
N      MACRF=(W)
N      RECFM=VBA
N
N   b. Code an OPEN macro to open the DCB. Before you issue the SNAP
N      or SNAPX macro, you must open the DCB that you designate on the
N      DCB parameter, and ensure that the DCB is not closed until the
N      macro returns control.
N
N   c. Code a SNAP or SNAPX assembler macro to request the dump. Repeat
N      this macro in the program as many times as wanted, changing
N      the dump identifier for a unique dump. The system writes all the
N      dumps that specify the same DCB to the same data set.
N
NExample: Coding the SNAP Macro
N------------------------------
NIn the following example, the SNAP macro requests a dump of a
Nstorage area, with the DCB address in register 3, a dump identifier of
N245, the storage area's starting address in register 4, and the ending
Naddress in register 5:
N
D         SNAP DCB=(3),ID=245,STORAGE=((4),(5))
N
N   d. Close the DCB with a CLOSE assembler macro.
N
NExample: Two SNAP Dump Requests in a Program
N--------------------------------------------
NThe following example shows a problem program that requests two SNAP
Ndumps. Both SNAP macros in the example specify the same data control
Nblock (DCB) to place both dumps in the same data set. Each dump has a
Ndifferent identifier: PIC3 for the first dump, PIC4 for the second.
NBoth dumps show the same areas: the control blocks. Thus, the
Nprogrammer can see these areas at two points in the program's
Nprocessing.
N
DSNAPDCB  DCB BLKSIZE=882,DSORG=PS,LRECL=125,MACRF=(W),RECFM=VBA
D         ...
D         OPEN SNAPDCB,OUTPUT
D         LA 3,SNAPDCB
D         SNAP DCB=(3),ID=PIC3,SDATA=CB
D         ...
D         SNAP DCB=(3),ID=PIC4,SDATA=CB
D         CLOSE SNAPDCB
N
N3. Print or view the data set. The output of the SNAP or SNAPX macro
N   is a standard EBCDIC data set with ANSII characters in column one.
N
NExample: Printing a SNAP Dump
N-----------------------------
NThe following JCL prints a SNAP dump. Because the system formats the
Ndump when creating it, the IEBPTPCH utility program can print the
Ndump. The dump is in the SNAPSHOT data set.
N
D//JOBCARD ...
D//RUNTIME EXEC PGM=YOURPGM
D//SNAPDCB   DD DISP=(NEW,CATLG),DSN=SNAPSHOT,
D//             UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,(200,200))
D//*            DCB=what is in the program.
D//*
D//PRINT   EXEC PGM=IEBPTPCH
D//SYSIN     DD *
D  PRINT TYPORG=PS
D/*
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=OLD,DSN=SNAPSHOT
D//SYSUT2    DD SYSOUT=A
* End of WISH.
