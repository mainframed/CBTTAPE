N--------------------------
NSyntax for IMPORT CONNECT Parameters
N------------------------------------
D  IMPORT -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    CONNECT /* Abbreviation: CON */ -
I      specifies that a user catalog or volume catalog is to be
I      connected to the master catalog in the receiving system. When
I      you use CONNECT, you must also use OBJECTS to provide the user
I      or tape volume catalog's name, DASD volser, and DASD volume
I      device type.
N
D    OBJECTS( /* Abbreviation: OBJ */ -
D      (catname -
D         DEVICETYPE(devtype) /* Abbreviation: DEVT */ -
D         VOLUMES(volser) /* Abbreviation: VOL */ -
D      ) -
D    ) -
I      specifies the user or tape volume catalog to be connected.
N
I      catname: specifies the name of the user or tape volume catalog
I        being connected.
N
I      DEVICETYPE(devtype) /* Abbreviation: DEVT */: specifies the
I        device type of the volume that contains the user or tape
I        volume catalog that is to be connected. You can specify a
I        device type for any direct access device that is supported.
N
I      VOLUMES(volser) /* Abbreviation: VOL */: specifies the volume
I        containing the user or tape volume catalog.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    ALIAS | /* Abbreviation: ALS */ -
I      specifies that alias associations for the already connected user
I      catalog are to be retained.
N
I      The specification of ALIAS during an IMPORT CONNECT operation is
I      intended for cases in which the volume serial information, or
I      device type, or both, of the user catalog has changed since the
I      DEFINE or previous IMPORT CONNECT operation. Specifying ALIAS
I      results in an operation that is similar to an EXPORT
I      DISCONNECT/IMPORT CONNECT sequence, except that any aliases that
I      are of the user catalog are preserved.
N
D    VOLCATALOG /* Abbreviation: VOLCAT */ /* - */
I      specifies that a volume catalog is to be connected.
N
M    CATALOG(catname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      specifies the name of the catalog into which to define the
I      catalog you are connecting. This parameter is required when you
I      want to direct the catalog's entry to a particular catalog other
I      than the master catalog.
N
I      To specify catalog names for SMS-managed data sets, you must have
I      authority from the RACF STGADMIN.IGG.DIRCAT FACILITY class.
I      Search "Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) Considerations" for
I      more information.
N
I      catname: is the name of the catalog or an ALIAS of the catalog
I        into which to define the entry being imported. If you are
I        import connecting a user catalog, the specified catalog is
I        usually the master catalog.
