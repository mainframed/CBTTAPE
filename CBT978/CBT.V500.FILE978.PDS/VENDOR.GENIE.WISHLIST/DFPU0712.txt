NExample 12: Build Graphic Characters in a Character Arrangement
NTable Module
N---------------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, an existing character arrangement table module is
Ncopied and used as the basis for a new module that will include
Nuser-designed characters of a graphic character modification module.
NThe new module is then added to the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
N
D//CHARMOD3 JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBIMAGE
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=SYS1.IMAGELIB
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         INCLUDE ONB
D         TABLE   GCMLIST=ONB1,LOC=((6F,2F,1),(7C,3C,1),(6A,2A,0))
D         NAME    ONBZ
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the character
N  arrangement table named ONB is to be used as a basis for the new
N  module. ONB refers to two WCGMs.
N
N  The TABLE statement identifies a graphic character modification
N  module and stipulates the translation table entries for each of its
N  segments:
N
N  GCMLIST=ONB1 identifies the graphic character modification module
N  named ONB1. The LOC parameter specifies the translate table entry
N  location, character position, and WCGM number for each segment of
N  the module:
I
I    The first segment corresponds to the 8-bit data code X'6F'. The
I    segments' scan pattern is to be loaded at character position X'2F'
I    (that is, the 48th character position) in the second WCGM.
I
I    The second segment corresponds to the 8-bit data code X'7C'. The
I    segment's scan pattern is to be loaded at character position X'3C'
I    (that is, the 61st character position) in the second WCGM.
I
I    The third segment corresponds to the 8-bit data code X'6A'. The
I    segment's scan pattern is to be loaded at character position X'2A'
I    (that is, the 43rd character position) in the first WCGM.
I
N  The name of the new character arrangement table is ONBZ; it is
N  stored as a new module in the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
