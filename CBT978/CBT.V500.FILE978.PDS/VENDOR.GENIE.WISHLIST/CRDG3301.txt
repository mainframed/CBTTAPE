NChapter 33. TSMODEL resources
N-----------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    TSMODEL(name)
I      Specifies the name of this TSMODEL resource
I      definition. The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      Embedded blanks are not acceptable.
N
I      This name is used to identify the TSMODEL resource definition on
I      the CSD file. It is not used within the active CICS system.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    EXPIRYINTMIN(0 | number)
I      Specifies the expiry interval, in minutes,
I      for a temporary storage queue that matches this model. CICS uses
I      the value rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 minutes. The
I      interval count begins after each use of the temporary storage
I      queue. If the queue is not used again before the expiry interval
I      is reached, the queue becomes eligible for CICS to delete it
I      automatically.
N
I      0: No expiry interval applies to temporary storage queues that
I        match this model, and they are never eligible for automatic
I        deletion. This setting is the default.
N
I      number: An expiry interval in minutes, in the range 1 - 900000.
I        After this expiry interval, a temporary storage queue that
I        matches this model becomes eligible for automatic deletion if it
I        has not been used again.
N
I      Expiry intervals apply to temporary storage queues in the following
I      locations:
N
I      -> Main temporary storage in the local CICS region.
N
I      -> Nonrecoverable auxiliary temporary storage (DFHTEMP data set)
I         associated with the local CICS region.
N
I      -> Temporary storage queues in shared temporary storage pools
I         (CICS TS 5.2 and higher).
N
I      Expiry intervals do not apply to the following types of temporary
I      storage queues, so CICS never deletes them automatically:
N
I      -> Queues in auxiliary temporary storage that are defined as
I         recoverable.
N
I      -> Queues in a remote CICS region. To make CICS delete remote
I         temporary storage queues, specify an expiry interval in a
I         suitable TSMODEL resource definition in the region that owns
I         the queues.
N
I      -> Queues that CICS creates for its own use.
N
I      If you change the expiry interval in a TSMODEL resource definition,
I      existing temporary storage queues that match the model are not
I      affected. Those queues continue to use the expiry interval that
I      applied when they were created. If all the TSMODEL resource
I      definitions with a nonzero expiry interval are deleted from a
I      CICS region, CICS stops scanning for expired temporary storage
I      queues.
N
D    LOCATION(AUXILIARY | MAIN)
I      Specifies whether the queue is to be
I      held in auxiliary or main storage:
N
I      AUXILIARY: Queues matching this model are to be held in auxiliary
I        temporary storage. Whatever is specified on the API request is
I        disregarded.
N
I      MAIN: Queues matching this model are to be held in main temporary
I        storage. Whatever is specified on the API request is disregarded.
N
I      LOCATION is ignored for temporary storage models that relate to
I      remote queues and to queues in shared temporary storage pools.
I      Using LOCATION in a TSMODEL resource definition for a remote queue
I      allows the same definition to be installed in both a local and
I      remote region. See Shared resources for intercommunication in
I      Product overview.
N
D    POOLNAME(pool)
I      Specifies the name of the shared TS pool definition
I      that you want to use with this TSMODEL resource definition. The
I      name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      Embedded blanks are not acceptable and a name consisting entirely
I      of blanks is treated as though no pool name had been supplied.
N
I      You cannot specify POOLNAME if REMOTESYSTEM is also specified.
N
I      CICS does not search for a matching TSMODEL resource definition
I      if an application program specifies a SYSID on the EXEC CICS
I      temporary storage command, or if a SYSID is added by an XTSEREQ
I      global user exit program. To enable CICS to find the name of a
I      temporary storage data sharing pool when the application program
I      explicitly specifies a SYSID, you must use a temporary storage
I      table (TST) with a suitable TYPE=SHARED entry.
N
D    PREFIX(prefix)
I      Specifies the character string that CICS uses to
I      identify matching temporary storage queues. The prefix can be up
I      to 16 characters in length.
N
I      In the simplest case, a prefix matches the TS queue names that
I      start with the prefix. For example, the prefix ABCD matches queue
I      names ABCD, ABCDE, and ABCD99.
N
I      You can use the generic character (+) one or more times within the
I      prefix to match any character in a TS queue name. For example, the
I      prefix A++D matches queue names: ABCD, A99D, and ABCD99. It does
I      not match ABD. You do not need to specify + characters at the end
I      of a prefix; you can think of a prefix as being padded on the
I      right with + characters, up to the maximum length of a TS queue
I      name (16 characters). For example, a prefix of ABC is exactly
I      equivalent to a prefix of ABC+ or ABC+++++.
N
I      When you use the + character in a prefix, you might find that,
I      considered individually, more than one prefix matches a TS queue
I      name. In this situation, CICS uses the following rules to select
I      the matching TS model:
N
I      -> Characters that are exactly specified in the prefix are a
I         stronger match than the + character.
N
I      -> Characters are compared one at a time, from left to right, and
I         matching characters are a stronger match the further to the
I         left they are.
N
I      For example:
N
I      -> Queue name ABCD99 matches prefix ABCD rather than AB+D: In the
I         first prefix, the four matching characters are specified
I         exactly; in the second, only three characters are specified
I         exactly.
N
I      -> Queue name ABCD99 matches prefix ABC+ rather than AB+D: In both
I         prefixes, the same number of matching characters are specified
I         exactly. However, the third character that matches exactly is
I         further to the left in the first prefix.
N
I      Creating a TSMODEL definition with a blank prefix can produce
I      unexpected results. A TSMODEL definition with a blank prefix
I      matches any queue name that is not matched by any other TSMODEL
I      definition.
N
I      To enable CICS to find the name of a temporary storage data sharing
I      pool when the application program explicitly specifies a SYSID,
I      you must use a temporary storage table (TST) with a suitable
I      TYPE=SHARED entry.
N
D    RECOVERY(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether queues matching this model
I      are to be recoverable.
N
I      NO: Queues matching this model are unrecoverable.
N
I      YES: Queues matching this model are recoverable.
N
I      RECOVERY(YES) is not allowed with LOCATION(MAIN).
N
D    REMOTEPREFIX(prefix)
I      Specifies the character string that CICS uses
I      to identify matching temporary storage queues in the remote system.
I      The prefix can be up to 16 characters in length.
N
I      REMOTEPREFIX is not allowed unless REMOTESYSTEM is also specified.
I      The length of the REMOTEPREFIX attribute must be the same as the
I      PREFIX attribute.
N
I      The rules for character matching in the REMOTEPREFIX attribute are
I      the same as for the PREFIX attribute. If you use + characters for
I      generic matching, they must be in the same position in PREFIX and
I      REMOTEPREFIX. For example:
N
I      PREFIX: A++D
I      REMOTEPREFIX: X++Y
N
D    REMOTESYSTEM(connection)
I      Specifies the name of the connection that
I      links the local system to the remote system where the temporary
I      storage queue resides.
N
I      Embedded blanks are not acceptable and a name consisting entirely
I      of blanks is treated as though no remote system had been specified.
N
I      REMOTESYSTEM and POOLNAME are mutually exclusive. If REMOTESYSTEM
I      is specified, POOLNAME is ignored.
N
D    SECURITY(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether security checking is to be
I      performed for queues matching this model.
N
I      NO: Security checking is not to be performed for queues matching
I        this model.
N
I      YES: Security checking is to be performed for queues matching this
I        model.
N
I      For more information, see the CICS RACF Security Guide.
N
D    XPREFIX(xprefix)
I      Can be used as an alternative to PREFIX. Enter a
I      hexadecimal string, up to 32 characters in length, that is to be
I      used as the prefix for this model. Because XPREFIX is specified
I      in hexadecimal form, you can use a name that contains characters
I      that you cannot enter in the PREFIX attribute.
N
I      To specify generic characters in the XPREFIX attribute, code X'4E'.
N
I      The rules for matching the XPREFIX to TS queue names are the same
I      as they are for the PREFIX attribute.
N
D    XREMOTEPFX(xprefix)
I      Can be used as an alternative to REMOTEPREFIX.
I      Enter a hexadecimal string, up to 32 characters in length, that
I      is to be used as the prefix on the remote system. Because
I      XREMOTEPFX is specified in hexadecimal form, you can use a name
I      that contains characters that you cannot enter in the REMOTEPREFIX
I      attribute.
N
I      To specify generic characters in the XPREFIX attribute, code X'4E'.
N
I      The rules for matching the XREMOTEPFX to TS queue names are the
I      same as they are for the REMOTEPREFIX attribute.
