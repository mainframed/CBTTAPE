NThe JCL statements are:
N-----------------------
N-> BACKUP: describes the portable file that is to BACKUP a copy of
N   the catalog.
N
NThe EXPORT parameters are:
N--------------------------
N-> ZZZ.EXAMPLE.KSDS1: identifies the cluster to be exported.
N
N-> INHIBITSOURCE: specifies that the copy of the cluster that remains
N   in the original system, as a result of TEMPORARY, cannot be
N   modified. User programs are allowed only to read the cluster's
N   records.
N
N-> OUTFILE: points to the BACKUP DD statement. The BACKUP DD statement
N   describes the portable data set, CATBACK.EXAMPLE.KSDS1(+1), that is
N   to BACKUP a copy of the catalog.
N
N-> TEMPORARY: specifies that the cluster is not to be deleted. The
N   cluster's catalog entry is marked "temporary" to indicate that
N   another copy of the cluster exists and that the original copy can
N   be replaced. (Search the IMPORT Example, "Example 3: Import a
N   Key-Sequenced Cluster".)
