NExample 1: Build a New 3800 Forms Control Buffer Module
N-------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, the vertical spacing and channel codes for an 11-inch
Nform are specified, and the module is added to the SYS1.IMAGELIB data
Nset as a new member.
N
D//FCBMOD1  JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBIMAGE
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=SYS1.IMAGELIB
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         FCB  CH1=1,CH12=80,LPI=8
D         NAME IJ
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
I  FCB defines the characteristics for the named FCB.
I
N  CH1=1 specifies channel 1 code for line 1, allowing for positioning
N  at line 1.
N
N  CH12=80 specifies channel 12 code for line 80, allowing for
N  positioning at line 80 and a unit exception indication at line 80
N  (the last printable line on the page.)
N
N  LPI=8 specifies that the entire form is to be at a vertical spacing
N  of 8 lines per inch. Because the SIZE parameter is omitted, the form
N  length defaults to 11 inches. Because there are 10 inches of
N  printable space in an 11-inch form, 80 lines are printed at 8 lines
N  per inch.
N
N  The name of the new FCB module is IJ; it is stored as a member of
N  the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
* End of WISH.
