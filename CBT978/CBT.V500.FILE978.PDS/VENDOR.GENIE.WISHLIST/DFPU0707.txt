N--------------------------------------------------
NExample 7: Build a 4248 Forms Control Buffer Module
N---------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a new 4248 default FCB module is built using an
Nexisting FCB module as a model. The new module, NEW1, is added to
NSYS1.IMAGELIB as a new member. The existing module, OLD1, remains
Nunchanged. OLD1 may be a 4248 FCB called FCB4OLD1, or it may be a 3211
NFCB called FCB2OLD1. (If both modules existed, FCB4OLD1 would be used.)

D//FCBMOD7  JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBIMAGE
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=SYS1.IMAGELIB
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         OPTION DEVICE=4248

D         FCB  COPYP=67,PSPEED=M,DEFAULT=YES
D         NAME NEW1
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  DEVICE=4248 on the OPTION statement specifies that this module is to
N  be created for the 4248 printer.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the existing module
N  OLD1 is to be used as a basis for the new module, NEW1.
N
N  COPYP=67 indicates that the horizontal copy feature should be
N  activated, and that horizontal copies should begin printing in the
N  67th print position from the left margin. This setting overrides any
N  COPYP value previously set in module OLD1; it applies to module
N  NEW1, but does not change the value set in OLD1.
N
I  Note that the value 67 divides a 132-hammer printer into two equal
I  copy areas for two equally-sized horizontal copies. With COPYP=67, a
I  maximum of 66 bytes can be sent to the printer.
N
N  PSPEED=M indicates that the printer speed should be set to medium
N  (3000 LPM). This setting overrides any PSPEED value previously set
N  in module OLD1; it applies to module NEW1, but does not change the
N  value set in OLD1.
N
N  DEFAULT=YES indicates that this module, NEW1, should become a
N  default FCB module for this installation.
N
N  Because these parameters are not specified, the values of LINES,
N  SIZE, LPI, and CHx default to the values which already exist in
N  module OLD1.
N
N  The NAME statement indicates that this module should be called NEW1.
