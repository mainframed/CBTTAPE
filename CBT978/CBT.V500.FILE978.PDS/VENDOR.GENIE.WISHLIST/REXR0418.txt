NBuilt-in functions

NDELWORD
N-------
NDELWORD returns string after deleting the substring that starts at the
Nnth word and is of length blank-delimited words. If you omit length,
Nor if length is greater than the number of words from n to the end of
Nstring, the function deletes the remaining words in string (including
Nthe nth word). The length must be a positive whole number or zero. The
Nn must be a positive whole number. If n is greater than the number of
Nwords in string, the function returns string unchanged. The string
Ndeleted includes any blanks following the final word involved but none
Nof the blanks preceding the first word involved.

NExample
N-------
I  SAY "FIRST LET ME SHOW YOU DELSTR, THEN DELWORD."
I  Say "DelStr"
I  del_string = "has"
I  del_length = Length(del_string)
I  old_sentence = "This sentence had has an error in it."
I  new_sentence = old_sentence
I  del_position = Pos(del_string,old_sentence)
I  If (del_position > 0) Then DO
I    new_sentence = DelStr(old_sentence,del_position,del_length)
I  End
I  Say old_sentence
I  Say new_sentence
I  Say "Note the extra space that is left behind."
I  Say ""
I
I  Say "DelWord"
I  del_string = "has"
I  del_length = Words(del_string)
I  old_sentence = "This sentence had has an error in it."
I  new_sentence = old_sentence
I  del_position = WordPos(del_string,old_sentence)
I  If (del_position > 0) Then DO
I    new_sentence = DelWord(old_sentence,del_position,del_length)
I  End
I  Say old_sentence
