NExample 5: Create New Master Data Set and Delete Selected Records
N-----------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a new master sequential data set is created from
Npartitioned input and selected logical records are deleted.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input partitioned data set DCB.PARTDS, which
N  resides on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output sequential data set, SEQDS. The data
N  set is written as the second data set on a tape volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  CHANGE identifies the input member (OLDMEMB1) and indicates that the
N  output is a sequential data set (NEW=PS).
N
N  The first data statement replaces the logical record whose sequence
N  number is identical to the sequence number in the data statement
N  (00000123). If no such logical record exists, the data statement is
N  incorporated in the proper sequence within the output data set.
N
N  The DELETE detail statement deletes logical records having sequence
N  numbers from 223 through 246, inclusive.
N
N  The second data statement is inserted in the proper sequence in the
N  output data set, because no logical record with the sequence number
N  224 exists (it was deleted in the previous statement).
I
I  Note that only one member can be used as input when converting to
I  sequential organization.
