NChapter 28. LISTDATA
N--------------------
NThe LISTDATA command can be used to obtain the following reports:
N
N-> Subsystem Counters report, which is a record of the counters within
N   the subsystem at the time the report is requested.
N
N-> Subsystem Status report, which is a record of the status within the
N   subsystem at the time the report is requested.
N
N-> Pinned Track to Data Set Cross Reference report, which is a report
N   of pinned tracks in cache and NVS cross-referenced to the data sets
N   involved.
N
N-> Device Status report, which is a report of device status with both
N   the channel connection address (CCA) and the director-to-device
N   connection (DDC) address for each device. This report is useful in
N   determining the state of devices that are used in a dual copy pair
N   (usually called duplex pairs).
N
N-> RAID Rank Counters report, which contains data on logical, not
N   physical, volumes on the RAID disk. This report is issued when
N   COUNTS SUBSYSTEM or COUNTS ALL are specified.
N
N-> Space efficient volume status report, which is a report of the space
N   efficient volumes on the subsystem.
N
N-> Extent pool configuration status report, which is a report of the
N   extent pools on the storage controller or details about specific
N   extent pools.
