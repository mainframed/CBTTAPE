NChapter 4. Functions
N--------------------
N  Built-in functions
N  ------------------
N    ABBREV:     returns 1 if info is equal to the leading characters
N                of information and the length of info is not less than
N                length. Returns 0 if either of these conditions is not
N                met.
N    ABS:        returns the absolute value of number. The result has
N                no sign and is formatted according to the current
N                NUMERIC settings.
N    ADDRESS:    returns the name of the environment to which commands
N                are currently being submitted.
N    ARG:        returns an argument string or information about the
N                argument strings to a program or internal routine.
N    BITAND:     returns a string composed of the two input strings
N                logically ANDed together, bit by bit.
N    BITOR:      returns a string composed of the two input strings
N                logically inclusive-ORed together, bit by bit.
N    BITXOR:     returns a string composed of the two input strings
N                logically eXclusive-ORed together, bit by bit.
N    B2X:        returns a string, in character format, that represents
N                binary_string converted to hexadecimal.
N    CENTER:     returns a string of length length with string centered
N                in it, with pad characters added as necessary to make
N                up length.
N    COMPARE:    returns 0 if the strings, string1 and string2, are
N                identical. Otherwise, returns the position of the
N                first character that does not match.
N    CONDITION:  returns the condition information associated with the
N                current trapped condition.

N    C2D:        returns the decimal value of the binary representation
N                of string. If the result cannot be expressed as a
N                whole number, an error results. That is, the result
N                must not have more digits than the current setting of

N    C2X:        returns a string, in character format, that represents

N                contains twice as many bytes as the input string.
N    DATATYPE:   returns NUM if you specify only string and if string
N                is a valid REXX number that can be added to 0 without
N                error; returns CHAR if string is not a valid number.
N    DATE:       returns, by default, the local date in the format:
N                  dd mon yyyy (day, month, year), for example:

N                with no leading zero or blank on the day.
N    DBCS:       See Appendix A. Double-byte character set (DBCS)
N                support.

N                starts at the nth word and is of length

N    DIGITS:     returns the current setting of NUMERIC DIGITS.
N    D2C:        returns a string, in character format, that represents

N    D2X:        returns a string, in character format, that represents
N                wholenumber, a decimal number, converted to
N                hexadecimal.
N    ERRORTEXT:  returns the REXX error message associated with error
N                number n.
N    EXTERNALS:  always returns a 0.
N    FIND:       WORDPOS is the preferred built-in function for this

N                length, into the string target after the nth
N                character.
N    JUSTIFY:    returns string formatted by adding pad characters
N                between blank-delimited words to justify to both
N                margins.

N                formatted according to the current NUMERIC settings.
N    OVERLAY:    returns the string target, which, starting at the nth
N                character, is overlaid with the string new, padded or
N                truncated to length length.
