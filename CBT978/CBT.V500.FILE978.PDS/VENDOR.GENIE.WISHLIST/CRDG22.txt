NChapter 22. PARTNER resources
N-----------------------------
NA PARTNER resource enables CICS application programs to communicate,
Nusing APPC protocols, with a partner application program running on a
Nremote logical unit.
N
NThe interaction between a CICS application program and a partner
Napplication program is called a conversation.
N
NThe PARTNER definition also facilitates the use of the call to the
Ninterface with the communications element of the System Application
NArchitecture (SAA). For more information on the SAA communications
Ninterface, see the Common Programming Interface Communications
NReference.
N
NTo allow the SAA communications interface to be used, you must specify
Nthe following resources:
N
N-> A PROFILE definition (see Chapter 25, "PROFILE resources")
N
N-> A CONNECTION definition (see Chapter 7, "CONNECTION resources,")
N
N-> A SESSIONS definition (see Chapter 27, "SESSIONS resources,")
N
NYou can define your CICS partner information in one of two ways:
N
N-> Create a PARTNER definition
N
N-> In an application program, by setting SYMDESTNAME to a null value,
N   and issuing the appropriate CPI SET calls. See the SC26-4399-09
N   CPI-C Communications Reference for further details.
