NChapter 4: Stand-Alone dump
N---------------------------
NCreating the stand-alone dump program
N-------------------------------------
N1. The first step in creating a stand-alone dump program is selecting
N   tape or DASD as the stand-alone dump IPL volume (residence volume).
N
N2. Code the AMDSADMP macro.
N
DÝsymbol¨ AMDSADMP
D                 Ý,IPL={Tunit|Dunit|DSYSDA}¨
I                   Indicates the device number, device type, or
I                   esoteric name of the stand-alone dump residence
I                   volume. The first character indicates the volume
I                   type; T for tape, D for DASD.stand-alone dump uses
I                   the unit character string as the UNIT=value to
I                   allocate the residence volume for initialization.
I
I                   A device number consists of 1 to 4 hexadecimal
I                   digits, optionally preceded by a slash (/). Use a
I                   slash preceding a 4-digit device number to
I                   distinguish it from a device type.
I
D                 Ý,VOLSER={volser|SADUMP}¨
I                   Indicates the volume serial number the system is to
I                   use to allocate the residence volume for
I                   initialization. When you specify a tape volume, it
I                   must be NL (no labels). VOLSER=SADUMP is the default.
M                   Message from Kenneth Tomiak:
M                   Your tape subsystem should support catalogued NL
M                   tape. Be aware that when you create the
M                   SADMP program as NL, the system will prompt you
M                   TWICE to confirm NO LABEL foromat.
M
M                   Message from Kenneth Tomiak:
M                   Consider using the system's master catalog volser.
I
D                 Ý,ULABEL={PURGE|NOPURGE}¨
I                   Indicates whether stand-alone dump deletes (PURGE)
I                   or retains (NOPURGE) existing user labels on a DASD
I                   residence volume.When you specify NOPURGE, the
I                   stand-alone dump program is written on cylinder 0
I                   track 0 of the residence volume, immediately
I                   following all user labels. If the user labels
I                   occupy so much space that the stand-alone dump
I                   program does not fit on track 0, the initialization
I                   program issues an error message and ends.
I
D                 Ý,CONSOLE=({cnum|(cnum,ctype) +
D                 Ý,(cnum,ctype)¨...|01F,3278})¨
I                   Indicates the device numbers and device types of the
I                   stand-alone dump consoles that stand-alone dump is
I                   to use while taking the dump. When you specify
I                   CONSOLE=cnum, stand-alone dump assumes (cnum,3278).
I                   You can specify from two to 21 consoles by coding:
I                     CONSOLE=((SYSC)|(cnum,ctype),(cnum,ctype),
D                              Ý,(cnum,ctype)¨...)
I
I                   A device number consists of 3 or 4 hexadecimal
I                   digits, optionally preceded by a slash (/). Use a
I                   slash preceding a 4-digit device number to
I                   distinguish it from a device type.
I
I                   The 3277, 3278, 3279, and 3290 device types are
I                   valid, and are interchangeable.
I
I                   CONSOLE=(01F,3278) is the default.
I
I                   You can specify CONSOLE=SYSC for the first console
I                   only. SYSC is a constant representing the hardware
I                   system console.
I
I                   Note: The specification of CONSOLE does not affect
I                   the availability of the system console.
I
D                 Ý,SYSUT={unit|SYSDA}¨
I                   Specifies the UNIT=value of the device that
I                   stand-alone dump uses for work files during
I                   stand-alone dump initialization. You can specify the
I                   device as a group name (for example, SYSDA), a
I                   device type (for example, 3330), or a unit
I                   address (for example, 131). SYSUT=SYSDA is the
I                   default.
I
D                 Ý,OUTPUT={Tunit|Dunit|(Dunit,ddsname)|T0282}¨
I                   Indicates the device type, number, and data set
I                   name that stand-alone dump uses as a default
I                   value if the operator uses the EXTERNAL INTERRUPT
I                   key to bypass console communication, or if the
I                   operator provides a null response to message
I                   AMD001A during stand-alone dump initialization.
I                   OUTPUT=T0282 is the default.
I
I                   The device type can be specified as either a 'T'
I                   for tape or 'D' for DASD.
I
I                   The device number consists of 3 or 4 hexadecimal
I                   digits, optionally preceded by a slash (/). Use a
I                   slash preceding a 4-digit device number to
I                   distinguish it from a device type.
I
I                   If the default device is a DASD, you can also set
I                   up a default dump data setname to use by specifying
I                   both the device and the dump data set name on the
I                   OUTPUT= parameter. You can specify the first volume
I                   of a multi-volume DASD data set.
I
I                   The AMDSADDD REXX is used to allocate and initialize
I                   the same data set name specified on the OUTPUT=
I                   keyword.
I
D                 Ý,DUMP=('options')¨
I                   Indicates additional virtual storage that you want
I                   dumped. This storage is described as address ranges,
I                   dataspaces, and subpools in address spaces. When
I                   you do not specify DUMP, stand-alone dump does not
I                   dump any additional storage unless you specify
I                   PROMPT.
I
D                 Ý,PROMPT¨
I                   Causes stand-alone dump, at run time, to prompt the
I                   operator for additional virtual storage to be
I                   dumped. The operator can respond with the same
I                   information that can be specified for the DUMP
I                   keyword.
I
D                 Ý,MSG={ACTION|ALLASIDS|ALL}¨
I                   Indicates the type of stand-alone dump messages that
I                   appear on the console. When you specify ACTION,
I                   stand-alone dump writes only messages that require
I                   operator action. When you specify ALL, stand-alone
I                   dump writes most messages to the console. However,
I                   messages AMD010I, AMD057I, AMD076I, AMD081I, and
I                   AMD102I appear only in the stand-alone dump message
I                   log. When you specify ALLASIDS, the stand-alone
I                   dump program behaves as if MSG=ALL was specified,
I                   except that message AMD010I also appears on the
I                   console.
I
I                   ALL is the default.
I
D                 Ý,MINASID={ALL|PHYSIN}¨
I                   Indicates the status of the address spaces that are
I                   to be included in the minimal dump. Specify PHYSIN
I                   to dump the minimum virtual storage (LSQA and
I                   selected system subpools) for the physically
I                   swapped-in address spaces only. Specify ALL to dump
I                   the minimum virtual storage (LSQA and selected
I                   system subpools) for all of the address spaces.
I
I                   ALL is the default.
I
D                 Ý,COMPACT={YES|NO}¨
I                   COMPACT(YES) compacts the data stored on a tape
I                   cartridge if theIDRC hardware feature is available
I                   on your tape drive. If the IDRC feature is available
I                   and you do not specify the COMPACT keyword, the
I                   default is YES, so that IDRC compacts the dump data.
I                   Otherwise, the data is handled as usual.
I
D                 Ý,REUSEDS={CHOICE|ALWAYS|NEVER}¨
I                   Indicates whether stand-alone dump should reuse the
I                   dump data set on the specified output device when it
I                   determines that the data set is valid, however, it
I                   can contain data from a previous dump. Stand-alone
I                   dump determines this by checking to see if the
I                   first record in the data set matches the record
I                   that is written by the AMDSADDD rexx utility. When
I                   you specify ALWAYS, stand-alone dump issues message
I                   AMD094I and reuses the specified dump data set. When
I                   you specify NEVER, stand-alone dump issues message
I                   AMD093I and prompts the operator, through message
I                   AMD001A, for an output device. When you specify
I                   CHOICE, stand-alone dump informs the operator, with
I                   message AMD096A, that the data set is not
I                   reinitialized and requests permission to reuse the
I                   data set.
I
D                 Ý,ALIB=(volser,unit)¨
I                   This parameter is valid only when you are generating
I                   the stand-alone dump program using two-stage
I                   generation.
I
I                   Specifies the volume serial number and UNIT=value of
I                   the volume that contains all of the following system
I                   data sets:
I                   -> SYS1.MODGEN
I                   -> SYS1.LINKLIB
I                   -> SYS1.NUCLEUS
I
I                   Note: The specification of the NUCLIB, LNKLIB, or
I                   MODLIB parameters overrides the corresponding value
I                   specified on the ALIB parameter.
I
D                 Ý,NUCLIB=(volser,unit)¨
I                   Specifies the volume serial number and UNIT=value of
I                   the volume that contains the system data set
I                   SYS1.NUCLEUS. If you specify NUCLIB, there is no
I                   need to specify IPLTEXT, IPITEXT, DVITEXT, DPLTEXT
I                   and PGETEXT DD statements.
I
D                 Ý,MODLIB=(volser,unit)¨
I                   Specifies the volume serial number and UNIT=value
I                   of the volume that contains the system data set
I                   SYS1.MODGEN.
I
D                 Ý,LNKLIB=(volser,unit)¨
I                   Specifies the volume serial number and UNIT=value
I                   of the volume that contains the system data set
I                   SYS1.LINKLIB.
I
D                 Ý,DDSPROMPT={YES|NO}¨
I                   DDSPROMPT=YES allows the stand-alone dump program to
I                   prompt the operator for an output dump data set when
I                   dumping to a DASD device. When DDSPROMPT=YES is
I                   specified, after replying to message AMD001A with a
I                   DASD device number, message AMD002A is also issued
I                   to prompt the operator for a dump data set name.
I
I                   DDSPROMPT=NO indicates that the stand-alone dump
I                   program should not prompt for a dump data set name
I                   when dumping to a DASD device. When DDSPROMPT=NO is
I                   specified, after replying to message AMD001A with a
I                   DASD device number, the stand-alone dump program
I                   uses data set SYS1.SADMP.
I
I                   DDSPROMPT=NO is the default.
I
D                 Ý,AMD029={YES|NO}¨
I                   If AMD029=NO is specified, SADMP does not issue
I                   AMD029D when a 3270 console screen becomes full.
I                   SADMP behaves as if the operator had replied NO to
I                   AMD029D. This parameter is meaningless when the
I                   system console is used, because AMD029D is never
I                   issued for the system console.
I
I                   AMD029 =YES is the default.
I
D                 Ý,IPLEXIST={YES|NO}¨
I                   If IPLEXIST=YES is specified, SADMP includes
I                   IPLEXIST with the ICKDSF parameters, so that
I                   ICKDSF does not prompt the operator with message
I                   ICK21836D if there is already IPL text on the volume.
I
I                   IPLEXIST=NO is the default.
I
D                 Ý,ADDSUMM=('options')¨
I                   Indicates additional address spaces that you want
I                   dumped during a summary phase. Default summary
I                   address spaces are always dumped during a summary
I                   phase. If you do not specify ADDSUMM, stand-alone
I                   dump dumps only the default summary address spaces
I                   unless you specify PROMPT, in which case you have
I                   the opportunity to dump additional address spaces
I                   at run time.
N
N3. Assemble the macro, placing the stand-alone dump program onto the
N   residence volume in ready-to-load form.
N
N
NExample: Generating an unformatted, tape resident dump program
N--------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, the IPL parameter specifies tape as the residence
Nvolume, and the VOLSER parameter identifies that tape. All other
Nparameters are allowed to default.
N
DAMDSADMP IPL=T3400,VOLSER=SATAPE
N
N
NExample: Generating a dump program with output to DASD
N------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, the OUTPUT parameter directs the stand-alone dump
Noutput to dump data set SYS1.SADMP on device 450, and the REUSEDS
Nparameter specifies that the operator be prompted about whether to
Nreuse the dump data set.
N
DAMDSADMP OUTPUT=D450,REUSEDS=CHOICE
N
N
NExample: Generating a dump program with output to DASD
N------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the OUTPUT parameter directs the stand-alone dump
Noutput to dump data set SADMP.DDS1 on device 450. Furthermore, the
NDDSPROMPT=YES keyword allows for run-time dump data set prompting.
N
DAMDSADMP OUTPUT=(D450,SADMP.DDS1),DDSPROMPT=YES
N
N
NUsing the DUMP or ADDSUMM keyword to request additional
Nstorage or address spaces
N-------------------------------------------------------
NYou can request that stand-alone dump dump additional storage or
Nadditional address spaces in two ways:
N
N-> Specifying DUMP options or ADDSUMM options on the AMDSADMP macro.
N
N-> Specifying additional dump options at run time
N
NBy coding the PROMPT keyword on the AMDSADMP macro, you can have
NStand-alone dump prompt the operator to dump additional storage or
Nspecify additional address spaces to be dumped as part of summary
Nphase. When you code PROMPT, and the virtual storage dump program gets
Ncontrol, stand-alone dump issues the AMD059D message:
N
IAMD059D ENTER 'DUMP' OR 'SET' OR 'ADDSUMM' WITH OPTIONS, 'LIST' OR 'END'.
N
NThe operator can respond with one of the following:
N-> DUMP followed by dump options. In this case, the '=' after DUMP is
N   optional.
N
N-> SET followed by the MINASID options.
N
N-> ADDSUMM followed by address space list to additionally be dumped as
N   part of summary phase. In this case, the '=' after ADDSUMM is
N   optional.
N
N-> LIST. On the console, stand-alone dump displays the current virtual
N   storage areas to be dumped and address space list to be dumped
N   during the summary phase.
N
N-> END. Stand-alone dump stops prompting the operator for options and
N   begins processing.
N
NExplanation of dump tailoring options:
N--------------------------------------
NThis section provides an explanation for each of the dump tailoring
Noptions.
N
NRANGE(xxxxxxxx:yyyyyyyy,xxxxxxxx:yyyyyyyy...)
N  Specifies one or more ranges of storage that you want dumped. xxx
N  and yyy are hexadecimal addresses from 0 to X'7FFFFFFF'
N
NRANGE(ALL)
N  Specifies dumping of all storage from 0 to X'7FFFFFFF'
N
NSP(ddd)
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump subpool ddd. ddd is a decimal integer
N  from 0 to 255.
N
NSP(ddd:eee)
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump all subpools from ddd to eee,
N  inclusive.
N
NSP(ddd:eee,ddd:eee,...)
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump the combination of subpools that you
N  specify.
N
NSP(ALL)
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump all subpools, from
N  0 to 255 inclusive.
N
NLSQA
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump the LSQA.
N
NHIGH VIRTUAL
NCauses stand-alone dump to dump all allocated storage above 2G.
N
NASID(xxxx:yyyy)
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump storage for the range of address
N  spaces whose ASIDs begin at xxx and end at yyy, inclusive. xxx
N  and yyy are hexadecimal numbers from X'1' to X'FFFF'.
N
NASID('jjj')
N Causes stand-alone dump to dump storage for the address space that
N  jobname jjj identifies.
N
N  Note that you must enclose the jobname in single quotation mark.
M  Message from Kenneth Tomiak:
M  A single quotation mark is vague, IBM means an apostrophe(').
N
N  Wildcard Characters: You can use wildcard characters to identify
N  multiple jobnames. The valid wildcard characters are:
N
N  * Zero or more characters, up to the maximum length of the string. An
N    asterisk can start the string, end it, appear in the middle of the
N    string, or appear in several places in the string. A
N    single asterisk for the jobname indicates that all jobnames match.

N  ? One character. One or more question marks can start the string, end
N    it, appear in the middle of the string, or appear in several places
N    in the string. A single question mark indicates all jobnames
N    consisting of one character.
N
NASID(SYSKEY)
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump storage for all address spaces whose
N  active TCB has an associated storage key of 0 to 7.
N
NASID(combination)
N  You can combine any of the above specifications. An example of a
N  valid combination is ASID(2,'IMSJOB',SYSKEY).
N
NASID(PHYSIN)
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump storage for physically swapped-in
N  address spaces.
N
NASID(ALL)
N  Causes stand-alone dump to dump storage for all address spaces.
N  Note that you cannot specify ASID(ALL) in combination with any of
N  the other ASID specifications.
N
NDATASPACES OF ASID(qualifier)
N  When you specify the DATASPACES OF ASID(qualifier) keyword,
N  stand-alone dump dumps all data spaces owned by the specified
N  address space. For each requested data space, stand-alone dump:
N
N  -> Dumps pages backed by central storage during the central storage
N     dump
N  -> Copies into central storage and dumps every page that is not a
N     first reference page and not backed by central storage
N
NPAGETABLES OF DATASPACES
N  When you specify the PAGETABLES OF DATASPACES keyword, stand-alone
N  dump dumps paged-out virtual storage that contains the page tables
N  for all data spaces.

NUsing the AMDSADDD utility
N--------------------------
NThe REXX utility AMDSADDD resides in SYS1.SBLSCLI0.
N-> Allocate and initialize the data set.
N-> Clear (reinitialize) the data set.
N-> Reallocate and initialize the data set.
N
NThe IPCS SADMP dump data set utility performs the same functions as
Nthe AMDSADDD REXX utility.
N
N
NExamples of running AMDSADDD in batch mode
N------------------------------------------
NExample 1: allocate and initialize the dump data set SYS1.SADMP.A1
N------------------------------------------------------------------
NThe following example shows how to use JCL to allocate and initialize
Nthe dump data set SYS1.SADMP.A1 on VOL=SER=ZOSSVA with a size of 2,653
Ncylinders. The BASIC type of data set is allocated because the dsntype
Nparameter is not specified.
