NAppendix F. Interpreting DCOLLECT
N---------------------------------
NThis appendix contains General-use Programming Interface and Associated
NGuidance Information.
N
NThis appendix is intended to help you to interpret DCOLLECT output.
NDCOLLECT provides you with data set information, volume usage
Ninformation, and information about data sets and storage controlled by
NDFSMShsm. Running DCOLLECT produces a snapshot of the requested
Ninformation as it exists at that time. DCOLLECT does not monitor the
Ninformation continuously. This information can then be used for
Naccounting, planning, statistical, and other purposes.
N
NThe following output record types are included in this appendix:
N
NType Name
N---- ---------------------------------------------------
N D   Active Data Set Record
N A   VSAM Association Information
N V   Volume Information
N M   Migrated Data Set Information
N B   Backup Data Set Information
N C   DASD Capacity Planning Information
N T   Tape Capacity Planning Information
NDC   Data Class construct information
NSC   Storage Class construct information
NMC   Management Class construct Information
NBC   Base Configuration Information
NSG   Storage Group construct Information
NVL   Storage Group volume Information
NAG   Aggregate Group Information
NDR   OAM Drive Record Information
NLB   OAM Library Record Information

NNote: The fields described here are available in a macro form that can
N be included in an application program. Record formats for the D, A,
Nand V records are mapped by IDCDOUT available in SYS1.MACLIB. Record
Nformats for the M, B, C, and T records are available in ARCUTILP, also
Navailable in SYS1.MACLIB.
