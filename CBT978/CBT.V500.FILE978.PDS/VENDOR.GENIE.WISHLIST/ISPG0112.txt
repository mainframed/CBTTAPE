NDSINFO:   Returns information about a particular data set in dialog
N          variables in the function pool.
N
NLMCLOSE:  Closes a data set.
N
NLMCOMP:   Compresses a partitioned data using either the new compress
N          request exit or IEBCOPY if the exit is not installed.
N
NLMCOPY:   Copies partitioned data set members or sequential data sets,
N          allowing pack and automatic truncation options.
N
NLMDDISP:  Displays the data set list for a specified dslist ID.
N
NLMDFREE:  Removes the link between a dslist ID and a DSNAME LEVEL and
N          VOLUME combination.
N
NLMDINIT:  Associates a DSNAME LEVEL and VOLUME combination with a
N          dslist ID. Thereafter, this dslist ID is used to identify the
N          DSNAME LEVEL and VOLUME combination for processing by other
N          library access services.
N
NLMDLIST:  Creates a data set list for a specified dslist ID.
N
NLMERASE:  Deletes an ISPF library or MVS data set.
N
NLMFREE:   Releases the data set associated with a given data-id.
N
NLMGET:    Reads one record of a data set.
N
NLMINIT:   Associates one or more ISPF libraries or an existing data
N          set with a data-id. Thereafter, this data-id is used to
N          identify the data set for processing by other library access
N          services.
N
NLMMADD:   Adds a member to an ISPF library or a partitioned data set.
N
NLMMDEL:   Deletes a member of an ISPF library or a partitioned data
N          set.
N
NLMMDISP:  Provides member selection lists for:
N
N          -> Single partitioned data sets
N
N          -> Concatenations of up to four partitioned data sets.
N
NLMMFIND:  Finds a member of an ISPF library or a partitioned data set.
N
NLMMLIST:  Creates a member list of an ISPF library or a partitioned
N          data set.
N
NLMMOVE:   Moves partitioned data set members or sequential data sets,
N          allowing pack and automatic truncation options.
N
NLMMREN:   Renames a member of an ISPF library or a partitioned data
N          set.
N
NLMMREP:   Replaces a member of an ISPF library or a partitioned data
N          set.
N
NLMMSTATS: Sets and stores, or deletes ISPF statistics for partitioned
N          data set members that have fixed-length or variable-length
N          records.
N
NLMOPEN:   Opens a data set.
N
NLMPRINT:  Prints to the list data set, with formatting optional.
N
NLMPUT:    Writes one record of a data set.
N
NLMQUERY:  Provides requested information regarding the data set
N          associated with a given data-id.
N
NLMRENAME: Renames an ISPF library.
N
NMEMLIST:  Enables access to the Library Utility member list from within
N          a dialog.
