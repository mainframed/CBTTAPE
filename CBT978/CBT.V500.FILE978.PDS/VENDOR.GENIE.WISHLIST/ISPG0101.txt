NChapter 1. Introduction to ISPF services
N----------------------------------------
NDescription of the services
N---------------------------
NThe services are described in alphabetical order and each service
Ndescription consists of this information:
N
N-> Description: A description of the function and operation of the
N   service. This description also refers to other services that can be
N   used with this service.
N
N-> Format: The syntax used to code the service, showing commands and
N   calls.
N
N-> Parameters: A description of any required or optional keywords or
N   parameters.
N
N-> Return Codes: A description of the codes returned by the service.
N   For all services, a return code of 12 or higher implies a severe
N   error. This error is usually a syntax error, but can be any severe
N   error detected when using the services.
N
N-> Examples: Sample usage of the services.
N
NFor each service, the command procedure or command invocation format
Nis shown, followed by the call or call invocation format.
N
NThe command formats are provided as CLIST or REXX command procedures,
Nusing ISPEXEC.
N
NCall formats are shown in PL/I syntax, although you are not limited to
NPL/I calls. For example, ";" ends statements in the formats described.
NThis is a PL/I convention, but you should use the syntax appropriate
Nfor your programming language.
N
NConsider using the Edit model facilities when you code requests for
NISPF services. This will save keying the parts of dialog elements that
Nare constant regardless of the function in which they are used. See
NSC34-4820-10 z/OS ISPF Edit and Edit Macros or PDF ispzem90.PDF for a
Ndescription of these facilities.
