NChapter 9: Master trace
N-----------------------
NMaster trace maintains a table of all recently issued system messages.
NThis creates a log of external system activity; the other traces log
Ninternal system activity. Master trace is activated automatically at
Nsystem initialization, but you can turn it on or off using the TRACE
Ncommand.
N
NMaster trace can help you diagnose a problem by providing a log of the
Nmost recently issued system messages. For example, master trace output
Nin a dump contains system messages that may be more pertinent to your
Nproblem than the usual component messages issued with a dump.
