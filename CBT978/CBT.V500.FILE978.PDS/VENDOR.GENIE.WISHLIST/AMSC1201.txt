N------------------------
NSyntax for DEFINE ALIAS Parameters
N----------------------------------
D  DEFINE /* Abbreviation: DEF */ -
N
NRequired parameters
N-------------------
D    ALIAS( -
I      Defines an alias for a user catalog or non-VSAM data set.
N
I      If the entryname in the RELATE parameter is non-VSAM, choose an
I      aliasname in the NAME parameter. This is done to ensure the
I      multilevel alias facility selects the catalog that has the
I      entryname.
N
I      The multilevel alias facility and the system-generated name
I      format requires special attention:
N
I      -> When you DEFINE a VSAM data set, point the data/index name to
I         the same catalog as the cluster; otherwise, an error occurs.
N
I      -> During the DEFINE of a VSAM cluster or a generation data group
I         (GDG), if the name of the cluster or GDG matches an existing
I         alias or user catalog, the DEFINE request is denied with a
I         duplicate name error. This prevents the data/index component
I         or a generation data set (GDS) from becoming inaccessible.
N
I      -> When you add an alias to the catalog, ensure it does not cause
I         existing data sets to become inaccessible.
N
I      For more details about using aliases for catalogs, see
I      z/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs.
N
D      NAME(aliasname) -
I        Is the alias (the alternate entryname) for a user catalog or
I        non-VSAM data set. An alias must be unique within a catalog.
N
D      RELATE(entryname) | /* Abbreviation: REL */ -
D      SYMBOLICRELATE(entryname) /* Abbreviation: SYM */ -
I        Restriction: The RELATE and SYMBOLICRELATE parameters are
I        mutually exclusive and cannot be specified at the same time.
I        The resolved value for entryname must be a catalog entry that
I        is located in the same catalog that contains the value for
I        aliasname.
N
I        RELATE(entryname) /* Abbreviation: REL */: Is the name of the
I          entry (the user catalog entryname or the non-VSAM data set
I          name) for which the alias is defined.
N
I        SYMBOLICRELATE(entryname) /* Abbreviation: SYM */: Allows the
I          specification of the base data set name using system
I          symbols.
N
I          For more details, see "Extended Alias Support" in z/OS
I          DFSMS Managing Catalogs.

D    ) /* - */
N
NOptional parameters
N-------------------
M    CATALOG(catname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      Identifies the catalog in which the alias is defined. If the
I      catalog's volume is physically mounted, it is dynamically
I      allocated. The volume must be mounted as permanently resident
I      or reserved. Search "Catalog Selection Order for DEFINE" for the
I      order in which a catalog is selected when the catalog's name is
I      not given.
N
I      catname/alias: Names the catalog or an alias that can be resolved
I        to a catalog. When the alias is for a user catalog connector,
I        catname is the name of the master catalog or user catalog in
I        which the connector record has been defined.
