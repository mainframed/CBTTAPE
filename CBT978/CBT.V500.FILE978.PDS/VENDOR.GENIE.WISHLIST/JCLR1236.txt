NDD Statement
N============
NFCB Parameter
N-------------
NUse the FCB parameter to specify:
N
N-<The forms control buffer (FCB) image JES is to use to guide printing
N  of this sysout data set by a 1403 Printer, 3211 Printer, 3203
N  Printer Model 5, 3800 Printing Subsystem, 4245 Printer, 4248 Printer,
N  or by a printer supported by systems network architecture (SNA)
N  remote job entry (RJE).
N
N->The carriage control tape JES is to use to control printing of this
N  sysout data set by a 1403 Printer or by a printer supported by
N  SNA RJE.
N
N->The data-protection image JES is to use to control output of this
N  sysout data set by a 3525 Card Punch.
N
N->The name of a page definition to be used by PSF in formatting a print
N  data set.
N
NThe FCB image specifies how many lines are to be printed per inch and
Nthe length of the form. JES loads the image into the printer's forms
Ncontrol buffer. The FCB image is stored in SYS1.IMAGELIB. IBM provides
Nthree standard FCB images:
N
N->STD1, which specifies 6 lines per inch on an 8.5-inch-long form.
N  (3211 and 3203-2 only)
N
N->STD2, which specifies 6 lines per inch on an 11-inch-long form.
N  (3211 and 3203-2 only)
N
N->STD3, which specifies 8 lines per inch for a dump on an 11-inch
N  form. (3800 only)
N
D//             FCB= {fcb-name }
D//                  {(fcb-name {,ALIGN } ) }
D//                             {,VERIFY }
NExample 1 + 2: use IMG2 and show image first:
N---------------------------------------------
NThis sysout DD statement specifies output class V. Output class V
Nroutes output to a printer having the forms control buffer feature,
NJES loads the FCB image IMG2 into the forms control buffer. If the
Nprinter does not have the forms control buffer feature, the operator
Nreceives a message to mount the carriage control tape IMG2 on the
Nprinter.
N
NBecause VERIFY is coded, the system displays the FCB image on the
Nprinter before printing the data set.
N
D//DD2       DD SYSOUT=V,FCB=(IMG2,VERIFY)
N
NExample 3: Prompt to align the form:
N------------------------------------
Nin this example, the DD statement defines an output data set to be
Nprinted via output class A. The FCB parameter requests that the data
Nset be printed under control of the FCB image named FCB6. Because ALIGN
Nis coded, the system issues a message to the operator requesting that
Nthe alignment of the printer forms be checked before the data set
Nis printed.
N
D//OUTDDS     DD SYSOUT=A,FCB=(FCB6,ALIGN)
* End of WISH.
