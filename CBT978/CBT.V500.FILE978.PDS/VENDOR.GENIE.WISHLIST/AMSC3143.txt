N--------------------------
NCase 13: Resetting a Duplex Pair to Two Simplex Volumes
N-------------------------------------------------------
NSETCACHE RESETTOSIMPLEX terminates a duplex pair and restores both
Nvolumes to simplex operations. The primary volume retains the DASD
Nfast write status of the dual copy logical volume. The secondary
Nvolume assumes the device status defaults, unless the pair was
Nsuspended, in which case the caching status is inactive. Normally,
Nall updates in NVS and cache are destaged to both the primary and the
Nsecondary volumes.
N
NThe primary volume contains copies of all updates to the volume.
NBecause of a DASD fast write pending condition (probably due to
Nanother job), modified tracks might not have been destaged to the
Nsecondary volume. If the volumes must be identical, either use a
Nutility program to compare the two volumes, or change the secondary
Nvolume serial number using ICKDSF, vary it online, and copy the
Nprimary volume to the secondary volume.
