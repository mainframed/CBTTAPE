N=========================
NChapter 5. Parsing
N------------------
NThe parsing instructions are ARG, PARSE, and PULL.
N
NThe data to parse is a source string. Parsing splits up the data in a
Nsource string and assigns pieces of it into the variables named in a
Ntemplate. A template is a model specifying how to split the source
Nstring. The simplest kind of template consists of only a list of
Nvariable names. Here is an example:
N
N  variable1 variable2 variable3
N
NThis kind of template parses the source string into blank-delimited
Nwords. More complicated templates contain patterns in addition to
Nvariable names. String patterns Match characters in the source string
Nto specify where to split it. (See "Templates containing string
Npatterns" for details.)
N
NPositional patterns Indicate the character positions at which to split
Nthe source string. (See "Templates containing positional (numeric)
Npatterns" for details.)
N
NParsing is essentially a two-step process.
N1. Parse the source string into appropriate substrings using patterns.
N2. Parse each substring into words.
