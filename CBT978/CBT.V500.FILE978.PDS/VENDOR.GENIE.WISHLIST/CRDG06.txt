N----------------------------------------------------------
NChapter 6. BUNDLE resources
N---------------------------
NA BUNDLE resource defines a CICS bundle, a unit of deployment for an
Napplication. A bundle is a collection of CICS resources, artifacts,
Nreferences, and a manifest that you can deploy into a CICS region to
Nrepresent a whole application or a component of an application.
N
NThe manifest is a file that describes the contents of the bundle,
Nincluding what resources to create in the CICS region and the location
Nof the supporting artifacts, what prerequisites are required for the
Napplication to run successfully, and any services that the application
Ncan offer to other applications.
N
NA bundle is deployed to z/OS UNIX and comprises a directory structure
Nof artifacts. The BUNDLE resource defines where the bundle is deployed
Non z/OS UNIX and its status. When you enable a BUNDLE resource, CICS
Nreads the manifest and dynamically creates the application resources
Nthat are defined in the manifest for you. Other resources that are
Ndefined as prerequisites for the application must be present in the
NCICS region to successfully enable the BUNDLE resource.
