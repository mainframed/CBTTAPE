NChapter 21. PARTITIONSET resources
N----------------------------------
NA PARTITIONSET resource defines a partition set, that is, is a table
Nthat describes to CICS how to partition a display screen.
N
NPartition sets are created by coding and assembling a series of
Ncommands.
N
NThe screen areas of some display devices (the 8775 Display Terminal and
Nthe IBM 3290 Information Panel, for example), can be divided into
Npartitions, which can be treated as several different small displays.
NDifferent programs or program steps in a transaction can write to or
Nreceive input from different partitions.
N
NYou specify the partition set with DFHPSD and DFHPDI macros, described
Nfor programming purposes in the CICS Application Programming Reference.
N
NYou specify each different partition configuration as a PARTITIONSET.
NPARTITIONSET definitions are created using CEDA or DFHCSDUP, or they
Ncan be autoinstalled if the appropriate system initialization
Nparameters have been set. See "Autoinstalling programs, map sets, and
Npartition sets" for information.
N
NYou can name the PARTITIONSET that you want the transaction to use in
Nthe TRANSACTION definition. When the transaction starts, the
Ninformation is loaded into the internal buffer of the display device.
