NChapter 17. LIBRARY resources
N-----------------------------
NUse the LIBRARY resource to define the physical and operational
Ncharacteristics of a dynamic program LIBRARY concatenation.
N
NThe LIBRARY definition includes attributes that provide the name of the
Ndata set, or sets, within the LIBRARY resource and other details about
Nthe operational status of the LIBRARY.
N
NDFHRPL is a special example of a LIBRARY which cannot be altered in a
Nrunning CICS system, and does not appear as a resource in CEDA.
N
NData sets in a dynamic program LIBRARY concatenation can reside in the
Nextended addressing space (EAS) of an extended address volume (EAV)
NDASD volume.
N
NThere is no 'group commit' for LIBRARY resources. Each LIBRARY in a
NCSD group is committed separately when the group is installed. To
Nachieve an effect similar to group install, you can use the Disabled
Nstatus to install a set of LIBRARY resources which would then be SET
Nto an Enablestatus of Enabled when all resources are installed.
