N      The TSO host command environment
N      --------------------------------
NThe TSO host command environment is available only to REXX execs that
Nrun in the TSO/E address space. Use the TSO host command environment
Nto invoke TSO/E commands and services. You can also invoke all of the
NTSO/E REXX commands, such as MAKEBUF and NEWSTACK, and invoke other
NREXX execs and CLISTs. When you invoke a REXX exec in the TSO/E
Naddress space, the default initial host command environment is TSO.
N
NNote that the value that can be set in the REXX special variable RC
Nfor the TSO environment is a signed 24-bit number in the
Nrange -8,388,608 to +8,388,607.
