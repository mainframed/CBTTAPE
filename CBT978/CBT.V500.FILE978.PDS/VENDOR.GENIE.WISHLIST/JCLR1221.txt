NDD Statement
N============
NCOPIES Parameter
N----------------
NUse the COPIES parameter to specify how many copies of this sysout
Ndata set are to be printed. The printed output is in page sequence
Nfor each copy.
N
NFor printing on an AFP printer, this parameter can instead specify
Nhow many copies of each page are to be printed before the next page
Nis printed.
N
D//             COPIES= {nnn }
I                       {(nnn,(group-value{,group-value}...))}
I                       {(,(group-value{,group-value}...)) }
I
I               nnn (JES2): 1 - 255
I               nnn (JES3): 1 - 254
I               1 - 8 group-values (JES2): 1 - 255
I               1 - 8 group values (JES3): 1 - 254
N
NExample 1: Specify 32 copies when printed.
N------------------------------------------
NThis example requests 32 copies of the data set defined by DD statement
NRECORD1 when printing on an impact printer or an AFP printer.
N
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A,COPIES=32
N
NExample 2: Repeated pages and copies on AFP.
N--------------------------------------------
NIn this example, when printing on an AFP printer, six copies of the
Ndata set are printed in three groups. The first group contains one copy
Nof each page, the second group contains three copies of each page, and
Nthe last group contains two copies of each page.
N
NWhen the output device is not an AFP printer, the system prints eight
Ncollated copies.
N
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A,COPIES=(8,(1,3,2))
M
MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MI am confused why someone would ask for 8 collated non-AFP copies or 6
MAFP copies. It would make more sense had it been coded as:
M//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A,COPIES=(6,(1,3,2))
M
MPerhaps the IBM author was totally clueless and meant each page will
Mbe printed six times on the AFP printer and 8 times on the non-AFP
Mprinter. Sill confusing to specify 8 but get 6.
M
MThen explain there will be 3 sets, not groups, where set 1 contains
M1 copy of each page, set 2 has 3 copies of each page, and set 3 has 2
Mcopies of each page.
MThe result is rather bizarre anyway, leading me to ask anyone to give
Ma realistic example of producing multiple copies of pages in an
Muncollated set. As well as a realistic example where 8 collated is
Mas useful as the 3 sets of varying copies of each page.
* End of WISH.
