N-----------------------------------------
NExample 1: Copy an Entire Data Set
N----------------------------------
NIn this example, a partitioned data set (DATASET5) is copied from
None disk volume to another.
N
D//COPY     JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(SHR),DSN=DATASET5
D//SYSUT2    DD DISP=(NEW,CATLG),DSN=DATASET4,
D//             UNIT=disk,
D//             SPACE=(TRK,(5,1,2))
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASET5, that contains
N  two members (A and C).
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines a new partitioned data set, DATASET4, that is to
N  be kept after the copy operation. Five tracks are allocated for the
N  data set; two blocks are allocated for directory entries.
N
MBecause the partitioned data set has only two members, SYSUT3 and
MSYSUT4 DD are not needed.
M
MBecause the input and output data sets are identified as SYSUT1 and
MSYSUT2, the SYSIN data set is not needed. The SYSUT1 data set will
Mbe copied in full to the SYSUT2 data set. After the copy operation
Mis finished, DATASET4 will contain the same members that are in
MDATASET5. However, there will be no embedded, unused space in
MDATASET4. If you are copying a PDSE, the processing is the same,
Mexcept that there is no embedded, unused space in a PDSE.
