NExample 3: Convert Sequential Input into Partitioned Members
N------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, sequential input is converted into two partitioned
Nmembers. The newly created members are merged into an existing
Npartitioned data set. User labels on the input data set are passed to
Nthe user exit routine.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set (INSET). The input data set,
N  which resides on a disk volume, has standard user labels.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output partitioned data set (EXISTSET). The
N  members created during this job step are merged into the partitioned
N  data set.
N
N  The SYSIN DD statement is omitted. Because the GENERATE line does
N  not begin with //, the system assumes it is preceded by a
N  //SYSIN DD *
N  line. SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the
N  input stream. The utility control statements are used to create
N  members from sequential input data; the statements do not specify
N  any editing. A /* at the end of any DD * data set is unnecessary
N  because a JCL satement or end of the job stream marks the end of the
N  input stream data set.
M  Kenneth believes the omission of the //SYSIN and /* is a sign of
M  LAZY and SLOPPY coding. Just because you can does not mean that
M  you should.
N
N  GENERATE indicates that a maximum of three names and aliases are
N  included in subsequent MEMBER statements and that one IDENT
N  parameter appears in a subsequent RECORD statement.
N
N  EXITS defines the user routines that are to process user labels.
M  Message from Kenneth:
M  ALAS! Without the source code for those EXITS, this example is
M  worthless.
N
N  The first MEMBER statement assigns a member name (MEMN and an alias
N  (ALIASN to the first member.
N
N  The RECORD statement identifies the last record to be placed in the
N  first member. The name of this record (FIRSTMEM) appears in the
N  first eight positions of the input record.
N
N  The second MEMBER statement assigns a member name (MEMY) to the
N  second member. The remainder of the input data set is included in
N  this member.
