NExample 21: Build a Library Character Set Module and Modify a
NCharacter Arrangement Table to Use It
N-------------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 3
N
NIn this example, a library character set module is built. The module
Ncontains one user-designed character, a reverse 'E', whose 6-bit
NWCGM-location code is designated as X'03', and whose pitch is 10. An
Nexisting character arrangement table is then modified to include the
Nreverse E.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  DEVICE=3800M3 in the OPTION statement specifies 3800 Model 3
N  compatibility mode module format and processing considerations.
N
N  The CHARSET statement's ASSIGN parameter establishes the 6-bit
N  WCGM-location code, X'03', and the width, 10-pitch, for the
N  user-designed character. The data statements that follow the CHARSET
N  statement describe the character's scan pattern.
N
N  The name of the library character set module is 73, and it is stored
N  as a new module in the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the GS10 character
N  arrangement table is to be used as the basis for the new table.
N
N  The TABLE statement specifies the addition of the library character
N  set containing the reverse E to that copy of the GS10 table.
N  CGMID=(83,73) specifies the character set identifier X'83' for the
N  Gothic-10 set (which is the set already used by the GS10 table) and
N  specifies X'73' as a character set identifier to allow loading of
N  the second WCGM with the library character set 73.
N
N  LOC=(E0,03,1) specifies that the reverse E, which has been assigned
N  the WCGM location 03 in the second WCGM, is to be referenced by the
N  EBCDIC code X'E0'.
N
N  The new character arrangement table is named RE10; it is stored as a
N  new module in the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
