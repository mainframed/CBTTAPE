I                      on this DD statement.
N
NExample 1:
N----------
NIn this example, the DD statement defines the size of the user area
Nfor data and index buffers, specifies the number of data and index
Nbuffers, specifies the number of requests that require concurrent
Ndata set positioning, and specifies an error exit routine named ERROR.

D//VSAMDS1   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=DSM.CLASS,
D//             AMP=('BUFND=2,BUFNI=3,BUFSP=200,STRNO=4,SYNAD=ERROR')
N
NExample 2:
N----------
NIn this example, the DD statement defines the values for BUFSP,
NBUFNI, STRNO, and SYNAD, as in the previous example. It also
Nspecifies that a data set post-checkpoint modification test is not
Nto be performed when restarting at a checkpoint and that GTF is to
Nprovide a trace of specified data areas.

MKenneth Tomiak remark:
M'Programming Using The Kenneth Tomiak Method' (PUTKTM) recommends
Mcoding parameters in alphabetic sequence. For that reason these
MIBM examples have been sorted appropriately.
M
MIBM botched using alphabetic ordering when they added some SMB
mrelated parameters. I have them in the proper sequence.
