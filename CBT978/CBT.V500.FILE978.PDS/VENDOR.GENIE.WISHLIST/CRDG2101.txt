NChapter 21. PARTITIONSET resources
N----------------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    PARTITIONSET(name)
I      Sspecifies the name of this PARTITIONSET
I      definition. The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      It is preferable not to use names that start with DFH because these
I      characters are reserved for use by CICS.
N
I      CICS can delete or discard them and replace them with CICS
I      resources when you upgrade or provide new function or fixes.
N
I      For a device-dependent partition set, the partition set name must
I      be derived by adding the partition set suffix to the original
I      (1- to 6-character) partition set name. The suffix depends on the
I      parameter specified in the SUFFIX operand of the DFHPSD macro
I      instruction that defined the partition set.
N
I      To use device-dependent suffixes, you need to specify BMS=(,,,DDS)
I      as a system initialization parameter.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    RESIDENT(NO | YES)
I      Specifies the residence status of the partition
I      set.
N
I      NO: The partition set is not to be permanently resident.
N
I      YES: The partition set is to be loaded on first reference and is
I        then to be permanently resident in virtual storage, but is to be
I        pageable by the operating system.
N
I    RSL: This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS. For more information,
I      see Appendix A, "Obsolete attributes".
N
D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Specifies the partition set status.
N
I      DISABLED: The partition set may not be used.
N
I      ENABLED: The partition set may be used.
N
D    USAGE(NORMAL | TRANSIENT)
I      Specifies when the storage for this
I      partition set is released.
N
I      NORMAL: When the use count for this partition set reaches zero,
I        it becomes eligible for removal from storage as part of the
I        normal dynamic program compression process.
N
I      TRANSIENT: When the use count for this partition set becomes zero,
I        the storage for this partition set is released. This value should
I        be specified for partition sets that are referenced infrequently.
N
D    USELPACOPY(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the partition set is to be
I      used from the link pack area (LPA).
N
I      NO: The partition set is not to be used from the LPA. It is loaded
I        into the CICS partition.
N
I      YES: The partition set can be used from the LPA if LPA=YES is
I        specified as a system initialization parameter. The use of the
I        partition set from the LPA requires that it has been installed
I        there and that the partition set is not named by the PRVMOD
I        start-up option. For more details on this, see the
I        CICS Transaction Server for z/OS Installation Guide.
