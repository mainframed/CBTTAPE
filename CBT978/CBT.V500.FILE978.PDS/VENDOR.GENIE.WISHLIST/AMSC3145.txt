N--------------------------
NCase 15: Resetting All Cache and NVS Operating States to Defaults
N-----------------------------------------------------------------
NSETCACHE REINITIALIZE performs the following:
N
N-> Resets all Storage Control cache and NVS operating states to the
N   initial installation subsystem defaults (in addition all status
N   tracks are reinitialized).
N
N-> Resets all status information to default state.
N
N-> Discards all modified tracks in the cache or NVS. All dual copy
N   logical volumes are set to simplex state and all dual copy logical
N   volumes are reset to simplex. To save the modified data, issue
N   SETCACHE DESTAGE before issuing SETCACHE REINITIALIZE.
N
NBecause of the nature of this command, all volumes in the subsystem
Nmust be varied offline to all attached system images before the command
Nis issued.
N
NAttention: Carefully consider the use of SETCACHE REINITIALIZE before
Nissuing the command and ensure that all data has been destaged to DASD.
NThis command resets all dual copy logical pairs to simplex state and
Nresets the CCA/DDC pointers to their original state.
