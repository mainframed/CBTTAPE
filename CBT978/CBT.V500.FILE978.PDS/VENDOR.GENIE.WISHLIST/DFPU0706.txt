NExample 6: Build a New 3800 Forms Control Buffer Module for
NAdditional ISO Paper Sizes
N-----------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 3
N
NIn this example, an FCB module is defined that uses ISO paper sizes and
Nhas the ISO Paper Sizes Additional Feature installed.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  CH1=1 specifies channel 1 code for line 1, allowing for positioning
N  at line 1.
N
N  Ch12=75 specifies channel 12 code for line 75, allowing for
N  positioning at line 75 and a unit exception indication at 75 (the
N  last printable line on the page.)
N
N  LPI=((10,35),(12,4),(10,35),(6,1)) specifies vertical spacing for
N  the entire printable area on the form. The last printable line on
N  the form must have vertical spacing of 6 lines per inch. The sum of
N  the lines allocated must be a multiple of 1/2.

I  EXAMPLES
I
I  (10,35)=3 1/2"
I  (12,4)=2/6"
I  (10,35)=3 1/2"
I  (6,1)=1/6"
I
I  3 1/2 + 2/6 + 3 1/2 + 1/6 = 7 1/2 which is a multiple of 1/2.
M
M  Kenneth points out that 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 == 1/2.
M
I
N  SIZE=85 specifies the length of the form as 85 tenths of an inch, or
N  8-1/2 inches, although the printable area is 7-1/2 inches.
N
N  The name of the new FCB module is ARU; it is stored as a member of
N  the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
