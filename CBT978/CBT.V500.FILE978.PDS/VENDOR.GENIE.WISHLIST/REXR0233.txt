N=========================
NChapter 2. REXX general concepts
N--------------------------------
N  Assignments and symbols
N  -----------------------
N    Compound symbols
N    ----------------
NA compound symbol permits the substitution of variables within its
Nname when you refer to it. A compound symbol contains at least one
Nperiod and at least two other characters. It cannot start with a digit
Nor a period, and if there is only one period in the compound symbol,
Nit cannot be the last character.
M
MWhen the compound symbol ends with a period it is called a stem.
N
NThe name begins with a stem (that part of the symbol up to and
Nincluding the first period). This is followed by a tail, parts of
Nthe name (delimited by periods) that are constant symbols, simple
Nsymbols, or null. The derived name of a compound symbol is the stem
Nof the symbol, in uppercase, followed by the tail, in which all simple
Nsymbols have been replaced with their values. A tail itself can be
Ncomprised of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and @ # $ " . ! ? and
Nunderscore. The value of a tail can be any character string, including
Nthe null string and strings containing blanks.
N
NExamples:
N---------
NSet a default value:
N--------------------
D  my_stem.1 = 3
D  my_stem.2 = 2
D  Do stemx = 1 to 3
D    Say "my_stem."stemx "=" my_stem.stemx
D  End
N
Nmy_stem.1 = 3
Nmy_stem.2 = 2
Nmy_stem.3 = MY_STEM.3
N
NTAILA: 99
N* )  : STEM.* (
NTAILB: 99
N    14 +++ say stem.* (
NIRX0035I Error running QUICK, line 14: Invalid expression
N
N
NUsing an oddball tail:
N----------------------
D  taila ="* ("
D  stem.taila = 99
D  say "TAILA:" stem.taila /* Displays: 99 */
D  say "* )  :" stem."* (" /* Displays STEM.* ( */
D  stem.tailb = stem.taila
D  say "TAILB:" stem.tailb /* Displays: 99 */
D  /* But the following instruction would cause an error */
D  say stem.* (
* End of WISH.
