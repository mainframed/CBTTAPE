NJCL Command Statement
N=====================
NTwo ways to control command authority are through
NJES initialization parameters and RACF.
N
NPurpose: Use the JCL command statement to enter an MVS operator
Ncommand through the input stream on a JES2 system.
N
IHowever, the COMMAND statement is the preferred way within the
Ijob control language to specify MVS and JES commands.
N
NThis statement should no longer be used.
NIf you find it in use than be intelligent and change it.
N
N// command Ýparameter¨ Ýcomments¨
N
NAs you can see, if your parameters contain a space then using
Nthis statement will fail. What follows the space becomes a
Ncomment.
N
D// DISPLAY TS,LIST
D// D TS,L
N
N The long and short form to display active TSO users.
N
N// F CICS,CEMT INQ TRAN(*)
N
IThe modify command will fail to display transactions as the
Iparameter ends at the space and all that CICS will receive is
Ithe CEMT transaction identifier.
* End of WISH.
