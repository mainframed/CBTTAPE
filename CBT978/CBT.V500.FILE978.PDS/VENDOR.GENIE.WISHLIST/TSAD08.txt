NChapter 8: System trace
N-----------------------
NSystem trace provides an ongoing record of hardware events and software
Nevents occurring during system initialization and operation. The system
Nactivates system tracing at initialization, which runs continuously,
Nunless your installation has changed the IBM-supplied system tracing.
NAfter system initialization, you can use the TRACE operator command on
Na console with master authority to customize system tracing.
N
NSystem trace writes trace data in system trace tables in the trace
Naddress space. System trace maintains a trace table for each processor.
N
NBecause system trace usually runs all the time, it is very useful for
Nproblem determination. While system trace and the generalized trace
Nfacility (GTF) lists many of the same system events, system trace also
Nlists events occurring during system initialization, before GTF tracing
Ncan be started. System trace also traces branches and cross-memory
Ninstructions, which GTF cannot do.
N
NThe following topics explain system trace in detail:
N
N-> Customizing system tracing
N
N-> Receiving system trace data in a dump
N
N-> Formatting system trace data in a dump
N
N-> Reading system trace output
