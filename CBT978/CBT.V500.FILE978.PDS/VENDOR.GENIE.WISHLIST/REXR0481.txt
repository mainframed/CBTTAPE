NBuilt-in functions
N------------------
NSYSVAR
N-------
NSYSVAR returns information about MVS, TSO/E, and the current session,
Nsuch as levels of software available, your logon procedure, and your
Nuser ID. The information returned depends on the arg_name value
Nspecified on the function call. The arg_name values are divided into
Nthe following categories of information: user, terminal, exec, system,
Nlanguage, and console session information. The different categories
Nare described below.
N
N
NSyntax:
D  SYSVAR(arg_name)
I    arg_name: One of:
I      User Information: Use the following arguments to obtain
I                        information related to the user.
I        SYSPREF the prefix as defined in the user profile. The prefix
I                is the string that is prefix to data set names that
I                are not fully-qualified. The prefix is usually the
I                user's user ID. You can use the TSO/E PROFILE command
I                to change the prefix.
N
I        SYSPROC the name of the logon procedure for the current
I                session. You can use the SYSPROC argument to determine
I                whether certain programs, such as the TSO/E Session
I                Manager, are available to the user.
N
I                For example, suppose your installation has the logon
I                procedure SMPROC for the Session Manager. The exec can
I                check that the user logged on using SMPROC before
I                invoking a routine that uses Session Manager.
I                Otherwise, the exec can display a message telling the
I                user to log on using the SMPROC logon procedure.
N
I                SYSPROC returns the following values:
I                -> When the REXX exec is invoked in the foreground
I                   (SYSVAR('SYSENV') returns 'FORE'), SYSVAR('SYSPROC')
I                   will return the name of the current LOGON procedure.
I                -> When the REXX exec is invoked in batch (for example,
I                   from a job submitted by using the SUBMIT command),
I                   SYSVAR('SYSPROC') will return the value 'INIT',
I                ->which is the ID for the initiator.
I                -> When the REXX exec is invoked from a Started Task
I                  (for example, an address space that is started by
I                  using the Start operator command), SYSVAR('SYSPROC')
I                  will return the ID of the started task. If
I                  'S procname' is issued from the operator console,
I                  the SYSVAR('SYSPROC') function will return the value
I                  'procname'.
N
I        SYSUID the user ID under which the current TSO/E session is
I               logged on. The SYSUID argument returns the same value
I               that the USERID built-in function returns in a TSO/E
I               address space.
N
I      Terminal Information: Use the following arguments to obtain
I                            information related to the terminal.
N
I        SYSLTERM number of lines available on the terminal screen. In
I                 the background, SYSLTERM returns 0.
N
I        SYSWTERM width of the terminal screen. In the background,
I                 SYSWTERM returns 132.
N
I      Exec Information: Use the following arguments to obtain
I                        information related to the exec.
N
I        SYSENV indicates whether the exec is running in the foreground
I               or background. SYSENV returns the following values:
I          -> FORE  exec is running in the foreground
I          -> BACK  exec is running in the background
N
I          You can use the SYSENV argument to make logical decisions
I          based on foreground or background processing.
N
I        SYSICMD the name by which the user implicitly invoked the exec
I                that is currently processing. If the user invoked the
I                exec explicitly, SYSICMD returns a null value.
N
I        SYSISPF indicates whether ISPF dialog manager services are
I                available for the exec. SYSISPF returns the following
I                values:
I          -> ACTIVE  ISPF services are available. If the exec was
I                      invoked under ISPF by using the TSOEXEC
I                      interface, no ISPF services are available.
I          -> NOT ACTIVE  ISPF services are not available.
N
I        SYSNEST indicates whether the exec was invoked from another
I                program, such as an exec or CLIST. The invocation could
I                be either implicit or explicit. SYSNEST returns YES if
I                the exec was invoked from another program; otherwise,
I                it returns NO.
N
I        SYSPCMD the name or abbreviation of the TSO/E command processor
I                that the exec most recently processed.
N
I                The initial value that SYSPCMD returns depends on how
I                you invoked the exec. If you invoked the exec using the
I                TSO/E EXEC command, the initial value returned is EXEC.
I                If you invoked the exec using the EXEC subcommand of
I                the TSO/E EDIT command, the initial value returned is
I                EDIT.
N
I                You can use the SYSPCMD argument with the SYSSCMD
I                argument for error and attention processing to
I                determine where an error or attention interrupt
I                occurred.
N
I        SYSSCMD the name or abbreviation of the TSO/E subcommand
I                processor that the exec most recently processed.
N
I                The initial value that SYSSCMD returns depends on how
I                you invoked the exec. If you invoked the exec using
I                the TSO/E EXEC command, the initial value returned is
I                null. If you invoked the exec using the EXEC subcommand
I                of the TSO/E EDIT command, the initial value returned
I                is EXEC.
N
I                The SYSPCMD and SYSSCMD arguments are interdependent.
I                After the initial invocation, the values that SYSPCMD
I                and SYSSCMD return depend on the TSO/E command and
I                subcommand processors that were most recently
I                processed. For example, if SYSSCMD returns the value
I                EQUATE, which is a subcommand unique to the TEST
I                command, the value that SYSPCMD returns would be TEST.
N
I                You can use the SYSPCMD and SYSSCMD arguments for
I                error and attention processing to determine where an
I                error or attention interrupt occurred.
N
I      System Information: Use the following arguments to obtain
I                          information related to the system.
I         SYSCPU the number of seconds of central processing unit (CPU)
I                time used during the session in the form:
I                seconds.hundredths-of-seconds. You can use the SYSCPU
I                argument and the SYSSRV argument, which returns the
I                number of system resource manager (SRM) service units,
I                to evaluate the:
I                -> Performance of applications
I                -> Duration of a session.
N
I        SYSHSM indicates the level of the Data Facility Storage
I               Management Subsystem Hierarchical Storage Manager
I               (DFSMShsm). SYSHSM returns the following values:
I               -> A character string of four two-digit decimal numbers
I                  separated by periods if DFSMShsm for OS/390 V2R10
I                  or higher is active with PTF UW77424 applied. This
I                  represents the four-byte level in the MQCT_VRM field
I                  of the ARCQCT. For example, if DFSMShsm for
I                  OS/390 V2R10 is active with PTF UW77424 applied,
I                  SYSHSM returns: 02.02.10.00
N
I                  Note: For a description of the MQCT_VRM field in the
I                        ARCQCT control block, see OS/390 V2R10.
N
I               -> A character string of four decimal digits if DFSMShsm
I                  before OS/390 V2R10 is installed and active. This
I                  represents the level of DFSMShsm. For example, if
I                  DFSMShsm 1.5.0 is installed and active, SYSHSM
I                  returns: 1050
N
I               -> A null string if the Hierarchical Storage Manager is
I                  not active.
N
I        SYSJES name and level of the JES installed on your system:
I               -> A character string indicating name of the JES plus
I                  its version, release and modification level, for
I                  example: JES2 OS 2.10
I                  where JES2 is the JES name and OS 2.10 is the
I                  JES level. These two strings are separated by a
I                  blank character. If either the JES name or the level
I                  returns an empty character string, then no blank
I                  character is inserted. Trailing blanks are removed.
N
I               -> -INACTIVE- (please note the delimiters) if the
I                  subsystem is not active.
N
I               -> -DOWNLEVEL- (please note the delimiters) if the
I                  subsystem is neither JES2 SP4.3 or later, nor
I                  JES3 SP5.1.1 or later.
N
I        SYSLRACF indicates the level of RACF installed on the system.
I                 If RACF is not installed, SYSLRACF contains a null
I                 value.
N
I        SYSNODE network node name of your installation's JES. This name
I                identifies the local JES in a network of systems or
I                system complexes being used for network job entry
I                (NJE) tasks. The name that is returned derives from
I                the NODE initialization statement of JES.
N
I                The SYSNODE value is returned as either of the
I                following:
I                -> A character string indicating the node name, for
I                   example BOE9.
N
I                -> -INACTIVE- (please note the delimiters) if the
I                   subsystem is not active.
N
I                -> -DOWNLEVEL- (please note the delimiters) if the
I                   subsystem is neither JES2 SP4.3 or later, nor
I                   JES3 SP5.1.1 or later.
N
I        SYSRACF indicates the status of RACF. SYSRACF returns the
I                following values:
I                -> AVAILABLE if RACF is installed and available
N
I                -> NOT AVAILABLE if RACF is installed but is not
I                   available
N
I                -> NOT INSTALLED if RACF is not installed.
N
I        SYSSRV the number of system resource manager (SRM) service
I               units used during the session.
N
I               You can use the SYSSRV argument and the SYSCPU argument,
I               which returns the number of seconds of CPU time used, to
I               evaluate the:
I               -> Performance of applications
I               -> Duration of a session.
N
I        SYSTERMID the terminal ID of the terminal where the REXX exec
I                  was started.
I                  -> A character string indicating the terminal ID.
I                     Trailing blanks are removed.
N
I                  -> A null string if TSO runs in the background.
N
I        SYSTSOE the level of TSO/E installed on the system. For
I                OS/390 Version 2, Release 4 and later, SYSTSOE returns
I                2060.
N
I      Language Information: Use the following arguments to obtain
I                            information related to the display of
I                            information in different languages.
N
I        SYSDTERM indicates whether the user's terminal supports
I                 Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS). SYSDTERM returns
I                 the following values:
I                 -> YES  Terminal supports DBCS
I                 -> NO  Terminal does not support DBCS
N
I                 The SYSDTERM argument is useful if you want to display
I                 messages or other information to the user and the
I                 information contains DBCS characters.
N
I        SYSKTERM indicates whether the user's terminal supports
I                 Katakana. SYSKTERM returns the following values:
I                 -> YES  Terminal supports Katakana
I                 -> NO  Terminal does not support Katakana
N
I                 The SYSKTERM argument is useful if you want to display
I                 messages or other information to the user and the
I                 information contains Katakana characters.
N
I        SYSPLANG a three character code that indicates the user's
I                 primary language stored in the user profile table
I                 (UPT).
N
I        SYSSLANG a three character code that indicates the user's
I                 secondary language stored in the user profile table
I                 (UPT).
N
I      Console Session Information: The console session arguments let
I                                   you obtain information related to
I                                   running an extended MCS console
I                                   session that you have established
I                                   using the TSO/E CONSOLE command.
N
I        The SOLDISP, UNSDISP, SOLNUM, and UNSNUM arguments provide
I        information about the options that have been specified for a
I        console session. The arguments relate to keywords on the TSO/E
I        CONSPROF command. You can use the arguments to determine what
I        options are in effect before you issue MVS system or subsystem
I        commands or use the GETMSG function to retrieve a message.
N
I        SOLDISP indicates whether solicited messages that are routed
I                to a user's console during a console session are to
I                be displayed at the user's terminal. Solicited messages
I                are responses from MVS system and subsystem commands
I                that are issued during a console session.
N
I                SOLDISP returns the following values:
I                -> YES - solicited messages are displayed
I                -> NO - solicited messages are not displayed
N
I        UNSDISP indicates whether unsolicited messages that are routed
I                to a user's console during a console session are to be
I                displayed at the user's terminal. Unsolicited messages
I                are messages that are not direct responses from MVS
I                system and subsystem commands that are issued during a
I                console session.
N
I                UNSDISP returns the following values:
I                -> YES - unsolicited messages are displayed
I                -> NO - unsolicited messages are not displayed
N
I        SOLNUM the size of the message table that contains solicited
I               messages (that is, the number of solicited messages that
I               can be stored). The system stores the messages in the
I               table during a console session if you specify that
I               solicited messages are not to be displayed at the
I               terminal. You can use the TSO/E CONSPROF command to
I               change the size of the table.
N
I               For more information, see z/OS TSO/E System Programming
I               Command Reference.
N
I        UNSNUM the size of the message table that contains unsolicited
I               messages (that is, the number of unsolicited messages
I               that can be stored). The system stores the messages in
I               the table during a console session if you specify that
I               unsolicited messages are not to be displayed at the
I               terminal. You can use the TSO/E CONSPROF command to
I               change the size of the table.
N
I               For more information, see z/OS TSO/E System Programming
I               Command Reference.
N
I        The MFTIME, MFOSNM, MFJOB, and MFSNMJBX arguments provide
I        information about messages that are issued during a console
I        session. These arguments are useful if you use the GETMSG
I        external function to retrieve messages that are not displayed
I        at the terminal and you want to display a particular message
I        that was retrieved. The arguments indicate whether certain
I        types of information should be displayed with the message, such
I        as the time stamp.
N
I        MFTIME indicates whether the user requested that the time stamp
I               should be displayed with system messages.
N
I               MFTIME returns the following values:
I               -> YES  time stamp should be displayed
I               -> NO  time stamp should not be displayed
N
I        MFOSNM indicates whether the user requested that the
I               originating system name should be displayed with system
I               messages.
N
I               MFOSNM returns the following values:
I               -> YES  originating system name should be displayed
I               -> NO  originating system name should not be displayed
N
I        MFJOB indicates whether the user requested that the originating
I              job name or job ID of the issuer should be displayed with
I              system messages.
N
I              MFJOB returns the following values:
I              -> YES  originating job name should be displayed
I              -> NO  originating job name should not be displayed
N
I        MFSNMJBX indicates whether the user requested that the
I                 originating system name and job name should not be
I                 displayed with system messages.
N
I                 MFSNMJBX returns the following values:
I                 -> YES  originating system name and job name should
I                          not be displayed
I                 -> NO  originating system name and job name should be
I                         displayed
N
