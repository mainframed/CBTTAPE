NExample 7: Insert Records into a Library Member
N-----------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a block of three logical records is inserted into an
Nexisting member, and the updated member is placed in the existing
Npartitioned data set.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 DD define the partitioned data set (PDS).
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The CHANGE function statement identifies the input member RENUM. The
N  entire member is listed in the message data set.
N
N  The NUMBER detail statement specifies the insert operation and
N  controls the renumbering operation as described below.
N
N  The data statements are the logical records to be inserted.
N  (Sequence numbers are assigned when the data statements are
N  inserted.)
N
N  In this example, the existing logical records have sequence numbers
N  10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. Sequence numbers are assigned by the NUMBER
N  detail statement, as follows:
N
N  1. Data statement 1 is assigned sequence number 20 (NEW1=20) and
N     inserted after existing logical record 15 (SEQ1=15).
N  2. Data statements 2 and 3 are assigned sequence numbers 25 and 30
N     (INCR=5) and are inserted after data statement 1.
N  3. Existing logical records 20, 25, and 30 are assigned sequence
N     numbers 35, 40, and 45, respectively.
