NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    FILE(ddname) |
D    VOLUME(volser) /* Abbreviation: VOL */ -
D      UNIT(unittype) | -
D    UNITNUMBER(devid) /* Abbreviation: UNUM */ -
I      specifies the volume of a unit within the subsystem.
N
I      FILE(ddname): specifies the name of a DD statement that
I        identifies the device type and volume of a unit within the
I        subsystem. For ddname, substitute the name of the DD statement
I        identifying the device type.

I        serial number of a volume within the subsystem.
N
I        UNIT(unittype): specifies the unit type of the subsystem.
N
I      UNITNUMBER(devid) /* Abbreviation: UNUM */: is the MVS device
I        number. The UNITNUMBER parameter is only accepted with the
I        following:
N
I        DEVICE ON or OFF
I        SUBSYSTEM OFF
I        NVS OFF
I        DASDFASTWRITE ON or OFF or PENDINGOFF
I        DISCARDPINNED

I        CACHEFASTWRITE
N
I        Note: The UNITNUMBER parameter cannot be used for an online
I        device in the "Intervention Required" state.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    DEVICE | /* Abbreviation: DEV */ -
D    SUBSYSTEM | /* Abbreviations: SUBSYS | SSYS */ -
D    NVS | -
D    DASDFASTWRITE | /* Abbreviations: DFW | DASDFW */ -
D    CACHEFASTWRITE /* Abbreviations: CFW | CACHEFW */ -
I      specifies whether the command pertains to caching for a specific
I      device or subsystem caching, nonvolatile storage, DASD fast
I      write to a specific device, or cache fast write access for the
I      subsystem.
N
I      DEVICE /* Abbreviation: DEV */: specifies that access to the
I        cache for a particular device is allowed or prohibited.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. DEVICE OFF is not supported for the ESS.
N
I        2. DEVICE ON or OFF can be issued to an offline device by
I           using the UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
I      SUBSYSTEM /* Abbreviations: SUBSYS | SSYS */: specifies that
I        access to cache for the subsystem is allowed or prohibited.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. SUBSYSTEM OFF is not supported for the ESS.
N
I        2. SUBSYSTEM OFF can be issued to an offline device by using
I           the UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
I        3. READ access authority to the RACF FACILITY class resource
I           STGADMIN.IDC.SETCACHE.SUBSYSTEM is required to use the
I           SUBSYSTEM parameter.
N
I        Attention: When cache operation is restored,
I        SETCACHE RESETTODUPLEX must be issued for each suspended duplex
I        pair in the subsystem.
N
I      NVS: specifies that access to the nonvolatile storage is allowed
I        or prohibited.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. NVS OFF is not supported for the ESS.
N
I        2. NVS OFF can be issued to an offline device by using the
I           UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
I      DASDFASTWRITE /* Abbreviations: DFW | DASDFW */: specifies that
I        DASD fast write to a particular device is allowed or
I        prohibited.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. DASDFASTWRITE OFF is not supported for the ESS.
N
I        2. DASDFASTWRITE ON or OFF or PENDINGOFF can be issued to an
I           offline device by using the UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
I      CACHEFASTWRITE /* Abbreviations: CFW | CACHEFW */: specifies that
I        cache fast write for the subsystem is allowed or prohibited.
N
D    ON | -
D    OFF | -
D    PENDINGOFF /* Abbreviation: PEND */ -
I      specifies whether access is allowed or prohibited.
N
I      ON: specifies that access is allowed.
N
I      OFF:specifies that access is prohibited.
N
I        Note: Setting cache on or off for the subsystem and setting
I        cache on or off for a device are independent operations. That
I        is, cache can be set on or off for individual devices whether
I        the cache is on or off for the subsystem. However, if the cache
I        is set off for the subsystem, setting cache on for an
I        individual device has no effect until the cache is set on for
I        the subsystem.
N
I      PENDINGOFF /* Abbreviation: PEND */: specifies a recovery command
I        to allow cache or DASD fast write to a particular device to be
I        set off when cache or DASD fast write is in pending state.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. This parameter should only be used as a last resort because
I           no destage occurs and data could be lost.
N
I        2. The PENDINGOFF parameter must be used with either SUBSYSTEM
I           or DASDFASTWRITE, and is accepted only if SUBSYSTEM OFF or
I           DASDFASTWRITE OFF failed. That is, when the PENDINGOFF
I           parameter is used with DASDFASTWRITE, the device must be in
I           the DEACTIVATION PENDING state. When the PENDINGOFF
I           parameter is used with SUBSYSTEM, the subsystem must be in
I           the DEACTIVATION FAILED state (see LISTDATA STATUS).
I           Otherwise, the command is rejected.
N
I        3. PENDINGOFF is not available for NVS. If NVS OFF does not
I           obtain the desired result, issue a DASDFASTWRITE PENDINGOFF
I           to each device where DASD fast write is in a deactivation
I           pending state. NVS OFF should then work.
N
D    SUBCHSET(n) -
I      Specifies the subchannel set number from 0 to 3 that the device
I      number specified with the UNITNUMBER resides in. Valid with the
I      CACHEFASTWRITE optional parameter when the UNITNUMBER parameter
I      is used.
N
I      n: Specifies the subchannel set number from 0 to 3 that the
I        device number specified with the UNITNUMBER resides in.
N
NSpecial Purpose Optional Parameters
N-----------------------------------
MThe following parameters are not to be issued concurrently with the
Moptional parameters described previously, or with each other, unless
Motherwise noted.
M
M    DISCARDPINNED | /* Abbreviation: DPIN */ -
M    DESTAGE | /* Abbreviation: DESTG */ -
M    REINITIALIZE | /* Abbreviations: RINIT | REINIT */ -
M    SETSECONDARY(devid) | /* Abbreviation: SSEC */ -
M    SUSPENDPRIMARY | /* Abbreviations: SUSPRI | SPPRI */ -
M    SUSPENDSECONDARY | /* Abbreviations: SUSSEC | SPSEC */ -
M    RESETTODUPLEX | /* Abbreviations: RESETDUP | REDUP */ -
M    REESTABLISHDUPLEX(devid) | /* Abbreviation: REEST */ -
M    RESETTOSIMPLEX /* Abbreviations: RESETSIM | RESIM */ -
I      specifies operations pertaining to dual copy.
N
I      DISCARDPINNED /* Abbreviation: DPIN */: specifies that all pinned
I        cache fast write data and DASD fast write data for the
I        specified volume is discarded.
N
I        Note: DISCARDPINNED can be issued to an offline device by using
I        the UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
I      DESTAGE /* Abbreviation: DESTG */: specifies that a destage to
I        DASD of all modified tracks in the cache and NVS is to be
I        scheduled.
N
I      REINITIALIZE /* Abbreviations: RINIT | REINIT */: causes a cached
I        Storage Control subsystem to unconditionally establish or
I        reestablish all caching status on the subsystem status devices.
I        (This is a reconfiguration of the subsystem, setting all
I        caching status to its default values.) REINITIALIZE requires
I        the use of the UNITNUMBER parameter, because all devices must
I        be offline before the command is executed.
N
I        REINITIALIZE also resets all CCAs and DDCs to the initial
I        installation values (direct translation).
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. The REINITIALIZE parameter terminates dual copy logical
I           volumes (duplex pairs).
N
I        2. Ensure that other operating systems are not accessing the
I           target subsystem before using the REINITIALIZE command.
N
I        3. The REINITIALIZE parameter causes pinned data to be lost.
N
I      SETSECONDARY(devid) /* Abbreviation: SSEC */: specifies that a
I        dual copy (duplex) pair is to be established. The secondary
I        volume must be offline and is identified by its devid (devid
I        is the MVS device number). DASD fast write and caching status
I        of the primary volume are maintained for the duplex pair.
N
I        devid: is the MVS device number.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. This parameter is not supported for the ESS.
N
I        2. With this parameter, the JCL JOB statement should include
I           'TIME=1440'.
N
I        3. This parameter may be used in conjunction with COPY (with
I           or without PACE) or NOCOPY.
N
I        4. During the process of establishing a duplex pair, caching
I           for the primary volume is temporarily deactivated.
N
I        5. When you use dual copy to migrate from 3390 devices to
I           RAMAC devices, an invalid format 4 DSCB is created on the
I           target device. Use ICKDSF to fix the format 4 DSCB. See
I           your IBM representative for the latest service level of
I           ICKDSF that provides this function.
N
M           2018-03-22 A GOOGLE search hints R17 AND run ICKDSF BUILDIX
M           to rebuild it.
N
I        Device level caching, for both primary and secondary devices,
I        is set to off to force data destaging. It is set back to on,
I        automatically by software, after the dual copy operation
I        completes.
N
I        The software can be overridden by IDCAMS allowing cache to be
I        set on after the establishment of a duplex pair has been
I        initiated (verify with a DEVSERV command that status is pending
I        for primary device before setting device cache to on).
N
I      SUSPENDPRIMARY /* Abbreviations: SUSPRI | SPPRI */: suspends the
I        primary volume of a duplex pair. The subsystem swaps the
I        primary and secondary volumes of the duplex pair. The suspended
I        device is the secondary address. DASD fast write status and
I        caching status are maintained.
N
I        Note: This parameter is not supported for the ESS.
N
I      SUSPENDSECONDARY /* Abbreviations: SUSSEC | SPSEC */: suspends
I        the secondary volume of a duplex pair. DASD fast write status
I        and caching status are maintained.
N
I        Note: This parameter is not supported for the ESS.
N
I      RESETTODUPLEX /* Abbreviations: RESETDUP | REDUP */:
I        establishes a duplex pair from a suspended duplex pair. The
I        subsystem always attempts to match channel connection addresses
I        (CCAs) and director-to-device connection (DDC) addresses, and
I        swaps the devices after synchronization if a swap would result
I        in a match. If the pair is swapped, all data in the cache is
I        invalidated. DASD fast write status and caching status are
I        maintained.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. This parameter is not supported for the ESS.
N
I        2. With this parameter, the JCL JOB statement should include
I           'TIME=1440'.
N
I        3. COPY and PACE can be used in conjunction with this
I           parameter.
N
I      REESTABLISHDUPLEX(devid) /* Abbreviation: REEST */: reestablishes
I        a duplex pair from the primary volume in a suspended duplex
I        pair and the user-specified alternate device. DASD fast write
I        status and caching status are maintained.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. This parameter is not supported for the ESS.
N
I        2. With this parameter, the JCL JOB statement should include
I           'TIME=1440'.
N
I        3. COPY and PACE can be used in conjunction with this
I           parameter.
N
I      RESETTOSIMPLEX /* Abbreviations: RESETSIM | RESIM */: terminates
I        a duplex pair. When the volumes are changed from a duplex pair
I        to simplex volumes, the old primary volume retains the DASD
I        fast write and the device caching status of the duplex pair.
I        For the old secondary volume, DASD fast write becomes inactive
I        and device caching becomes active (reverts to default status).
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. This parameter is not supported for the ESS.
N
I        2. RESETTOSIMPLEX can be issued to an offline device by using
I           the UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
M    COPY | -
M    NOCOPY -
I      specifies whether or not the Storage Control is to copy the
I      primary volume onto the secondary volume when establishing a
I      duplex pair (used only with the SETSECONDARY parameter).
N
I      COPY: specifies that the Storage Control is to copy the primary
I        volume onto the secondary when establishing a duplex pair
I        (SETSECONDARY). (Copy can be used with the RESETTODUPLEX and
I        the REESTABLISHDUPLEX parameters.)
N
I        Note: Specify the COPY parameter, except for pairs of primary
I        and secondary volumes that have just been initialized by ICKDSF
I        using the same initialization parameters.
N
I      NOCOPY: specifies that the primary and secondary volumes are
I        identical and the Storage Control does not need to copy the
I        primary volume onto the secondary to establish the duplex pair
I        (used only with SETSECONDARY; cannot be used with
I        REESTABLISHDUPLEX or RESETTODUPLEX).
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. The subsystem keeps an indication that the duplex pair was
I           established using an internal copy. If an error results
I           because the two volumes are not identical, this indicator
I           is checked. The message given as a result of the
I           out-of-synchronization condition indicates if an internal
I           copy was done or that the out-of-synchronization condition
I           is caused by a probable user error.
N
I        2. Specify only the NOCOPY parameter when both the primary and
I           secondary volumes have been initialized with ICKDSF, using
I           the same initialization parameters, and contain no
I           application data.
N
I        3. Just as the parameter name suggests, nothing is copied from
I           the primary to the secondary.
N
M    PACE(n)
I      specifies the number of tracks from 1 to 255 that are to be
I      copied without interruption during the Storage Control copy
I      operation to establish a duplex pair (SETSECONDARY); to establish
I      a duplex pair from a suspended duplex pair (RESETTODUPLEX); or
I      to reestablish a duplex pair from the primary of a suspended
I      pair and a user-specified alternate (REESTABLISHDUPLEX).
N
I      Specifying PACE(0) defines an uninterruptible (dedicated) copy
I        operation.
N
I      Specifying PACE(1) to PACE (255) defines the number of tracks to
I        copy before releasing the device for any outstanding device
I        activity (when there is no more activity, the copy of the next
I        n tracks resumes). The default is 15 tracks.
N
I      Note: Specify PACE(1) or (2) for optimum device availability.
I      Using PACE(0) or a large PACE value may lock out other activity
I      to the volume for a long time.
