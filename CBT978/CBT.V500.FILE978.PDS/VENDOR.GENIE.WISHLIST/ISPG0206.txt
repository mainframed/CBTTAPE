N-------------------------------------------
NDISPLAY-Display panels and messages
N-----------------------------------
NThe DISPLAY service retrieves a panel definition, performs any
Npre-display processing specified on the panel definition, initializes
Nvariable panel fields from the corresponding dialog variables, and
Ndisplays the panel on the screen. A message can optionally be displayed
Nwith the panel. If the optional message is to be displayed in a message
Npop-up window, the position of the message pop-up window can be
Nindicated by the MSGLOC parameter.
N
NNote: When running in GUI mode, the MSGLOC parameter is ignored.
N
NAfter the panel has been displayed, you can enter information and
Npress the Enter key. All input fields are automatically stored into
Ndialog variables of the same name, and the )PROC section of the panel
Ndefinition is then processed. If any condition occurs that causes a
Nmessage to be displayed (verification failure, MSG=value condition in
Na TRANS, or explicit setting of .MSG), processing continues to the
N)HELP or )END section. The )REINIT section is then processed if it is
Npresent. The panel is then redisplayed with the first, or only, message
Nthat was encountered.
N
NWhen the user presses the Enter key again, all input fields are stored
Nand the )PROC section is again processed. This sequence continues until
Nthe entire )PROC section has been processed without any message
Nconditions being encountered. The panel display service finally
Nreturns, with a return code of 0, to the dialog function that
Ninvoked it.
N
NAlternatively, when a panel is displayed, the user can enter a CANCEL,
NEND, EXIT, or RETURN command. If the input fields are not in a
Nscrollable area, they are stored and the )PROC section is processed. In
Nscrollable areas, only the input fields that have been displayed will
Nbe stored. No messages are displayed, even if a MSG condition is
Nencountered. The panel display service then returns to the dialog
Nfunction with a return code of 8.

NCommand invocation format
N-------------------------
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "DISPLAY" ,
D    "PANEL(panel-name)" ,
I      Specifies the name of the panel to be displayed.
N
D    "MSG(message-id)" ,
I      Specifies the identification of a message to be displayed on
I      the panel.
N
D    "CURSOR(cursor-field-name)" ,
I      Specifies the name of the field where the cursor is to be
I      placed.
N
I      If cursor-position is specified both by this parameter and by
I      setting the control variable .CURSOR in the )INIT or )REINIT
I      section of the panel being displayed, the value in .CURSOR
I      overrides this parameter.
N
D    "CSRPOS(cursor-position)" ,
I      Specifies the character position within the field where the
I      cursor is to be placed. This position applies regardless of
I      whether the initial cursor placement was specified in the CURSOR
I      calling sequence parameter, the .CURSOR control variable in the
I      )INIT or )REINIT section of a panel, or is the result of default
I      cursor placement. If cursor-position is not specified or is not
I      within the field, the default is 1.
N
I      If cursor-position is specified both by this parameter and by
I      setting the control variable .CSRPOS in the )INIT or )REINIT
I      section of the panel being displayed, the value in .CSRPOS
I      overrides this parameter.
N
D    "COMMAND(stack-buffer-name)" ,
I      Specifies the name of a variable containing the chain of
I      commands passed by the dialog to ISPF for execution. The maximum
I      length of the actual command chain within this variable is 255.
N
D    "RETBUFFR(ret-buffer-name)" ,
I      Specifies the name of a variable in which the unprocessed portion
I      of the command chain is stored should an error occur before the
I      complete chain is processed. This includes the command being
I      processed when the error is detected.
N
D    "RETLGTH(ret-length-name)" ,
I      Specifies the name of a variable in which the length of the
I      unprocessed portion of the command chain is stored should an
I      error occur before the complete chain is processed. This includes
I      the command being processed when the error was detected.
N
D    "MSGLOC(message-field-name)"
I      Used to position the message pop-up window. If the application
I      specifies this parameter, the dialog manager positions the
I      message pop-up relative to the named field.
N
I      If this parameter is omitted and a message is displayed in a
I      message pop-up window, the window is displayed at the bottom of
I      the logical screen or below the active ADDPOP pop-up window if
I      one exists.
N
I      For compatibility with later versions, this parameter should be
I      specified only when the message will display in a pop-up window.
N
I      Note: When running in GUI mode, this parameter is ignored.
N
NReturn codes
N------------
NThese return codes are possible:
N
D  display_rc = RC
D  SELECT
D    WHEN (display_rc = 0) THEN DO
D      /* Normal completion.
D
D         For the COMMAND option, the ret-buffer-name is set to blanks
D         and the ret-length-name is set to zero. Passing an empty
D         command chain buffer also results in a normal completion. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (display_rc = 4) THEN DO
D      /* One or more commands in the stack could not be found in the
D         active set of command tables. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (display_rc = 8) THEN DO
D      /* User requested termination using the END or RETURN command.
D         If CANCEL and EXIT are requested from a panel displayed using
D         the DISPLAY service call and the panel was defined with the
D         dialog tag language (DTL), the dialog manager returns the
D         command in ZVERB and sets a return code of 8 from the display
D         screen. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (display_rc = 12) THEN DO
D      /* The specified panel, message, message location field, or
D         cursor field could not be found. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to define the missing entity."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (display_rc = 16) THEN DO
D      /* Truncation or translation error in storing defined
D         variables. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the variable."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (display_rc = 20) THEN DO
D      /* Severe error. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the DISPLAY statement."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    OTHERWISE DO
D      SAY "Something very unexpected happened, RC("display_rc")."
D    END
D  END

NUsing the COMMAND Option
N------------------------
NThe COMMAND option allows a dialog to pass a chain of commands in the
Nvariable specified by stack-buffer-name to ISPF for execution. The
Npanel specified on the DISPLAY service request is processed in CONTROL
NNONDISPL ENTER mode. In addition, when ENTER is simulated by ISPF, the
Ncommand chain is executed as though it were either entered on the
Ncommand line of the panel by the user or entered through a function
Nkey. When the command chain is exhausted or one of the commands cannot
Nbe found in the active set of command tables, processing terminates
Nand control returns directly to the dialog that issued the DISPLAY
NCOMMAND call, except for those specific error conditions described
Nfurther on in the manual.
N
