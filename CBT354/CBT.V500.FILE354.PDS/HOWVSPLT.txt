-          The program VSPLIT is used to process data  in  a  variable

           VSPLIT can be used to split records from a variable length file
           to a SYSOUT file or to another variable length file.
           VSPLIT can also be used to create a fixed length file from a
           variable length file.

+                              ___

           To execute VSPLIT the following JCL is required:

           //jobname    JOB
           //STEPNAME   EXEC PGM=VSPLIT,REGION=60K
           //STEPLIB    DD   DSN=SYS9.UTIL.LOAD,DISP=SHR
           //SYSPRINT   DD   SYSOUT=A
           //TAPEIN     DD   DSN=....etc.
           //OUT1
           //OUT7
           //SYSIN      DD  *
           control cards
           //

           The OUT1 to OUT7 DD cards are:
           //OUT1       DD  SYSOUT=A
           //OUT2       DD  SYSOUT=A
           //OUT3       DD  SYSOUT=A
           //OUT4       DD  DSN=, UNIT=, DISP=, SPACE=, DCB=
           //OUT5       DD  ''
           //OUT6       DD  ''
           //OUT7       DD  ''

           For OUT4, OUT5, OUT6:
           DSN= Any name up to 44 characters long consisting of
                1-8 chars.1-8 chars.etc

           UNIT= TAPE for tape
                 USER  for permanent disk files
                 SYSDA   for temporary files

           DISP= (,CATLG) for permanent files
                 (,PASS)  for temporary files

           SPACE= Is required only if UNIT=SYSDA or USER is specified.
                 (TRK,(nbr of trks,3),RLSE)
                 nbr of trks depends on the number of records being split.
                 if BLKSIZE=3532, there will be 5 blocks per track on a
                 3350, so 100 blocks would need 20 tracks.
           DCB=  (LRECL=rec len+4,BLKSIZE=(rec len+4)*blk factor)+4)
                 eg- if rec len = 1760 and blk factor = 2,
                 LRECL=1764,BLKSIZE=3532

                 If DCB information is left off OUT4 - OUT7 DCB's, it will
                 default to the DCB information of the input file.

           For OUT7:
           DCB=  (RECFM=FB,LRECL=rec len,BLKSIZE=rec len*blk factor)
                 the VB file is reblocked to the rec len specified in
                 the LRECL=. If the FB LRECL is larger than the VB LRECL,
                 the FB record is padded with blanks.

                               CONTROL CARDS
+                              _______ _____

           VSPLIT is controlled by the following control cards:
 |         Comments can now be included in the control statements.
 |         Any statement with * or / in column 1 is ignored.

 |         START=RDW or HEX
 |         * THIS IS A COMMENT
           INPUT=TAPEIN,CONTROL=(CF1 control data,....CF5 control data)
           OUTPUT=OUT1,OUT2,.....OUT7
           START=RDW
           SELECT=OUT1,CF1=,......CF5=
           HEAD1=
           HEAD2=
           HEAD3=

           The INPUT= statement is used to set up the selection criteria
           for the 1 to 5 control fields.

           The OUTPUT= statement determines which of the 7 output
           files will be used.

 |         The START=HEX statement indicates that the search starts
 |                       at offset 0(the record length field) and that
 |                       the start position is in hexadecimal.
 |                NOTE...the hex start position uses 2 chars..eg..05.
 |
 |         The START=RDW statement indicates that the search starts
 |                       at offset 0(the record length field) and that
 |                       the start position is in decimal.
 |
 |         If  START=RDW or START=HEX is not specified, the search
 |                       starts at offset 5(the record data) and the
 |                       start position is in decimal.

           The SELECT= statement is used to determine which output
           file will receive the data selected by the specified 1
           to 5 control fields.

           The HEAD1= statement is used to change the default heading
           on the OUT1 listing.

           The HEAD2= statement is used to change the default heading
           on the OUT2 listing.

           The HEAD3= statement is used to change the default heading
           on the OUT3 listing.

           The following RESTRICTIONS must be observed:

           OUT1, OUT2, OUT3 can only be SYSOUT=A files.

           OUT4, OUT5, OUT6 can only be VB files on TAPE or DISK.

           OUT7 can only be an FB file on TAPE or DISK.

           On the OUTPUT= card, the OUT's must be in sequence.

           There can be 1 to 5 control fields in the CONTROL=(start,length,type)
           parameter.

           START
           START is the starting position within the record.
           If the START position is outside the length of the VB record,
           it is treated the same as condition not met.

           LENGTH
           LENGTH is the number of characters in the field.

           The maximum length allowed for alphanumeric fields is 111.

           The maximum length allowed for packed or hexadecimal fields is 16.

           For packed fields, the length is the number of digits in the
           field, not the number of bytes in the field...eg...a 2 byte
           packed field will hold 3 digits...123c, so the length is 3, not 2.

           To specify a positive(+) or a negative(-) packed number, the last
           digit must consist of the number and a 12 or 11 punch. This can
           be accomplished by using the character '{' (x'c0') and the letters
           'A - I' to designate +0 to +9  or the character '}' (x'd0') and the
           letters 'J - R' to designate -0 to -9. For example, to select +1230,
           you would code 123{, and to select -1230 you would code 123}. To
           select +1234 you would code 123D, and to select -1879, you would
           code 187R.
           The corresponding letters for the positive and negative numbers are:
                +0 = {            -0 = }
                +1 = A            -1 = J
                +2 = B            -2 = K
                +3 = C            -3 = L
                +4 = D            -4 = M
                +5 = E            -5 = N
                +6 = F            -6 = O
                +7 = G            -7 = P
                +8 = H            -8 = Q
                +9 = I            -9 = R

           For hexadecimal fields, the length is a multiple of 2, as it takes
           2 digits to represent 1 hexadecimal digit...eg...x'12' would be
           12 in your control field, so the length is 2, not 1.

           TYPE
           the TYPE specified can be 1 of the following:
           'A' to indicate alphanumeric data,
           'P' to indicate packed data,
           'H' to indicate hexadecimal data.

           There can be 1 to 5 SELECT statements for each OUT file.

           Records can be selected on:
             1- All conditions           - CF1=ALL,...CF5=...
             2- Equal conditions         - CF1=(= ),...CF5=...
             3- Greater than conditions  - CF1=(> ),...CF5=...
             4- Less than conditions     - CF1=(< ),...CF5=...
             5- Not equal conditions     - CF1=(# ),...CF5=...

           The ability to put a heading on OUT1, OUT2, OUT3 has been included.
           The control cards are:
           HEAD1=
           HEAD2=
           HEAD3=
           The headings can be 1-74 characters long. If heading cards are not
           included, the defaults are:
              HEAD1=RECORDS SPLIT TO OUT1
              HEAD2=RECORDS SPLIT TO OUT2
              HEAD3=RECORDS SPLIT TO OUT3
