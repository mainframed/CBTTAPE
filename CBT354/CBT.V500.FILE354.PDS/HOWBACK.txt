   08     Oct    1998  Eighth issue ...Because of DFSMSRMM, the        |
                       SYSUT2 dsn will again be used to create the     |
                       backup dataset names. The name on tape will     |
                       be the SYSUT2 DSN= with F001, F002, etc.        |
                       added to the end to make a unique name. If      |
                       the SYSUT2 dsn is too long, it will be          |
                       shortened until it is valid.                    |
                       The layout of the //RESTORE record had to be    |
                       increased because of this.                      |
.bx
   07     Aug    1997..Seventh issue ...Added 'IEBCOPY' parm to
                       force use of IEBCOPY, not PDSFAST, as PDSFAST
                       doesn't work under Y2K...
                       Use //STEPLIB of IMSVS.AUTHLIB1 rather than
                       HALL.LINKLIB to avoid IEBCOPY error messages.
                     ..If a //OUTDCB as well as a //DEBUG dd is used,
                       a dump of DCB's and JFCB's will occur.
.bx
   06     Sept   1996  Sixth issue ...documentation revision with
                       information on cataloging the 1st file.
                       See JCL COMMENTS for SYSUT2..
                       Also add more documentation on PARMs...
.bx
   05     June   1996  Fifth issue ...This revision uses the SYSUT2
                       DD information to create the first file on
                       the tape. This was necessary to use expiry
                       dates after system changes sometime before
                       June, 1996. The DSN can now be used to catalog
                       the backup tape. Also, the DSN must be a valid
                       dataset name. NONE is no longer valid if RACF
                       does dsn checking. The SYSUT2 dsn will no longer
                       be used to create the backup dataset names. The
                       name on tape will be the same as the disk file
                       name.
                       There is no FILE 0001 in the //REPORT listing.
                       It is now a control dataset created from the
                       //SYSUT2 jcl parameters.

:h1.       Introduction

 The program BACKDSNS is used to backup datasets to tape, based on
 the dataset names contained in the //DSNS control stream.

 The program BACKDSNS is used to restore datasets from tape,
 based on the dataset names contained in the //DSNS control stream.

 BACKDSNS is written using standard IBM macros, and should run on
 any IBM mainframe running MVS software in 24 bit mode with RACF
 installed.
 Any IBM compatible disk or tape drive should be accessible.


 SEQUENTIAL datasets are copied using QSAM.
            IEBGENER could be used to restore these datasets.

 PARTITIONED datasets are copied using PDSFAST.
            PDSFAST could be used to restore these datasets.

 DIRECT access datasets are copied sequentially using QSAM.
            A BDAM load program would have to be used to
            restore these datasets.

 VSAM datasets are copied using IDCAMS EXPORT TEMPORARY.
            IDCAMS IMPORT could be used to restore these datasets.



 IEBGENER and IDCAMS are IBM utility programs.
 RACF is an IBM security system.
 PDSFAST is a Software Engineering of America utility program.




:h1. Program Description
BACKDSNS reads a dataset name from //DSNS to determine what dataset
to copy to the //SYSUT2 output tape.

The dataset is dynamically allocated to //SYSUT1 and is checked to see
if it is empty and if RACF will allow read access.

Selected datasets are copied to tape and a listing is produced showing
the disk dataset name, tape file number, tape volume serial number(s),
and tape dataset name for each disk dataset backed up.

An optional //RESTORE dataset can be produced showing the disk dataset
name, dataset type, tape volume serial number(s), tape file sequence
number, dcb information, disk volume, and tape dataset name.           |
The primary purpose of this file is to contain information needed to
restore the dataset.

Note that from version 5 up, the first dataset is not shown in the     |
//RESTORE file, as it is now used just for system information.


If this is a RESTORE operation, the data in //DSNS must be the data
created in the //RESTORE dataset in the backup job.
If the dataset does not exist, a new one will be created based on the
restore information.
If the dataset is a PDS, the directory will be erased before the copy
is done.
DIRECT access (BDAM) datasets CANNOT be restored with BACKDSNS. They
MUST be restored using a program specifically designed for the data.


The //SYSUT2 DCB attributes are set as follows:

 SEQUENTIAL datasets:
            BLKSIZE = SYSUT1 blksize
              LRECL = SYSUT1 lrecl
              RECFM = SYSUT1 recfm

 PARTITIONED datasets:
    PDSFAST BLKSIZE = 19089
              LRECL = 19085
              RECFM = VS

 DIRECT access datasets:
            BLKSIZE = SYSUT1 blksize or 32767 if blksize=0
              LRECL = SYSUT1 lrecl or blksize if lrecl=0
              RECFM = SYSUT1 recfm or U if no sysut1 recfm

:h2. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION, continued...
 VSAM datasets:
     EXPORT BLKSIZE = 23220
              LRECL = 516
              RECFM = VBS

For a more detailed description of the above DCB attributes, see the
IBM JCL manual.

If SYSUT2 becomes a multi-volume file, check the JOBLOG as well as
the REPORT file to make sure you have the volume serial numbers of
all the tapes used to backup/restore the disk datasets.


:h1. Program Parameters

BACKDSNS allows the following parameters:

    IEBCOPY...Use IEBCOPY, not PDSFAST to copy partitioned datasets.
              As of August 12, 1997, our version of PDSFAST cannot
              copy tapes created under the current date to a Y2K date.
              Use //STEPLIB of IMSVS.AUTHLIB1 rather than
              HALL.LINKLIB to avoid IEBCOPY error messages.

    RESTORE...This tells BACKDSNS that this is a restore run.

       VOL=...For a RESTORE run, all datasets that do not already
              exist will be allocated on the specified volume(s).
              Up to 4 volumes can be specified, as VOL=(v1,v2...).

      UNIT=...For a RESTORE run, all datasets that do not already
              exist will be allocated to the specified UNIT.
              The default is UNIT=SYSDA.

       KEEP...For a RESTORE run, all datasets created during a
              RESTORE will not be cataloged.

      ALLOC...When gathering size statistics, use allocated space,
              not used space.

     TUNIT=...For a RESTORE run, specify tape unit
              The default is TUNIT=TAPE.

:h1. Backup Jcl Example

The following JCL is required to run BACKDSNS to backup files:

//*
//*    backup datasets to tape
//*
//BACKDSNS EXEC PGM=BACKDSNS,REGION=4000K
//STEPLIB  DD DSN=HALL.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
//REPORT   DD SYSOUT=*               FOR AUDIT TRAIL
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*               FOR PDSFAST/COPY
//SYSABEND DD SYSOUT=*               for a dump, if needed
//DEBUG    DD SYSOUT=*               for an internal module trace
//OUTDCB   DD SYSOUT=*               for a DCB/JFCB trace
//RESTORE  DD DSN=hli.RESTORE,       for a list of DSNS
//            DISP=SHR                    LRECL must be 200            |
//SYSUT2   DD DSN=hli.BACKUP,

//*
        //DSNS is the list of dataset names to be backed up.....
               The DSN starts in column 1, and if specified,
               the VOLSER is in column 46.
               An asterisk (*) in column 1 is a comment.               |

:h1. Restore Jcl Example

The following JCL is required to run BACKDSNS to restore files:

//*
//*    restore datasets from tape
//*
//BACKDSNS EXEC PGM=BACKDSNS,PARM=RESTORE,REGION=4000K
//STEPLIB  DD DSN=HALL.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
//REPORT   DD SYSOUT=*               FOR AUDIT TRAIL
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*               FOR PDSFAST/COPY
//SYSABEND DD SYSOUT=*               for a dump, if needed
//DEBUG    DD SYSOUT=*               for an internal module trace
//OUTDCB   DD SYSOUT=*               for a DCB/JFCB trace
//DSNS     DD DSN=hli.RESTORE,       for a list of DSNS to RESTORE
//            DISP=SHR                   LRECL must be 200             |
//*YSUT1   DD UNIT=(TAPE,,DEFER)     TO GET A TAPE DRIVE
//SYSUT1   DD  DSN=the name you used on the backup,
//             UNIT=(TAPE,,DEFER),VOL=SER=the volser,
//             DATACLAS=TAPEONLY,
//             DISP=(OLD,KEEP),
//             LABEL=(1,SL,EXPDT=99365) may not be needed...
//SYSIN    DD *
 COPY  I=SYSUT1,O=SYSUT2
/*
    or, if the control statement is in a dataset:
//SYSIN    DD DSN=dsname,DISP=OLD
//*
//

:h1. Rename dataset at restore

All datasets can be renamed at restore time EXCEPT vsam files.
To rename a dataset, change the name in the RESTORE file, columns 1-44.

To rename a VSAM file, you must use IDCAMS, with the NEWNAME option.
The following jcl is an example of how to RENAME a VSAM file at
restore time:

     //*
     //*   RESTORE A VSAM FILE, AND RENAME ALL ENTRIES
     //*
     //STEP1    EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
     //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
     //SYSUT1   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=vsam.name.in.restore.file,UNIT=TAPE,
     //             VOL=SER=volser,LABEL=(seqno)
     //SYSIN DD *
          IMPORT INFILE(SYSUT1) -
                    OUTDATASET(new.vsam.csi.name) -
                    INTOEMPTY -
                    OBJECTS( -
                                 (old.vsam.csi.name     -
                          NEWNAME(new.vsam.csi.name))   -
                                 (old.vsam.data.name    -
                          NEWNAME(new.vsam.data.name))  -
                                 (old.vsam.index.name   -
                          NEWNAME(new.vsam.index.name)) -
                           )
     //

Note...The dsn, volser, and seqno in the //SYSUT1 is obtained from
       the //RESTORE file created when you backed up the files....

:h2. JCL COMMENTS

The STEPLIB  DD statement is not required if the BACKDSNS program is
                in a system linklist library.

The REPORT   DD statement will contain information on backed up or
                restored datasets.

The SYSPRINT DD statement will contain a list of members for PO datasets
                and the output from any IDCAMS calls for VSAM backups.
                The SYSPRINT statement could be DUMMY if a list of
                members is not required.

The DEBUG    DD statement will produce an internal trace of the program,
                and is used for error determination.
                The DEBUG statement is optional.

The OUTDCB   DD statement will produce an internal trace of the DCB and
                JFCB control blocks for SYSUT1 and SYSUT2.
                This is used for error determination.
                The OUTDCB statement is optional. If specified, the
                the DEBUG statement must also be specified.

The RESTORE  DD statement will contain a list of backed up datasets
                that can be used for restoring datasets.
                The RESTORE statement is optional but should be
                included if you intend to use BACKDSNS for restoring.
                The DCB attributes of RESTORE are:
                RECFM=FB,LRECL=200,BLKSIZE=mult of 200                 |

The SYSUT2   DD statement defines the output tape.
                The  UNIT= MUST specify DEFER.
                The   VOL= MUST specify RETAIN.
                           If there are other files on the tape,
                           the REF= parameter can be specified.
                The LABEL= must be  specified to indicate the file
                           number.
                The  DISP= MUST be (NEW,KEEP).
                The   DSN= will be used for system information, such as
                           an EXPIRY DATE, or for CATALOGing the tape.

      NOTE..... DSN=NONE will no longer work if RACF does dsn checking.

      NOTE 2... DISP= MUST be (NEW,KEEP), because of the way the system
                handles cataloging functions. If you specify
                NEW,CATLG, the LAST file copied to the tape will be
                cataloged. If you  wish to catalog the FIRST file, you
                will have to add a 2nd step that references the first
                file with a disp of (OLD,CATLG).
                For example, use.......

                //CATALOG EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
                //MASTER DD DISP=(OLD,CATLG),UNIT=TAPE,
                //   VOL=REF=*.BACKDSNS.SYSUT2,
                //   DSN=*.BACKDSNS.SYSUT2


:h2. JCL COMMENTS, continued...
The SYSUT1   DD statement defines the input tape.
                This DD is only required in a RESTORE job.
                The UNIT= MUST specify DEFER.

The SYSIN    DD statement defines the IEBCOPY control statement file.
                The statement must be COPY  I=SYSUT1,O=SYSUT2

The DSNS     DD statement contains a list of the datasets to be backed
                up for a BACKUP job, or a list of datasets to be
                restored if this is a RESTORE job.
                The datasets can be PARTITIONED(PDS), SEQUENTIAL, VSAM,
                or DIRECT.
                DIRECT files are read as SEQUENTIAL files and are
                written to tape as a sequential file.
                If the data set is not catalogued, the volser can be
                specified starting in column 46.

       NOTE...  For a VSAM dataset, the volser of the CATALOG for the
                dataset MUST be specified for RACF access, and it must
                start in column 46.
                The dataset must reside on a disk volume.

:h1.Control Statements

The only control statement needed is the COPY statement for
PDSFAST/IEBCOPY.

                      VSAM file

If you HAVE to restore from an old backup, you will have to convert
the old record layout above to the new record layout.
You must also change the tape dataset name to BACKUP.the.disk.dsn,
and the disk dataset name to a new one, such as the.disk.dsn.NEW.
