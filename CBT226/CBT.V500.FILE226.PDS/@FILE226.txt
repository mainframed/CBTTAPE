//*      THE CMPRSEQ PROGRAM COMPARES TWO SEQUENTIAL CARD           *   FILE 226
//*      IMAGE FILES AND REPORTS PRECISELY THE DIFFERENCES          *   FILE 226
//*      BETWEEN THE TWO.  SUCH DIFFERENCES CAN CONSIST OF          *   FILE 226
//*      INSERTIONS, DELETIONS, AND REPLACEMENTS (OF EITHER         *   FILE 226
//*      EQUAL OR UNEQUAL SIZES).                                   *   FILE 226
//*                                                                 *   FILE 226
//*      CMPRSEQ ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY READING THE TWO INPUT         *   FILE 226
//*      FILES ALTERNATELY AND COMPARING THE CARD IMAGES AS IT      *   FILE 226
//*      GOES ALONG.  WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS TWO CARDS THAT             *   FILE 226
//*      MISMATCH, IT SAVES THEM AND CONTINUES TO READ THE TWO      *   FILE 226
//*      FILES ALTERNATELY.  EACH TIME IT READS A CARD FROM ONE     *   FILE 226
//*      FILE, IT COMPARES IT TO ALL CARDS THAT IT HAS READ         *   FILE 226
//*      FROM THE OTHER FILE SINCE THE START OF THE MISMATCH.       *   FILE 226
//*      IF NO MATCH IS FOUND, THEN IT SAVES THAT CARD AND          *   FILE 226
//*      PROCEEDS TO READ THE NEXT CARD FROM THE OTHER FILE.        *   FILE 226
//*      CMPRSEQ CONTINUES ALTERNATING BACK AND FORTH IN THIS       *   FILE 226
//*      MANNER UNTIL IT HAS READ A CARD THAT DOES MATCH ONE        *   FILE 226
//*      OF THE SAVED CARDS FROM THE OTHER FILE.  THE MISMATCH      *   FILE 226
//*      THEN CONSISTS OF ALL CARDS IN THE TWO SAVED STACKS         *   FILE 226
//*      THAT ARE BELOW THE TWO MATCHING CARDS.                     *   FILE 226

//*      THE MISMATCHED CARDS ARE DUMPED OUT TO LOGGING             *   FILE 226
//*      DATASETS, AND THEN CMPRSEQ PROCEEDS TO LOOK FOR THE        *   FILE 226
//*      NEXT MISMATCHED BLOCK.                                     *   FILE 226

//*      CMPRSEQ WILL COMPARE ONLY CARD IMAGE FILES - I.E.,         *   FILE 226
//*      FILES HAVING FIXED LENGTH RECORDS THAT ARE 80 BYTES        *   FILE 226

//*      CMPRSEQ WILL COMPARE ONLY ONE PAIR OF FILES PER            *   FILE 226
//*      INVOCATION.  IT WILL NOT COMPARE AN ENTIRE PDS             *   FILE 226
//*      LIBRARY, ALTHOUGH IT WILL COMPARE A JCL SELECTED PDS       *   FILE 226

//*      IF AN INSERTION BLOCK (FOR EXAMPLE) CONTAINS A CARD        *   FILE 226
//*      WHOSE DUPLICATE ALREADY APPEARS COMMONLY THROUGHOUT        *   FILE 226
//*      THE FILES BEING COMPARED (E.G., THE "SPACE 1"              *   FILE 226
//*      ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE STATEMENT, ETC.), THEN THE              *   FILE 226
//*      COMPARISON MAY BECOME, TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE,      *   FILE 226
//*      DESYNCHRONIZED DUE TO THE INSERTED CARD FINDING A          *   FILE 226
//*      MATCH WITH A PRE-EXISTING COPY OF THAT CARD IN THE         *   FILE 226
//*      OTHER FILE.  CMPRSEQ PROVIDES MECHANISMS TO HELP DEAL      *   FILE 226
//*      WITH SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEMS.  (NOTE, SYNCHRONIZATION     *   FILE 226
//*      PROBLEMS CAN OCCUR, NOT JUST WITH INSERTED BLOCKS,         *   FILE 226
//*      BUT ALSO WITH DELETED BLOCKS AND WITH REPLACED             *   FILE 226
