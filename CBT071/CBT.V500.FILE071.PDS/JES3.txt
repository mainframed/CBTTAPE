In order to keep all parts of a contribution together in one member,
many of the members in this PDS cannot be used directly from the PDS
but require further processing before use.

Check any members containing mods you are interested in. If the first
record contains a ./ in cols 1 and 2 you will need to run IEBUPDTE
using this member as input to convert the member into a PDS.

Look at the members in the PDS just created and see if they have a +/
in cols 1 and 2. If so you will have to change the +/ to ./ and execute
IEBUPDTE again to make another PDS from this member.

 CONTENTS:                CMD DSP


  THE CMD DSP CAME ABOUT WHEN THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITHIN THE COMPUTER
ROOM WITH A SET OF COMMANDS THAT THE OPERATORS WERE TO ENTER EVERY HOUR,
OR THERE ABOUTS, TO PERFORM CERTAIN TASKS AND THESE COMMANDS WOULD BE
FORGOTTEN. THEN IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE WERE COMMANDS THAT NEEDED TO BE
ENTERED EVERY MONDAY AND NO OTHER DAY. THESE WERE ALMOST ALWAYS
FORGOTTEN OR ENTERED AT A LATER TIME.
  THIS BROUGHT ABOUT CMD. CMD WILL CALL A MEMBER OF THE JES3 DISK READER
DATA SET TO EXECUTE COMMANDS THAT ARE IN THE MEMBER AT A REDEFINDED TIME
OF DAY AND DAY OF THE WEEK. THIS FREES THE OPERATOR FOR OTHER TASKS.
  FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION SEE CMDDOC MEMBER.

 ALL OF THE BELOW ARE IN SMP4 FORMAT.  ALL ARE INSTALLED AND WORKING
 IN A JES3/SP RELEASE 1.3.4 SYSTEM.  ALL EXCEPT FOR QJ00004 WILL ALSO
 WORK ON JES3/SP RELEASE 1.3.1.  THE 1.3.1 VERSION OF QJ00004 IS
 AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.

 CONTENTS:

 QJ00002  IATUX21  MODIFICATION TO SUPPRESS DATASET HEADER PAGES,
                   EVEN IF JOB HEADERS ARE BEING PRODUCED.

 QJ00004  IATUX20  J. WALTER THOMPSON JOB HEADER PAGE, FORMATTED
                   AS FOLLOWS:
                   1. JOB NAME IN BLOCK LETTERS
                   2. JOB TITLE IN BLOCK LETTERS (MAX. OF 8 CHARACTERS)
                   3. 18 LINES OF JES2-STYLE SEPARATOR LINES, EACH LINE
                      CONTAINING SYSOUT CLASS, JOB NUMBER, JOB NAME,
                      PROGRAMMER NAME, JOB TITLE, CPU ID, DAY OF WEEK,
                      DATE AND TIME PRINTED.
                   4. 10 LINES CONTAINING 'JWT' IN BLOCK LETTERS IN THE
                      CENTER, WITH BOXES ON EITHER SIDE.  THE LEFT BOX
                      DESCRIBES THE PRINTING LOCATION.  THE RIGHT BOX
                      CONTAINS DELIVERY INFORMATION.
                   JOB TITLE IS AN OPTIONAL FIELD TAKEN FROM THE SECOND
                   POSITIONAL PARAMETER IN THE JOB CARD ACCOUNTING
                   FIELD.  IF IT IS NOT PRESENT ON THE JOB CARD, IT IS
                   LEFT BLANK ON THE HEADER PAGE.  THE IDEA IS THAT JOB
                   NAMES OFTEN CANNOT BE MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THEY MUST
                   CONFORM TO RULES, SO PROVISION IS MADE FOR A TITLE
                   TO IDENTIFY THE LISTING.  DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS ARE
                   TABLE-DRIVEN, BASED ON A 4-CHARACTER DELIVERY CODE
                   WHICH IS THE THIRD POSITIONAL PARAMETER IN THE JOB
                   CARD ACCOUNTING FIELD.  IT, TOO, IS OPTIONAL.  IF
                   IT IS NOT PRESENT, THE BOX IS LEFT BLANK.  PRINT
                   LOCATION (LEFT BOX) IS TABLE-DRIVEN.

 QJ00005  IATUX23  MODIFICATION TO JOB TRAILER (BURST) PAGE TO
                   REPLACE SKIP TO CHANNEL 12 WITH SKIP 2 LINES.
                   (APPLIES ONLY TO IMPACT PRINTERS.)
                   ATTEMPTING TO SKIP TO CHANNEL 12 ON A 1403
                   PRINTER WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A CHANNEL 12 PUNCH
                   ON ANY OF ITS PAPER CARRIAGE CONTROL TAPES
                   IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

 QJ00006  IATUX06  ENFORCE JWT DASD ALLOCATION STANDARDS FOR AS TO
                   WHERE NEW DASD DATASETS ARE ALLOWED TO BE PLACED
                   (EXCLUDING DYNAMIC ALLOCATIONS).  USEFUL ONLY
                   AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN IATUX06 EXIT.

   JES2 TO JES3 JECL CONVERSION BRIDGE

           WRITTEN BY:  SKIP ABADIE (FDT)
                        FMC CORPORATION
                        P.O. BOX 470487
                        DALLAS, TEXAS

                        (214) 689-7655

                        INSTALLATION CODE:  FDT

   DISCLAIMER:  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR
          GUARANTEE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ETC. AD NAUSEUM.  NEITHER
          FMC NOR THE AUTHOR SHALL BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS
          THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OF THESE PROGRAMS.

   NOTES:
      1.  SAMPLE SMPE SYSMOD IN MEMBER JJECL00 MAY BE USED TO INSTALL
          MOST OF THE BRIDGE.  IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE
          PARTS OF THE BRIDGE THAT MUST BE ADDED TO IATUX28, IATUX29,
          IATUX33, IATUX34, IATUX44, AND IATUX03.

      2.  THE INPUT SERVICE EXITS (28, 29, 33, 34, 44) AND IATUX03 ARE
          INCLUDED IN THIER ENTIRETY.  ALL OF THE CODE IN IATUX03 IS
          NEEDED FOR THE BRIDGE, BUT THE OTHER EXITS CONTAIN SOME
          UNRELATED STUFF (E.G., CALLS TO ACF2).  YOU SHOULD REVIEW
          ALL OF THESE EXITS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THEM.

      3.  SAMPLE SMPE SYSMOD IN MEMBER JIWJM00 MAY BE USED TO INSTALL
          THE JESMSG MESSAGE WRITING PROGRAM, IATIWJM, AND IT'S
          ASSOCIATED MACROS.

      4.  CAUTION - I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE ALL COMMENTS IN THE SOURCE
          CODE MEANINGFUL.  WHEN IN DOUBT, LOOK AT THE CODE RATHER THAN
          THE COMMENTS.

      5.  WARNING - THE CODE SUPPLIED USES CERTAIN FIELDS IN THE INPUT
          SERVICE DATA CSECT THAT ARE RESERVED FOR THE USER.  THE FIELDS
          USED ARE ISFLAG8 AND ISDRSVU1.  IATUX03 USES A FIELD IN THE
          CI DSP DATA CSECT.  THE FIELD USED IS IDDRSUSR (8 WORDS).

      6.  CONVERSION OF REMOTE NAMES AND NODE NAMES MUST BE CAREFULLY
          REVIEWED BY ANYONE INSTALLING THE BRIDGE.  THE ROUTINES FOR
          CONVERTING DESTINATION NAMES IN IATJ33X AND IATUX03 ARE
          SPECIFIC TO FMC.  AT THE LEAST, THE NODENAME TABLES WILL
          NEED TO BE CHANGED TO REFLECT THE NAMES OF YOUR NODES.

      7.  GENERAL FUNCTION OF EACH MEMBER IS AS FOLLOWS:

          ** MACROS **

          FMCJCB   - DSECT OF JECL CONVERSION BRIDGE WORK AREA
          FMCOJP   - DSECT OF OUTPUT JCL PARAMETER BLOCK
          FMCSJAR  - DSECT OF SMF JECL BRIDGE ACTIVITY RECORD
          FMCXIS   - DSECT OF INPUT SERVICE EXIT COMMON CONTROL BLOCK
          ISWJMWT  - CALL JESMSG MESSAGE FORMAT/WRITE ROUTINE (IATIWJM)
          ISWJVAR  - CONSTRUCT SEGMENT LIST FOR IATIWJM

          ** MODULES **

          IATIWJM  - FORMAT AND WRITE MESSAGES TO JESMSG DATASET
          IATJECL  - BRIDGE ROUTING MODULE.  CALLED BY EXITS 33, 34,
                     44, AND 29.  THIS MODULE CALLS THE APPROPRIATE
                     CONVERSION MODULE (IATJ33X, IATJ34X, IATJ44X) AND
                     WRITES THE SMF RECORD WHEN CALLED BY IATUX29.  THE
                     SMF RECORD IS ONLY WRITTEN FOR JOBS THAT REQUIRED
                     SOME BRIDGE ACTIVITY.
          IATJ33X  - THE HEART OF THE CONVERSION BRIDGE.  J33X DOES
                     ALL OF THE JECL STATEMENT CONVERSIONS.  SOME
                     CONVERTED CARDS ARE INSERTED IMMEDIATELY, WHILE
                     OTHERS, SUCH AS //*MAIN AND OUTPUT JCL STATEMENTS,
                     ARE NOT INSERTED UNTIL THE FIRST EXEC OR INSTREAM
                     PROC IS FOUND.
          IATJ34X  - SCANS DD STATEMENTS FOR SYSOUT OPERAND.  WHEN A
                     SYSOUT DD IS FOUND THAT CONTAINS 3 SUBPARMS, THE
                     THIRD IS CHECKED FOR A POSSIBLE MATCH WITH A JES2
                     /*OUTPUT CODENAME.  WHEN A MATCH OCCURS, IATJ34X
                     CHANGES THE SYSOUT OPERAND TO A SIMPLE CLASS
                     REFERENCE (E.G., SYSOUT=(A,,ABC) ==> SYSOUT=A), AND
                     INSERTS A CARD WITH AN OUTPUT JCL REFERENCE,
                     E.G.,  //  OUTPUT=(*.ABC).  NOTE THAT PROCS ARE
                     NOT EXPANDED AT INPUT SERVICE TIME, SO ANY SYSOUT
                     REFERENCE TO A JES2 /*OUTPUT CARD IN A PROC WILL
                     NOT BE CONVERTED TO AN OUTPUT JCL REFERENCE UNTIL
                     THE INTERNAL TEXT IS BUILT AND PASSED TO IATUX03.
          IATJ44X  - LOOKS FOR AN INSTREAM PROC WITHIN THE JOB.  IF AN
                     INSTREAM PROC IS FOUND, IT SETS A FLAG THAT TELLS
                     IATJ33X TO START INSERTING STATEMENTS.
          IATUX28  - INITIALIZES THE INPUT SERVICE EXIT COMMON CONTROL
                     BLOCK (XIS).  THIS IS THE FIRST INPUT SERVICE EXIT
                     CALLED.
          IATUX29  - FREES THE INPUT SERVICE EXIT COMMON CONTROL BLOCK
                     (XIS).  CALLS IATJECL TO CLEANUP AND WRITE SMF
                     RECORD.  THIS IS THE LAST INPUT SERVICE EXIT.
          IATUX33  - JECL STATEMENT SCAN.  CALLS IATJECL FOR EACH JECL
                     STATEMENT RECEIVED.
          IATUX34  - DD STATEMENT SCAN.  CALLS IATJECL FOR EACH DD
                     STATEMENT RECEIVED.
          IATUX44  - SJF AND OTHER JCL STATEMENT SCAN.  CALLS IATJECL
                     FOR EACH STATEMENT RECEIVED.
          IATUX03  - INTERNAL TEXT EXIT FROM CI.  THIS EXIT CONVERTS
                     SYSOUT DD STATEMENTS THAT REFERENCE A JES2
                     /*OUTPUT CARD TO AN OUTPUT JCL REFERENCE.  EXIT 3
                     WILL CONVERT ANY /*OUTPUT CARD REFERENCE THAT WAS
                     NOT CONVERTED IN IATJ34X.

      8.  GOOD LUCK.

  JES3 SPOOL DISPLAY FACILITY ISPF DIALOG (SUPPORTS JES3 1.3.4)

  For JES3 SP2.2.1 and above use the SDF in member FILE021.

  ORIGINALLY WRITTEN BY JOHN JOHNSON OF NCS AND EXTENSIVLY
  MODIFIED BY BRUCE ENGLE OF BANK OF AMERICA.

  THIS FILE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING IEBUPDTE FORMAT MEMBERS:

  CNTL      THIS PDS CONTAINS THE ASSEMBLY/LINK JCL
  SOURCE    THIS PDS CONTAINS THE SOURCE
  MSGS      THIS PDS CONTAINS THE ISPF MESSAGES
  PANELS    THIS PDS CONTAINS THE ISPF PANELS
  CLISTS    THIS PDS CONTAINS THE CLISTS

  THE CNTL PDS CONTAINS MEMBERS TO INSTALL THE JES3 1.3.4 VERSION OF
  THE JES3/ISPF FULL SCREEN TSO SPOOL DISPLAY PROGRAMS.

  MOST OF THE PROGRAMS REQUIRE SYS1.JES3MAC AT ASSEMBLY TIME.
  SDFDSP REQUIRES SYS1.AJES3SRC AS WELL.

  IF YOU HAVE MODIFIED IATYDSP YOU SHOULD PUT SYS1.SMPSTS IN FRONT
  OF SYS1.AJES3SRC, AND IF YOU HAVE MODIFIED JES3 MACROS YOU SHOULD
  PUT SYS1.SMPMTS IN FRONT OF SYS1.JES3MAC.

  SDF IS NOW A COMMAND PROCESSOR AND MAY BE CALLED BY ISSUING THE
  TSO COMMAND SDF WHILE UNDER ISPF.

  THE PROGRAMS MUST BE LINKED INTO THREE LOAD MODULES: SDF
                                                       SDFINIT
                                                       SDFSSI

  BOTH SDFINIT AND SDFSSI MUST BE APF AUTHORIZED.
  SDFINIT MUST BE LISTED IN THE AUTHORIZED COMMAND TABLE IKJEFTE2.
  SDFSSI MUST BE LISTED IN THE AUTHORIZED PROGRAM TABLE IKJEFTE8.

  SDFINIT ALLOCATES THE JES3 SPOOL DATA SETS TO DDNAME SDFSPOOL
  AND THEY REMAIN ALLOCATED AFTER COMMAND TERMINATION. SDFINIT
  IS NOT CALLED IF SDFSPOOL HAS ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED. SDFINIT
  DETERMINES THE THE DATA SETS TO ALLOCATE BY SCHEDULING AN SRB
  TO THE JES3 ADDRESS SPACE TO SEE WHAT IS ALLOCATED AND BY EXAMINING
  THE JES3 CHECKPOINT DATA SET.

  YOU MAY PREALLOCATE THE JES3 DATA SETS YOURSELF BEFORE CALLING SDF.
  THE DATA SETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO DDNAME SDFSPOOL, WITH THE JCT
  DATA SET CONCATENATED FIRST, FOLLOWED BY EACH OF THE SPOOL DATA SETS.
  SDFINIT IS NOT CALLED IF SDFSPOOL IS ALREADY ALLOCATED.

  REFER TO THE MAIN PROGRAM SOURCE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

   Time Sharing Subsystem Option (TSSO) is a  package designed to
   increase operator productivity by automating tasks which need not be
   performed manually. TSSO performs its function through two integrated
   components. The Operator  Productivity  Facility (OPF) extends the
   power of TSO to the MVS opera- tor's  console,  and  the Automated
   Operations  Facility  (AOF) enhances an installation's ability to
   control system events based on  console message traffic.  TSSO also
   enhances end-user productivity by allowing end-user access to the MVS
   command  subsystem.  This  document  describes the installation of
   TSSO, TSSO parameters, and the use of the two components.

   A guide to the new features of TSSO Version 4, Release 3 is in member
   RELGDE42 in this dataset.

   Anyone with an interest in automated operations is invited to look
   at TSSO as a software tool providing many of the primitives required
   for common automated operations tasks.  These primitives include
   highlighting, lowlighting, replying and reacting to operating system
   messages, in addition to the ability to issue a command and retrieve
   the response in CLIST variables.

   Questions about TSSO may be referred to Marc Schare at

   ARE ALL IN SMPE FORMAT.  HERE IS A LIST OF THE MODS AND THEIR
   VARIOUS COMPONENTS:

   1.  FLASH JOBNAME ON 3480 DISPLAYS FOR TAPE MOUNTS.
       THIS MOD UPDATES IATLVVR, AND IS CONTAINED IN MEMBER
       CH10216 AND CH10217.

   2.  ENHANCEMENT TO THE INQUIRE BACKLOG (I B) COMMAND TO SHOW
       BACKLOG BY JOB CLASS.  THIS MOD UPDATES IATIQBK, AND IS
       CONTAINED IN MEMBER CH10093.

   3.  SUPRESS PRINT OF JESMSG, SYSMSG, AND JESJCL FOR TSO & STC
       JOBS UNLESS THERE IS A JCL ERROR.  THIS MOD UPDATES IATUX19
       AND IS CONTAINED IN MEMBER CH10110.

   4.  FORCE PROPER PROCLIB BASED ON JOB DESCRIPTOR CLASS.  THIS
       MOD HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS PLACING A //*MAIN PROCID=XX
       CARD IN THE JOB'S JCL.  WHILE THIS CODE IS CHUBB SPECIFIC
       (IN THAT IT USES CHUBB JDC'S AND PROCLIBS), IT WILL SHOW
       YOU HOW IT CAN BE DONE.  ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS MOD IS CODE
       THAT CAUSES JES3 TO IGNORE ANY VALUE EXCEPT 0 THAT IS CODED
       IN THE PRTY PARAMETER OF THE JOB CARD (WHICH FORCES USE OF THE
       DEFAULTS IN THE JES3 INISH DECK).  THIS MOD UPDATES IATISJB AND
       IS CONTAINED IN MEMBER CH10140.

   5.  SYSOUT DATASET DIRECTORY FOR BATCH JOBS.  THIS GROUP OF MODS
       PUTS A DIRECTORY OF THE SYSOUT DATASETS CREATED BY A JOB INTO THE
       JOB'S JESMGS DATASET.  THE DIRECTORY SHOWS A DATASET'S DDNAME,
       DESTINATION, FORMS, CARRAIGE, LINES, COPIES, AND SYSOUT CLASS.
       IN ALSO SHOWS A "LOCATION" FIELD FOR EACH DATASET., WHICH IS
       PART OF ANOTHER CHUBB MODIFICATION.  AS A RESULT, YOU WILL HAVE
       TO REMOVE THE CODE FOR "LOCATION" TO USE THIS IN YOUR
       INSTALLATION.  HERE IS A LIST OF THE MEMBERS AND THE MODULES
       THAT THEY HIT:
            MEMBER       MODULE/MACRO
            -------      ------------

            CH10133      CREATES LOAD MODULE
            CH10134      MODIFIES MACRO IATYRSQ

   6.  ENHANCEMENT TO THE INQUIRE ACTIVE (I A) COMMAND.
       THIS MOD ALLOWS YOU TO QUALIFY YOUR INQUIRE BY JOB CLASS
       OR JOB GROUP.  IT ALSO SHOWS THE JOB CLASS FOR EACH JOB
       IN THE RESPONSE.  THIS MOD IS CONTAINED IN MEMBERS CH10121
       AND CH10092, AND UPDATES MODULE IATIQAC.

 CONTENTS:

   Usermod to IATUX26 to assign a job cpu time limit for test job classe
   (R,S,U and B).  The time limit assigned is based on the job class and
   the cpu model the job is executing on.  This way the job gets an
   equivalent amount of cpu time no matter where it runs.

 CONTENTS:
 These files contains the Rockwell Source Maintenance ISPF Dialog.  It
 has been extracted from a more extensive ISPF environment for systems
 programmers to allow distibution.  Every effort has been made to remove
 local dependencies, although some still exist (e.g. the SHOW program
 called by several modules which references user information in ACF2
 records).

 Use this dialog at your own risk.  The author will attempt to provide
 assistance (time permitting) for problems encountered.

    File     Description

    CLIST    Clist and Rexx procedure library
    LOAD     Load library (be careful with this)
    MACLIB   All user macros
    PANELS   ISPF panels
    SKELS    ISPF skeletons
    SOURCE   Source for load
    TEXT     DCF/BookMaster Script text
             (has not been updated in several years and just recently
              converted from a 1977 version of Waterloo Script into
              DCF and BookMaster tags - some formatting still remains).

 The above files were generated by using the TSO Transmit command to
 send the respective partitioned data sets to a sequential file. To use
 these files issue the TSO RECEIVE command:

       RECEIVE INDA(xxxxx.xxx(member))

 Anyone is welcome to clean this dialog up to make it a fully
 self-contained distribution.

 CONTENTS:
    This modification to JES3 is intended to direct batch jobs to
    a system that is licensed for all of the programs that are
    found on EXEC statements in a job's JCL.  It is designed around
    the Chubb production environment (a four processor complex, with
    the systems named A1, A2, A3, and A4), but can be adapted to
    other installations if anyone is so inclined.

 CONTENTS:
    This member contains SDF code for an MVS 5.x/JES3 5.2 system up
    to an OS/390 2.6 system.

    In order to correctly assemble this code, the PTF for APAR OW30849
    must be applied.

    SDF will work before, and will work after the IATUJCT utility has
    been run.

    NOTE: Look at FILE045 and FILE046, you might find them useful
          during the install of SDF.

    updates provided by Steve O'Neal from Phillips Petroleum Company.

    Here are Steve's notes on the changes:

    All the changes have the eyecatcher "PPCO" in them.

    SDFBROWS - fix for quoted fields used in searches.
    SDFCOPY  - fix for IEF375I/IEF376I messages not displayed
               when using the "L" option for a job under option "J".
               This started after MVS ESA 5.1.
    SDFDRVR  - Support for the DSP under SDF.
    SDFTASK  - Support for the DSP under SDF.
    SDFTIME  - Y2K fix.
