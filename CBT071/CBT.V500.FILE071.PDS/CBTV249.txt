//*      THE PRIMARY CHANGE IN THIS RELEASE IS SUPPORT FOR AP AND   *
//*      MP CONFIGURATIONS. THERE ARE TWO KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH THIS  *
//*      RELEASE WHICH SHOULD BE NOTED IF YOU HAVE IT OR INTEND TO  *
//*      INSTALL IT.                                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*      1. THE CPU COMMAND GENERATES A ZERODIVIDE IN A MP ENVIRON- *
//*      MENT. SUGGESTED CIRCUMVENTION IS TO USE THE UP VERSION     *
//*      OF THE CPU COMMAND WHICH WAS DISTRIBUTED WITH THE REST OF  *
//*      OMF IN SOURCE IN MEMBER CPUUP AND IN OBJECT IN CPUUPO. THE *
//*      PROBLEM WILL BE CORRECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.             *
//*                                                                 *
//*      2.THERE IS A BUG IN IBM CODE FOR RPSIGNL SUPPORT WHICH WILL*
//*      CAUSE THE CPU TO GO INTO A LOOP DURING VARY CPU(X), ONLINE *
//*      PROCESSING IF ANOTHER CPU REQUESTS TIMER SERVICES FROM THE *
//*      CPU COMING ONLINE. THIS WOULD AFFECT IBM CODE ONLY UNDER   *
//*      VERY VERY UNLIKELY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT IF YOU INSTALL THE   *
//*      SUPPLIED OMF CHANGE TO TIMER MANAGEMENT TO STABILIZE       *
//*      SAMPLING ON BOTH CPU'S, THIS BUG WILL GET YOU EVERY TIME.  *
//*      THE SUGGESTION IS THAT YOU PURGE STATDIE PRIOR TO          *
//*      ISSUING THE VARY COMMAND, THEN RESTART IT AFTER THE        *
//*      CPU IS ONLINE. THE SUGGESTED SEQUENCE IS:                  *
//*                                                                 *

//*                       (ONCE THE CPU IS ONLINE)                  *

//*      THE LATTER PROBLEM IS VERY NASTY, AND IF YOU HAVE ANY      *
//*      DIFFICULTY IN IMPLEMENTING THIS CHANGE OPERATIONALLY       *
//*      THEN I SUGGEST THAT YOU DO NOT INSTALL THE TIME            *
//*      MANAGEMENT ZAP. THERE IS NO FEASIBLE CORRECTION TO THE     *
//*      PROBLEM FROM WITHIN OMF AT THIS TIME, AND A FIX FROM IBM   *
//*      IN ANY REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME SEEMS UNLIKELY            *
//*                                                                 *

//*      THE CMPRSEQ PROGRAM COMPARES TWO SEQUENTIAL CARD           *
//*      IMAGE FILES AND REPORTS PRECISELY THE DIFFERENCES          *
//*      BETWEEN THE TWO. SUCH DIFFERENCES CAN CONSIST OF           *
//*      INSERTIONS, DELETIONS, AND REPLACEMENTS (OF EITHER         *

//*      CMPRSEQ ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY READING THE TWO INPUT         *
//*      FILES ALTERNATELY AND COMPARING THE CARD IMAGES AS IT      *
//*      GOES ALONG. WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS TWO CARDS THAT              *
//*      MISMATCH, IT SAVES THEM AND CONTINUES TO READ THE TWO      *
//*      FILES ALTERNATELY. EACH TIME IT READS A CARD FROM ONE      *
//*      FILE, IT COMPARES IT TO ALL CARDS THAT IT HAS READ         *
//*      FROM THE OTHER FILE SINCE THE START OF THE MISMATCH.       *
//*      IF NO MATCH IS FOUND, THEN IT SAVES THAT CARD AND          *
//*      PROCEEDS TO READ THE NEXT CARD FROM THE OTHER FILE.        *

//*      MANNER UNTIL IT HAS READ A CARD THAT DOES MATCH ONE        *
//*      OF THE SAVED CARDS FROM THE OTHER FILE. THE MISMATCH       *
//*      THEN CONSISTS OF ALL CARDS IN THE TWO SAVED STACKS         *

//*           (5) AND EDITING OF DOCUMENTATION IN GENERAL TO        *
//*           IMPROVE READABILITY OF SOURCE LISTINGS.               *
//*           INCORPORATION OF DYNAMIC ALLOCATION ELIMINATES        *
//*           THE NEED FOR THE DD STATEMENTS FOR USER CATA-         *
//*           LOGS REQUIRED BY THE 07/16/76 VERSION OF THE          *

//*                                                                 *

//*          HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE, BUT WOULD NOT HAVE    *
//*          BEEN NOTICED BY THE PSR UNLESS HE WAS SPECIFICALLY     *

//*      YOU MAY EXPERIENCE NCP SLOWDOWNS. THIS IS BE- CAUSE        *
//*      AS IMS CONNECTS TO THESE TERMINALS THE MOD WILL FORCE      *
//*      THE 24X80 'SIGN' SCREEN TO BE SENT TO EVERY 3270 ON        *
//*      YOUR IMS NETWORK.  TO GET AROUND THIS PROBLEM, DON'T       *
//*      OPEN ALL THE NODES. IN OUR CASE, WE STILL HAD TO OPEN      *
//*      THE PRINTER NODES SO WE SET UP AN NCCF CLIST THAT          *

//*              CHANGES: THERE WAS SOME RATHER COMPLEX             *

//*              IT WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH THE               *
//*              TRAKCALC MACRO. THIS SHOULD CONTINUE TO            *

//*              THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE INVOLVED THE           *
//*              BUILDING OF CCW'S. THIS PROGRAM USED TO            *

//*              LENGTH AND DATA LENGTH BUT NO DATA.  THE           *
//*              SLI BIT WAS TURNED ON CAUSING IBM TO PAD           *
//*              THE REST WITH BINARY ZEROS WHICH WAS               *
//*              EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED.  WITH THE 3081             *
//*              IBM NOW RECOMMENDS SENDING A MINIMUM OF            *
//*              16 BYTES OF DATA. (REF: 3081 CHANNEL               *
//*              CHARACTERISTICS MANUAL) TO SATISFY THIS            *
//*              REQUIREMENT WE TACKED EIGTH BYTES OF               *
//*              BINARY ZERO ON THE END OF EACH CCW. THAT           *
//*              MADE IBM HAPPY SO WE'RE HAPPY TOO.                 *

//*              THE LAST CHANGE WAS TO COUNT THE NUMBER            *
//*              OF CONSECUTIVE IDENTICAL IO ERRORS AND TO          *
//*              ABEND WITH A U555 WHEN THE COUNT EXCEEDS           *

//*            THE COMMAND CHECKS FOR TSO OPERATOR AUTHORITY        *
//*            FOR ACCESS.  ALSO, PCF COMMAND LEVEL IS              *
//*            EXAMINED.  PCF LEVEL(0,0) USERS MAY ISSUE ALL        *
//*            O/S AND JES2 COMMANDS WHILE OTHERS MAY ONLY          *
//*            ISSUE O/S AND JES2 DISPLAY COMMANDS ONLY .           *
//*            FOR FURTHER PROTECTION, A TABLE OF AUTHORIZED        *
//*            USERS IS ALSO USED TO DETERMINE THE USERS            *
//*            AUTHORITY TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND.  IF ALL OF         *
//*            THESE CHECKS ARE MET, THE USER WILL THEN BE          *
//*            PROMPTED FOR AN AUTHORIZATION PASSWORD.  WHILE       *
//*            EXCESSIVE, THESE KINDS OF CHECKS WERE REQUIRED       *
//*            HERE TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY.  SINCE THE CONSOLE        *
//*            BUFFERS ARE IN THEIR OWN ADDRESS SPACE UNDER         *
//*            SP 1.3 AND THE COMMAND INTERFACE IS SVC 34,          *
//*            THIS COMMAND MUST BE AUTHORIZED.  THIS               *
//*            AUTHORIZATION IS CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY AN SVC        *
//*            CALL TO AN SVC WHICH SETS THE COMMAND IN             *
//*            PROTECT KEY 0 TO SET THE AUTHORIZED BIT ON.          *
//*            THUS THE COMMAND CAN PERFORM ALL REQUIRED            *
//*            FUCTIONS LATER AS REQUIRED.  THE SVC METHOD OF       *
//*            AUTHORIZATION IS USED INSTEAD OF IKJEFTE2            *
//*            AUTHORIZATION SO THAT THIS COMMAND CAN RUN           *
//*            UNDER SPF OPTION 6.                                  *
