./ ADD NAME=TRYAPL2
TryAPL2 - Copyright 1991  IBM CORP, All rights reserved.

To install TryAPL2 to a hard disk:
  - create a directory on the hard disk. For example:
            md tryapl2
  - make your new directory the current directory. For example:
            cd tryapl2
  - insert the TryAPL2 disk in drive A and execute the following:
            copy a:contract
            copy a:read.me
            a:tryapl2a
            a:tryapl2b
            a:tryapl2c
  - if you want to restore the LaserJet formatted documentation
    (on disk 2 of the 5.25" set), insert the TryAPL2 disk
    in drive A and execute the following:
            a:tryapl2d

To install TryAPL2 on a floppy disk:

  - make the floppy drive the current drive. For example:
            b:
  - insert the TryAPL2 disk in drive A and execute the following:
            a:tryapl2a
            a:tryapl2b
            a:tryapl2c

  NOTE: If you install to 360K disks, you must change disks between
        the above steps.

  NOTE: The files from tryapl2d are documentation for printing
        on HP LaserJet printers, are very large, and are not required
        required for execution.

To run TryAPL2 from a hard disk:

  - Make active the directory containing TryAPL2 and enter the following:
             tryapl2

To run Tryapl2 from a floppy disk,

  - insert the first or only TryAPL2 disk that you created into drive A
    and execute the following:
             tryapl2

  NOTE: You can run from a single 360K disk using the files on
        tryapl2a. You will need to change the disk to tryapl2b
        after TryAPL2 is running to access workspaces other
        than TRYDOC. To run TRYDOC, )LOAD with disk 1 inserted
        then switch to disk 3 before selecting a topic for viewing.
