//***FILE 645 is from Michael Knorr and contains updates to the     *   FILE 645
//*           SHOWMVS program from File 492, to add a line at the   *   FILE 645
//*           top of the display, which shows if SHOWMVS is         *   FILE 645
//*           currently running as an authorized program, or not.   *   FILE 645
