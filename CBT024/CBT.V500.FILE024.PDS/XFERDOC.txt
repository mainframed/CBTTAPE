The XFERDUMP procedure will transfer the MVS/XA SVC dumps from
disk to tape and create an index entry in the dump index
dataset, "OP.P.XFERDUMP.INDEX".

The name of the dataset on tape will be "OP.P.XFERDUMP.TAPExx"
where "xx" is either 00, 01, 02, 03, etc., corresponding to the
associated "SYS1.DUMPxx" dataset name.

To find the volume containing the current tape, use the "%XIX" clist to
browse the dump index dataset.  The file number of each dump on tape is
one higher than the number of the dump dataset. For example,
"SYS1.DUMP00" on tape 009999 would be named "OP.P.XFERDUMP.TAPE00" and
reside on file 1.

It is important that the cataloged procedure "XFERDUMP" be used to
transfer dump datasets to tape because the internally called CLISTS
will update the dump index dataset ("OP.P.XFERDUMP.INDEX"). The listing
from the run of this procedure will, in its job message log, also have
the dump titles and volume serial number of the tape in an easily
readable format. The MASTER TRACE table will be printed along with
a SUMMARY dump.

To transfer full dump datasets to tape (I would wait for a least
THREE datasets to fill), enter the following SOF command at the
system console:

    > /XFERDUMP

If, for some reason, SOF is not available, the dumps can be transfered
by entering:

    > S JOBRDR,N=XFERDUMP
