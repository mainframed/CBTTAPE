1.1  INTRODUCTION
_________________

TSTVS  is  developed for editing PDS member if TSO/VTAM is not available.  It
is a product of Skybird Systems.   TSTVS communicates  with  the  MVS  master
console operator.


1.1.1  INPUT AND OUTPUT

INP01 and OUTP01. Both ddnames are dynamically allocated.


1.2  STARTUP OF TSTVS
_____________________

At startup, TSTVS asks for an authorized userid + a password (msg EDT301A and
EDT302A).  With  this  userid  and  password,  TSTVS  will perform a RACROUTE
REQUEST=VERIFY with terminalname=LUTSTVS.

After verification of the user+password+terminal, the resource $TSTVS in  the
FACILITY class will be checked. In A RACF-system the user should be connected
to  this  profile. In an ACF2 system, a generalized resource should have been
created. The resource type have to be defined in the GSO CLASMAP record (e.g.
SAFMAPS(FAC/FACILITY)).

If no RACF or ACF2 is active (or stopped), TSTVS  will  bypass  the  security
check  and  will  ask  for  the program password (msg EDT310A).  Refer to the
responsible systems programmer for the correct password.

1.3  ALLOCATING DATASETS
________________________

If  you start TSTVS the msg EDT200A Enter command or 'HELP' appears after the
security check.

If you reply EDT200A with 'ALLOC' the monitor  prompts  with  'EDT100A  Enter
dataset  name  or 'CANCEL'', which should be replied with a dsname of max. 44
bytes or the word 'CANCEL' If the reply is 'CANCEL', the ALLOC function  will
be  terminated.    msg  EDT198I en EDT200A will appear.  After this reply the
question 'EDT101A Enter volume serial or 'U' appears, which should be replied
with a max 6 positions long volume number  or  'U'.  If  you  reply  'U'  the
catalog is searched.

If  these  two replies are ok, the msg 'EDT103I Allocation of dataset is suc-
cessful'  will appear, otherwise a suitable error message will  be  produced.
(see messages)

If  you have finished with this library you can allocate another library with
ALLOC. (The previous library is automaticly freed).   Other possible  replies
on msg EDT200A are.

COMMAND           FUNCTION

RENAME            Rename of a data set

A MEMBERNAME      Create a member

AN MEMBERNAME     Create a member including line numbers

U MEMBERNAME      Update of a member

UN MEMBERNAME     Update of a member including line numbers

D MEMBERNAME      DELETE a member from the library

R MEMBER,NEWNAME  RENAME a member in the library into 'newname'

PDSLIST           Listpds of the entire library

PDSLIST,'KEY'     Listpds  of  the  library  starting with member, whose name
                  starts with 'key'

EOJ               Terminate the console monitor

HELP              Gives help information about the commands. Message  EDT205I
                  will be given


1.4  RENAMING DATASETS
______________________







                                  Manual Console Monitor TSTVS version 3.0  3









1.4.1  RENAME A CATALOGUED DATASET

The  reply  on  msg  EDT200A  ENTER  COMMAND OR 'HELP' should be replied with
'RENAME'. After this, reply EDT100A ENTER DATASET NAME  OR  'CANCEL'  with  a
name  of  a  catalogued  dataset and reply EDT101A ENTER VOLUME SERIAL OR 'U'
with an 'U'

Now reply the next msg EDT106A ENTER NEW DATASET  NAME  OR  'CANCEL'  with  a
newname. This name should not exist in any catalog.

After  RENAME,  the message EDT199I RENAME OF DATASET SUCCESSUL or a suitable
error message should appear.


1.4.2  RENAME A NOT CATALOGUED DATASET

The only difference between RENAME of a not catalogued dataset  and  a  cata-
logued dataset (see previous chapter) is the reply on msg EDT101A.

This  message should be replied with a valid and online volume serial number.
After reply of msg EDT106A, the dataset will be renamed on that volume.

+--- NOTE! -----------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                           |
| If msg EDT101A has been replied with  a  volume  serial  number  and  the |
| dataset is catalogued, the catalog entry is NOT renamed.                  |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+


1.5  LIST THE DIRECTORY OF A PDS
________________________________

A  listing  of  the  directory of the allocated PDS will be displayed, if the
reply on  msg  EDT200A  is  'PDSLIST'  or  'PDSLIST,key',  If  the  reply  is
'PDSLIST',  a  list  of  the directory is displayed upon the console.  If the
reply is 'PDSLIST,key', a list of directory-entries  is  displayed,  starting
with the membername beginning with 'key'.  When 'key' is not present the list
begins with next higher key.

+--- NOTE ------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                           |
| If you enters 'PDSLIST' or 'PDSLIST,key' and there are more than 16 lines |
| the  msg  'EDT017A  SHOULD  TSTVS  CONTINUE THIS FUNCTION ? REPLY Y OR N' |
| appears. If you reply with 'Y' the function continues. With reply 'N' the |
| function is terminated with msg EDT018I (see messages).                   |
|                                                                           |

1.6  CREATE A MEMBER
____________________

Message  'EDT200A Enter command or 'HELP' must be replied with 'A membername'
or 'AN membername' If the specified name is already present in  the  library,
the data can be overwritten.

Now appears message 'EDT003A Enter data, 'SAVE' or 'SUBMIT'' The 'data' needs
no  comment  R xx,SAVE is to save the data in the member The messages EDT026A
and EDT200A will be given.  R xx,SUBMIT is save the data and submit  the  job
to  the  JES2  internal  reader.   After the action EDT200A appears.   If msg
EDT003A has been replied with 'SAVE' or 'SUBMIT', the user will  be  prompted
with the message:  'EDT026A enter new name to save your workarea or reply 'U'
to  save  your workarea in member xxxxxxxx' If you reply with a 'newname' the
member is saved under that name. With reply 'U' the member is saved under the

1.7.19  REMARKS

1.  The linenumbers in the operands of the subcommands are generated  by  the
    program  TSTVS  and  are  max  four positions long (Leading zeroes may be
    omitted).  These numbers are not physically in the data and  are  visible
    if  you  enter a 'LIST', 'XLST' or 'PRINT' subcommand.  The connection of
    linenumber and line change, when you enter a 'I', 'R' or 'D'  subcommand.
    (The first line is always 1 and the increment is always 1).

2.  The maximum of lines is 3999.

    During  updating  of  a  member with more than 3999 lines, the first 3999
    lines are read and saved. (be careful).
