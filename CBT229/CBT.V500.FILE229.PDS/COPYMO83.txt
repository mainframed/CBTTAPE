**      (See the documentation in the code, below.)         **           00011
**                                                          **           00012
**  ** ================================================ **  **           00013
**  **  Defaults have purposely been left, so the       **  **           00014
**  **  output will resemble that of the original       **  **           00015
**  **  program version.  And all of your original JCL  **  **           00016
**  **  will still work.  However the list of "options  **  **           00017
**  **  in effect" will be printed in //SYSPRINT by     **  **           00018
**  **  default.  It will give you an idea about what   **  **           00019
**  **  kind of things are really possible to do,       **  **           00020
**  **  using this program.  IBM SL, and ASCII SL,      **  **           00021
**  **  are extensively supported.  So are 64K blocks.  **  **           00022
**  ** ================================================ **  **           00023
**  **  Options in COPYMODS may be coded in the PARM    **  **           00024
**  **  of the EXEC card or, more conveniently, in      **  **           00025
**  **  a separate //SYSIN DD card, which is automati-  **  **           00026
**  **  cally recognized if it is present in the JCL.   **  **           00027
**  ** ================================================ **  **           00028
**  **  Assembly time defaults can be changed by        **  **           00029
**  **  altering the (extremely flexible) PARMTABL.     **  **           00030
**  ** ================================================ **  **           00031
**                                                          **           00032
**  PURPOSE: COPY ALL FILES OF AN INPUT TAPE TO ONE TO 16   **           00033
**     OUTPUT TAPES.  THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM  **           00034
**     WAS FOR COPYING THE SHARE MVS MODS TAPE.             **           00035
**                                                          **           00036
**     This has been revised, with the many new functions   **           00037
**     that have been added to COPYMODS.  Besides copying   **           00038
**     tapes, COPYMODS can read and measure tapes, as well  **           00039
**     as altering the copied tapes in many ways, such as   **           00040
**     stripping the labels or leading tape marks off.      **           00041
**     The VOLSER and OWNER can be altered in the copied    **           00042
**     tapes, and all labels can also be altered, through   **           00043
**     a process of dumping the labels to a FB-80 file      **           00044
**     (LABLDUMP option), editing the labels, stripping     **           00045
**     the labels in a copy operation (STRIP option), and   **           00046
**     splicing all the labels back in another copy         **           00047
**     operation (LABADDIN option).  COPYMODS can also      **           00048
**     INIT tapes, as many as 16 at a time.  No input tape  **           00049
**     is needed for an INIT operation (INITVOLS option).   **           00050
**                                                          **           00051
**     To see all the COPYMODS options, look at label       **           00052
**     PARMTABL in the PARMCHEK CSECT.  To see the keyword  **           00053
**     parms for SYSIN, see the code a few lines after the  **           00054
**     label CARDREAD in the PARMCHEK CSECT.                **           00055
**                                                          **           00056
**     The different COPYMODS parms or options can be used  **           00057
**     in combination with each other, as long as they      **           00058
**     don't contradict each other.  In certain cases, the  **           00059
**     use of one option will cause the automatic turn-off  **           00060
**     of one or more other options that contradict with    **           00061
**     it.  This "adjustment" is done by the COPYMODS       **           00062
**     program just after it receives the options settings  **           00063
**     back from the PARMCHEK program.  For example, if     **           00064
**     both LABLDUMP and LABADDIN (which contradict each    **           00065
**     other) are set, COPYMODS will make a judgment that   **           00066
**     LABADDIN takes precedence, so it will turn off both  **           00067
**     the LABLDUMP and READ (read only) options.  On the   **           00068
**     other hand, the STRIP and LABLDUMP options do not    **           00069
**     contradict each other.  So in that case, when STRIP  **           00070
**     and LABLDUMP are both set, COPYMODS will dump all    **           00071
**     the labels from the input tape to the LABLDUMP file, **           00072
**     while at the same time, it will strip them from the  **           00073
**     tape copies.  To get the exact effect you want from  **           00074
**     a COPYMODS run, just be very careful to code the     **           00075
**     correct combination of options.  Look at the OPTIONS **           00076
**     report before you mount the tapes.  (The OPTIONS     **           00077
**     report in //SYSPRINT will be complete before the     **           00078
**     tapes are mounted.)  To see the exact effect of      **           00079
**     the COPYMODS option correction, code the CODEDPRM    **           00080
**     option to obtain a comparison report of the options  **           00081
**     before COPYMODS correction has been done.            **           00082
**                                                          **           00083
**     Up to 132 bytes of the beginning n records of each   **           00084
**     tape file can be dumped in Hex, similarly to the     **           00085
**     way TAPESCAN does it (HEXPRT option).  Interpreta-   **           00086
**     tion of the printables in this hex dump can be       **           00087
**     either EBCDIC (default) or ASCII.  EBCDIC and ASCII  **           00088
**     are COPYMODS PARM or SYSIN keywords also.            **           00089
**                                                          **           00090
**     Support for ASCII tapes (ANSI/ISO Levels 3 and 4)    **           00091
**     has been added.  COPYMODS can init ASCII tapes       **           00092
**     with the INASC3 and INASC4 keywords.  Additionally,  **           00093
**     the other functions of COPYMODS such as LABLDUMP,    **           00094
**     LABADDIN, and READ work for ASCII tapes.  The HEXPRT **           00095
**     option with the ASCII keyword allows you to print    **           00096
**     tape records in hex, with an ASCII interpretation    **           00097
**     of the printables.  EOV2EOF works for ASCII tapes.   **           00098
**                                                          **           00099
**     COPYMODS will automatically read past any number     **           00100
**     of leading tape marks on a tape, and will copy       **           00101
**     any real data that is after them.  The leading       **           00102
**     tape marks can be included in the copied tapes       **           00103
**     (option LTMCOPY - default) or they can be skipped    **           00104
**     from the copied tapes and left off, so the real      **           00105
**     data will be at the beginning of the copied tapes    **           00106
**     (option LTMSKIP).                                    **           00107
**                                                          **           00108
**     See the "New Features" section below for some more   **           00109
**     details.  See the #MANUAL member of the install pds  **           00110
**     (CBT Tape File 229) for even more details.           **           00111
**                                                          **           00112
**  METHOD:  COPYMODS FIRST DETERMINES WHICH OUTPUT DD'S    **           00113
**    ARE PRESENT. THE INPUT TAPE IS READ, USING EXCP,      **           00114
**    INTO ONE BUFFER, AND THE APPROPRIATE OUTPUT TAPES     **           00115
**    ARE WRITTEN USING EXCP, FROM THAT SAME BUFFER.  ANY   **           00116
**    LABELS ON THE INPUT WILL BE COPIED. ANY LABELS ON     **           00117
**    THE OUTPUT TAPES WILL BE DESTROYED.  IF AN ERROR      **           00118
**    OCCURS ON THE INPUT TAPE, THE PROGRAM WILL ABEND      **           00119
**    WITH A USER 69 ABEND.  IF AN ERROR OCCURS ON AN       **           00120
**    OUTPUT TAPE, THE PROGRAM WILL QUIT WRITING TO THE     **           00121
**    TAPE WHICH ENCOUNTERED THE ERROR, AND WILL REPORT     **           00122
**    HOW MUCH DATA HAS BEEN CORRECTLY COPIED TO THAT       **           00123
**    PARTICULAR OUTPUT TAPE.                               **           00124
**                                                          **           00125
**    Any output DD names from //OUT1 thru //OUT16 may be   **           00126
**    coded in the execution JCL for COPYMODS, so that up   **           00127
**    to 16 output tapes may be created.  But, if none      **           00128
**    of these DD names is present, COPYMODS will force     **           00129
**    PARM=READ automatically, and it will issue a          **           00130
**    special message to //SYSPRINT saying that it did so.  **           00131
**                                                          **           00132
**  COPYMODS has some optional DD's which will be used      **           00133
**    if they are present.  These following DD's are used   **           00134
**    by the PARMCHEK program, when COPYMODS is executed.   **           00135
**                                                          **           00136

**    In addition, the COPYMODS program itself has some     **           00151
**    extra DD's, which are required if the appropriate     **           00152
**    options are set:                                      **           00153

**               that COPYMODS generates.  This DD name     **           00158
**               is necessary if the LABLDUMP option is     **           00159
**               in effect.                                 **           00160

**   COPYMODS - The main processing module, which contains  **           00214
**              most of the tape copy/reading processing.   **           00215

**   COPYMOPT - The separate routine which reads the PARM   **           00220
**              bits that have been set, and which prints   **           00221

**   PARMCHEK - All the PARM and SYSIN input processing is  **           00225
**              done here.  PARM bits are passed back to    **           00226

**   LABELCHK - Now a separate CSECT to check whether a     **           00234
**              record read by COPYMODS is part of a set    **           00235

**   MSGCSECT - Contains all the texts of the messages      **           00241
**              used by the COPYMODS CSECT.  Addressed      **           00242
**              by two new macros:  MVFMS which does        **           00243
**              operations on fields in the messages, and   **           00244
**              PTMS, which prints a message to SYSPRINT.   **           00245

**              Two new macros, ADRSMS and DROPMS, now can  **           00247
**              be used to address this area, and save      **           00248
**              a lot of addressability space, because      **           00249
**              normal assembler instructions can be used   **           00250
**              in between them, and the addressability     **           00251
**              will not be redundantly repeated.  The      **           00252
**              new PTMSN macro is PTMS without the         **           00253
**              addressability built in, to put in between  **           00254
**              ADRSMS and DROPMS.                          **           00255

**   FOOTAGE  - Code to calculate footage on a tape, as     **           00257
**              though the data were on a 6250 bpi reel.    **           00258
**              This code came from Florida Power Company   **           00259
**              SS0104 Tapemap program.  Used by the        **           00260

**  COPYMODS, PARMCHEK, and COPYMOPT are separate programs, **           00263
**  but they must be coordinated, and at the same level, so **           00264
**  to be safe, they should always be assembled together.   **           00265
**  The LABELCHK program has the same status.  It must be   **           00266
**  assembled together with the COPYMODS program.  Same     **           00267
**  with the PRINTLBL program and the FOOTAGE program.      **           00268
**                                                          **           00269

**  GENERAL OUTLINE OF PROGRAM CALLS                        **           00272
**  ------- ------- -- ------- -----                        **           00273

**  COPYMODS is the first program to get control.  The      **           00275
**  V-CONs for TRTCSECT and the PARMCHEK program are saved  **           00276
**  and the entry locations are stored in fullwords for     **           00277
**  later use.  Same for PRINTLBL and FOOTAGE entry points. **           00278
**                                                          **           00279
**  PARMCHEK is immediately called, and it opens //SYSIN    **           00280
**  if that ddname is present.  If //PARMREPT is present,   **           00281
**  it is also used by the PARMCHEK program.                **           00282
**                                                          **           00283
**  After PARMCHEK has returned all parm bit settings to    **           00284
**  COPYMODS and all user-quantities, the settings are      **           00285
**  examined by COPYMODS and inconsistent settings are      **           00286
**  adjusted:  For instance, if LABADDIN is on, LABLDUMP    **           00287
**  has to be turned off, because only one of these can be  **           00288
**  done in one run.  These inconsistencies are all fixed,  **           00289
**  and then COPYMODS processing starts.                    **           00290
**                                                          **           00291
**  (To examine the effect of the COPYMODS parm correction, **           00292
**  code the CODEDPRM option to obtain a "before and after" **           00293
**  option comparison report.)                              **           00294
**                                                          **           00295
**  COPYMOPT is called to display all the options that have **           00296
**  been set, if the OPTION parm has been set.  This is     **           00297
**  done to //SYSPRINT.  If any adjustments of options have **           00298
**  been made, you can see the final result in the SYSPRINT **           00299
**  report that has been produced by COPYMOPT.              **           00300
**                                                          **           00301
**  A PARM of CODEDPRM causes COPYMOPT to be called twice,  **           00302
**  once with the corrected parm bits, and the second time, **           00303
**  using the saved original parm bits, as returned by the  **           00304
**  PARMCHEK program.                                       **           00305
**                                                          **           00306
**  The //SYSPRINT DD is opened and closed by COPYMOPT,     **           00307
**  and opened again by COPYMODS.  This allows SYSPRINT     **           00308
**  to be viewed under SDSF before the tapes are mounted,   **           00309
**  so you can see the OPTIONS report(s) there.             **           00310
**                                                          **           00311
**  A significant note is, that the PARMREPT contains the   **           00312
**  options as they have been set by the PARMCHEK program,  **           00313
**  with no alteration.  The COPYMOPT call, which produces  **           00314
**  the OPTIONS display in //SYSPRINT, occurs after the     **           00315
**  adjustments for inconsistent parm settings has been     **           00316
**  made by COPYMODS.  If you want to see the effect of     **           00317
**  these adjustments, code the CODEDPRM keyword to obtain  **           00318
**  a comparison report showing the original options as     **           00319
**  originally coded.                                       **           00320
**                                                          **           00321
**  After that, COPYMODS does its things, depending on the  **           00322
**  options that have been set.  Most of the processing is  **           00323
**  done in the COPYMODS csect, except for the HEXPRT       **           00324
**  option, where the translation tables are in the         **           00325
**  TRTCSECT csect.                                         **           00326
**                                                          **           00327
**  The LABELCHK program is called whenever an 80-byte      **           00328
**  record is read, to see whether that record is part of   **           00329
**  a set of tape labels.                                   **           00330
**                                                          **           00331
**  Whenver a label is to be interpreted to SYSPRINT, the   **           00332
**  PRINTLBL program is called.                             **           00333
**                                                          **           00334
**  If the FOOTAGE keyword is used, the FOOTAGE program     **           00335

**       OFF INTO AN OUTPUT FILE.  THESE LABEL IMAGES HAVE  **           00401
**       EXTRA CONTROL CARDS ADDED.  THESE LABELS CAN BE    **           00402
**       MERGED WITH THE FILES IN AN NL VERSION OF THE      **           00403
**       SAME TAPE, AND A NEW SL TAPE CREATED.  BY DEFAULT, **           00404
**       BLOCK COUNTS IN THE EOF1 AND EOV1 OF THE OUTPUT    **           00405
**       TAPE ARE CORRECTED TO SHOW THE ACTUAL BLOCK        **           00406
**       COUNTS ON THE TAPE, BUT THIS ACTION CAN BE         **           00407

**  11a. IF YOU CODE A PARM OF SYSIN IN THE PARM FIELD OF   **           00410
**       THE EXEC CARD, THEN COPYMODS NOW TAKES PARM INPUT  **           00411
**       FROM SYSIN, AND THESE CAN OVERRIDE THE OTHER PARMS **           00412
**       IN THE EXEC CARD, BECAUSE SYSIN IS SEARCHED LATER. **           00413

**       (BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO CODE PARM=SYSIN IN THE PARM **           00415
**       FIELD OF THE EXEC CARD.  IF THE SYSIN DDNAME IS    **           00416
**       PRESENT IN THE JCL, PARMCHEK WILL OPEN IT, AND     **           00417

**       OUTVOLALL=volser , WILL CAUSE THE REST OF A SYSIN  **           00426
**       CARD TO BE IGNORED FOR PARMS FROM THE PARM TABLE.  **           00427
**                                                          **           00428
**  11c. OUTVOLALL=volser , STARTING IN COLUMN1 OF A SYSIN  **           00429
**       CARD, WILL CAUSE ALL OUTPUT VOL1 LABELS TO BE      **           00430
**       OVERWRITTEN WITH THE CODED VOLSER.  THE REST OF    **           00431
**       THAT CARD IS NOT SEARCHED FOR PARMS.               **           00432
**                                                          **           00433
**  12.  OVERLAYING OF THE VOLSER (IN THE VOL1 LABEL)       **           00434
**       CAN ALSO BE DONE IF YOU ARE ADDING EXTERNAL        **           00435
**       LABELS TO AN NL TAPE.  THE OUTPUT TAPES CAN        **           00436
**       HAVE DIFFERENT VOLSER'S FROM THE VOL1 LABEL        **           00437
**       IN THE EXTERNAL LABEL DATASET.                     **           00438
**                                                          **           00439
**  13.  LABLDUMP AND LABADDIN NOW TAKE IBM STANDARD USER   **           00440
**       LABELS (SUL) INTO ACCOUNT.  UP TO 8 UHLn AND/OR    **           00441
**       UTLn LABELS ALLOWED.  THEREFORE, YOU CAN MAKE A    **           00442
**       TAPE WITH ANY USER LABELS YOU WANT, EVEN THOUGH    **           00443
**       YOUR SYSTEM CAN'T CREATE SUCH A TAPE BY ITSELF.    **           00444
**       LABLDUMP DUMPS ALL THE LABEL RECORDS FROM AN SL    **           00445
**       TAPE TO AN EXTERNAL FILE (WITH SPECIAL CONTROL     **           00446
**       CARDS), AND LABADDIN CAN ADD THESE LABELS TO AN    **           00447
**       NL TAPE TO MAKE AN SL TAPE.  (OF COURSE, YOU CAN   **           00448
**       EDIT THE LABEL FILE ON DISK BEFORE USING IT TO     **           00449
**       CREATE A NEW SL TAPE FROM AN NL TAPE.)             **           00450
**                                                          **           00451
**  14.  DEFAULT ACTION OF COPYMODS WITH LABADDIN IS THAT   **           00452
**       IT IS "LABEL DRIVEN".  THAT IS, IF THERE ARE MORE  **           00453
**       NL TAPE FILES THAN EXTERNAL LABELS, THE PROGRAM    **           00454
**       STOPS WHEN IT RUNS OUT OF LABELS.  IF THERE ARE    **           00455
**       MORE LABEL SETS THAN FILES, THE OUTPUT TAPE IS     **           00456
**       WRITTEN WITH NULL STANDARD LABEL FILES UNTIL THE   **           00457
**       LABEL DATASET IS EXHAUSTED, EVEN AFTER THE LAST    **           00458
**       DATA FILE HAS BEEN WRITTEN.                        **           00459
**                                                          **           00460
**       A NEW OPTION CALLED NOEXNULL ALLOWS COPYMODS TO    **           00461
**       STOP AS SOON AS THE NL TAPE FILES ARE EXHAUSTED,   **           00462
**       EVEN IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL LABEL SETS IN THE     **           00463
**       EXTERNAL LABEL DATASET.                            **           00464
**                                                          **           00465
**  15.  WHEN DOING LABADDIN PROCESSING, IF THE LAST LABEL  **           00466
**       SET IN THE EXTERNAL LABEL FILE HAS A HDR1 AND A    **           00467
**       HDR2 LABEL, BUT NO ENDOFLABELHEADER AND NO EOF1    **           00468
**       AND NO EOF2, THE LBLFIX PARAMETER ALLOWS THE       **           00469
**       PROGRAM TO ACT AS IF THESE CONTROL CARDS WERE      **           00470
**       THERE.  THE EOF1 IS BUILT FROM THE HDR1 AND THE    **           00471
**       MEASURED BLOCK COUNT, AND THE EOF2 IS BUILT FROM   **           00472
**       THE HDR2.                                          **           00473
**                                                          **           00474
**  16.  COPYMODS CAN NOW INIT TAPES WITHOUT COPYING AN     **           00475
**       INPUT TAPE.  USE A PARM OF INITVOLS.  ASCII TAPES  **           00476
**       ARE INITTED WITH A PARM OF EITHER INASC3 OR        **           00477

**  17.  COPYMODS CAN NOW CHANGE THE OWNER INFORMATION      **           00482
**       IN THE VOL1 LABEL.  USE THE TAPEOWNER= KEYWORD     **           00483
**       IN A SYSIN CARD.  14 CHARACTER TAPE OWNERS ARE     **           00484
**       SUPPORTED FOR ASCII TAPES.  IBM SL TAPES HAVE      **           00485
**       10 CHARACTERS IN THE TAPE OWNER FIELD.             **           00486

**  18.  COPYMODS CAN LIMIT ITSELF IN THE NUMBER OF FILES   **           00488
**       COPIED, IF THE FILELIMIT=NN KEYWORD IS CODED IN    **           00489
**       SYSIN.  IF THE INPUT IS SL, THEN THE FILELIMIT     **           00490
**       IS INTERPRETED AS SL FILES, AND MULTIPLIED BY 3.   **           00491

**       INTERPRETATION OF FILE NUMBERS CAN BE FORCED,      **           00493
**       USING THE SLLIM PARM KEYWORD.  NL INTERPRETATION   **           00494

**  22.  COPYMODS CAN NOW DO A QUICK DUMP OF TAPE LABELS,   **           00528
**       WITHOUT READING THE TAPE DATA.  USE THE PARM OF    **           00529
**       LBDQUICK (WHICH IMPLIES READONLY), JUST TO DO      **           00530

**  23.  USING PARM=STRIP, COPYMODS CAN STRIP ALL LABELS    **           00534
**       FROM SL TAPES TO MAKE NL OUTPUT TAPES.  IF         **           00535
**       FILE LIMITING IS NOT IN EFFECT (NO FILELIMIT=nnn   **           00536
**       CARD IN SYSIN), THEN THE LABELS AND THE TAPE MARK  **           00537
**       THAT FOLLOWS EACH ONE, WILL NOT BE WRITTEN TO THE  **           00538
**       OUTPUT TAPE(S).  IT DOES NOT MATTER WHERE THE      **           00539
**       LABELS ARE, ON THE TAPE, SO IF YOU HAVE SOME KIND  **           00540
**       OF MESSED-UP TAPE WITH LABELS IN THE WRONG PLACE,  **           00541
**       THESE WILL STILL BE CORRECTLY STRIPPED OFF.  IF    **           00542
**       FILE LIMITING IS IN EFFECT, THEN THE INPUT TAPE    **           00543
**       IS ASSUMED TO BE SL, AND THE NUMBER CODED IN THE   **           00544
**       FILELIMIT=nnn SYSIN CARD IS MULTIPLIED BY 3, AND   **           00545
**       THE COPYING IS STOPPED AFTER THAT POINT OF THE     **           00546

**       FOR PARM=STRIP OPERATIONS, COPYMODS USES THE       **           00549
**       LABELCHK ROUTINE TO DETERMINE IF A TAPE FILE IS    **           00550
**       REALLY A LABEL, SO IT WILL STRIP OFF A LABEL FILE  **           00551
**       WHEREVER IT OCCURS.  THIS IS NOT LIKE THE COPYSLNL **           00552
**       PROGRAM, WHICH ASSUMES THAT EACH DATA FILE IS      **           00553
**       SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO LABEL FILES, AND WHICH      **           00554
**       DOES THE STRIPPING BY "COUNTING" AND NOT BY        **           00555

**       CARD AND HAVE THEREFORE INVOKED FILE LIMITING,     **           00559
**       YOU CAN FORCE THE nnn TO BE INTERPRETED AS NL,     **           00560
**       USING THE NLLIM PARM, AND YOU CAN FORCE THE nnn    **           00561
**       TO BE INTERPRETED AS SL (AND THEREFORE BE          **           00562

**       THEM AS UNCOMPRESSED, AND THE VIRTUAL TAPE LABELS  **           00569
**       DO NOT INDICATE TO MVS THAT IDRC IS ON.  THIS      **           00570
**       ALLOWS A 3420 OR 3480 VIRTUAL DEVICE TO READ THE   **           00571

**       SCANNING INSTEAD OF THE INLINE PARMCHK SUBROUTINE. **           00584
**       THEREFORE, THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE ASSEMBLED IN     **           00585
**       BATCH, TOGETHER WITH THE PARMCHEK PROGRAM.         **           00586
**       THIS ALSO ALLOWS OPTIONAL DDNAME //PARMREPT TO     **           00587

**  28.  SUPPORT FOR ANSI/ISO (ASCII) TAPES.  LEVELS 3 AND  **           00590
**       4 ARE SUPPORTED.  COPYMODS CAN INIT ASCII TAPES    **           00591
**       (KEYWORDS INASC3 AND INASC4), AND CAN PERFORM      **           00592
**       ALL ITS FUNCTIONALITY ON THEM.  14 CHARACTER TAPE  **           00593
**       OWNER FIELD IS SUPPORTED FOR ASCII TAPES, AS WELL  **           00594
**       AS MOST OF THE OTHER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASCII     **           00595

**       OFF IN THE COPIED TAPES USING THE SECOFF KEYWORD.  **           00599
**       THESE INDICATORS (TURNED OFF) ARE:                 **           00600

**       IF THESE HAD BEEN ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE ABOVE,   **           00604
**       THE SECOFF KEYWORD WILL CAUSE THEM TO BE RESET     **           00605
**       AS ABOVE, TO INDICATE NO DATASET PROTECTION.       **           00606

**       RACF OR OTHER SECURITY MAY OVERRIDE THESE LABEL    **           00608
**       SECURITY INDICATORS, BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO    **           00609
**       COMPLETELY TURN THEM OFF AT THE TAPE LABEL LEVEL.  **           00610
**       THE NOSECOFF KEYWORD NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE   **           00611

**  31.  COPYMODS CAN DISPLAY 6250 BPI FOOTAGES FOR THE     **           00622
**       FILES ON THE TAPE, USING THE FOOTAGE KEYWORD.      **           00623
**       FOOTAGE CALCULATIONS FOR EACH FILE, AS WELL AS     **           00624
**       FOOTAGE FOR THE ENTIRE TAPE, UP TO THE CURRENT     **           00625

**  32.  COPYMODS WILL DISPLAY MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM BLOCK    **           00628
**       SIZES FOR EACH TAPE FILE READ, WHEN THE MINMAX     **           00629

**  33.  COPYMODS CAN OPTIONALLY SHOW THE SIZE OF EACH      **
**       TAPE DATA BLOCK (TECHNICALLY CALLED A "RECORD")    **
**       ON THE TAPE, USING THE RECSIZE OPTION.  AS CODED   **
**       CURRENTLY, RECSIZE CAN PRODUCE A LOT OF SYSPRINT   **
**       OUTPUT, SINCE IT PRODUCES ONE LINE PER TAPE DATA   **
**       BLOCK.  THE RECSIZE OPTION DISPLAYS DETAILS,       **
**       WHICH THE MINMAX OPTION SUMMARIZES.  IF RECSIZE    **
**       IS CODED, THEN THE MINMAX OPTION IS FORCED ON.     **

**             EOVTOEOF now works for ASCII and IBM tapes,  **           01308
**             because a call to LABELCHK now returns the   **           01309
**             altered copy of INAREA to the main program.  **           01310
**             A parm of EOV2 now requires a space after    **           01311

** LEVEL 077 - Save addressability space by replacing       **           01359
**             multiple MVFMS invocations with ADRSMS and   **           01360
**             DROPMS macros, to get addressability to      **           01361
**             MSGCSECT, and keep it for a while.  Also     **           01362
**             further reduced the program size by making   **           01363
**             a PTMSN macro that doesn't re-do the         **           01364
**             addressability that PTMS does.  This is for  **           01365
**             putting in between a ADRSMS and a DROPMS.    **           01366
**                                                          **           01367
** LEVEL 078   Add CODEDPRM option to report PARM options   **           01368
**             before they were adjusted by COPYMODS.       **           01369
**                                                          **           01370
**             There was no way to turn off the INITVOLS    **           01371
**             option with a parm.  So I coded the NOINITVO **           01372
**             option, to turn off the INITVOLS option      **           01373
**             bit.  So tape init will only be in effect    **           01374
**             if INITVOLS is explicitly coded.  Report     **           01375
**             NOINITVO in the options report, if this      **           01376
**             option is set off.  Remember that coding     **           01377
**             the INITVOLS keyword also turns on the       **           01378
**             CHGVOL option, so that the JCL volser gets   **           01379
**             propagated into the newly initiated tape.    **           01380
**             Coding NOINITVO only turns off the INITVOLS  **           01381
**             parm bit, and not the CHGVOL bit, as this    **           01382
**             should be the proper way to do it.           **           01383
**                                                          **           01384
**             If no //OUTn DD cards are coded in the JCL,  **           01385
**             COPYMODS would have run through the WRITEs   **           01386
**             without writing, and it would look like a    **           01387
**             normal run.  The logical fix would be to     **           01388
**             force READONLY on, and say in a message      **           01389
**             that you have done so. (That's what I did.)  **           01390
**                                                          **           01391
** LEVEL 079   Added MINMAX option to report largest and    **           01392
**             smallest block sizes for each file read.     **           01393
**                                                          **           01394
** LEVEL 080   Added RECSIZE option to report individual    **
**             size of tape blocks, one at a time.  This    **
**             option produces one record in SYSPRINT for   **
**             each tape data block because it is reporting **
**             that block's size.  So this option should    **
**             not be a default since it makes a lot of     **
**             output.  Shows details of the MINMAX         **
**             display, so RECSIZE implies MINMAX.  If      **
**             RECSIZE is coded, MINMAX is switched on.     **
**                                                          **
**             Got rid of "SBG MM/YY" type comments.        **
**                                                          **
** LEVEL 081   Fix problem in PARM=STRIP code where a       **
**             label image in the middle of tape data was   **
**             stripped off.                                **
**                                                          **
** LEVEL 082   Fix problem in PARM=STRIP code where an      **
**             80-byte tape block would cause no tape mark  **
**             to be written at the end of the current      **
**             file.  Made STRIP diagnostics a separate     **
**             parm called DGSTRI and NODGSTRI.             **

**  AUTHOR:   Sam Golob                                     **           05951
**                                                          **           05952
**  PURPOSE:  This program converts keywords in a PARM      **           05953
**            field or in SYSIN, into bit settings that     **           05954
**            a program can use, to control options in      **           05955
**            its execution.                                **           05956
**                                                          **           05957
**            This program can be run as a subroutine       **           05958
**            which is called, to set up to 10 bytes of     **           05959
**            bits, up to 80 bits in all, based on the      **           05960
**            settings of keywords in a table.              **           05961
**                                                          **           05962
**            This routine makes it easy to put a lot of    **           05963
**            options into a program.  If you want to       **           05964
**            add options, or use other words in PARM or    **           05965
**            SYSIN to call the same options, all you       **           05966
**            have to do, is to change or add entries in    **           05967
**            a table.  There is no extra coding to be      **           05968
**            done.                                         **           05969
**                                                          **           05970
**            Keywords in the PARM or SYSIN areas do not    **           05971
**            have to be delimited by commas or spaces or   **           05972
**            anything else.  Although for clarity, I'd     **           05973
**            certainly recommend that you put commas or    **           05974
**            spaces between the PARM field keywords.       **           05975
**            Therefore, I'd also advise that when you      **           05976
**            design keywords to put into the table to      **           05977
**            designate options, that you make them         **           05978
**            significantly different from each other.      **           05979
**            There is a length field in the table,         **           05980
**            however, which gives you some more control    **           05981
**            in this area.                                 **           05982
**                                                          **           05983
**            From a calling program, it would be possible  **           05984
**            to call PARMCHEK twice, against two different **           05985
**            tables, to set 20 bytes of options, instead   **           05986
**            of 10 bytes of options, and so forth...       **           05987
**                                                          **           05988
**            This gives you the opportunity of having      **           05989
**            a tremendous number of options, set by        **           05990
**            keywords, in your program, without using      **           05991
**            up valuable "base register space" for such    **           05992
**            coding.                                       **           05993
**                                                          **           05994
**                                                          **           05995
**  METHOD:   Bits, in the 10 bytes of PARMFLGS, are set,   **           05996
**            from a table, based on assembled defaults.    **           05997
**            These default settings are then overridden    **           05998
**            from a scan of words in the PARM field of     **           05999
**            the EXEC card.                                **           06000
**                                                          **           06001
**            If a SYSIN DD card is present, its cards      **           06002
**            are scanned against the table entries, to     **           06003
**            further override the bit settings which       **           06004
**            have already been done by the defaults and    **           06005
**            the PARM field.                               **           06006
**                                                          **           06007
**            The main purpose of this routine is to set    **           06008
**            bits from words.  However, if you need some   **           06009
**            keywords with values, such as (for example)   **           06010
**            FILELIMIT=69  in your program, you may use    **           06011
**            the "user code" section of this program       **           06012
**            to code that stuff in, so that these special  **           06013
**            keywords can be coded in SYSIN.               **           06014
**                                                          **           06015
**            Two sample keywords expecting number values:  **           06016
**            FILELIMIT=nnn  or                             **           06017
**            LABELIMIT=mmm                                 **           06018
**            have been coded here, just to illustrate      **           06019
**            how the user coding might work.               **           06020
**                                                          **           06021
**            Search order is:  Defaults, then PARM in      **           06022
**            the EXEC card, then SYSIN.                    **           06023
**                                                          **           06024
**            As coded here, the FILELIMIT= and             **           06025
**            LABELIMIT= keywords in SYSIN have to be in    **           06026

**  AUTHOR:   Sam Golob                                     **           07093
**                                                          **           07094
**  PURPOSE:  This is a subroutine for programs which read  **           07095
**            tapes under BLP, so that tape label files     **           07096
**            would appear as ordinary files to the calling **           07097
**            program.  As file contents are passed to      **           07098
**            this program, LABELCHK detects whether they   **           07099
**            are tape labels, and tells the caller what    **           07100
**            type of labels they are.  If labels need to   **           07101
**            be interpreted, the PRINTLBL program is       **           07102
**            called.                                       **           07103
**                                                          **           07104
**  METHOD:   Label headers (usually the first 4 bytes)     **           07105
**            are scanned, and if a match to a known label  **           07106
**            type is found, then that type of label is     **           07107
**            processed appropriately.                      **           07108
**                                                          **           07109
**  Flags Set:  The principal flag set by this routine is   **           07110
**            the ISLABEL byte:                             **           07111
**                                                          **           07112
**   Setting of ISLABEL:   X'01'  - record is an IBM        **           07113
**                                  standard label          **           07114
**                                                          **           07115
**                         X'02'  - record is an ANSI/ISO   **           07116
**                                  (ASCII) standard label  **           07117
**                                                          **           07118
**                         X'00'  - the tested record is    **           07119
**                                  not a tape label        **           07120
**                                                          **           07121
**   Other flags and quantities are also set by this        **           07122
**   routine.  They are passed back to the caller in the    **           07123
**   LCHKPASS user area, in register 2.  Sometimes the      **           07124
**   PARMFLGS are changed.  These are passed back to the    **           07125
**   caller in register 1.  Sometimes the INAREA (record    **           07126
**   input area, usually containing a label image) is       **           07127
**   changed.  The altered label image is passed back to    **           07128
**   the caller in register 3.  At present, 80 bytes are    **           07129
**   passed back in register 3.                             **           07130
