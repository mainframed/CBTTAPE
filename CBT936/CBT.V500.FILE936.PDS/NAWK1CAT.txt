awk awk - pattern-directed scanning and processing language Ý ¨ Ý
¨ Ý | ¨ Ý ¨ scans each input for lines that match any of a set of
patterns specified literally in or in one or more files specified
as With each pattern there can be an associated action that  will
be  performed when a line of a matches the pattern.  Each line is
matched against  the  pattern  portion  of  every  pattern-action
statement;  the  associated  action is performed for each matched
pattern.  The file name means the standard  input.   Any  of  the
form is treated as an assignment, not a filename, and is executed
at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.  The
option  followed by is an assignment to be done before is execut-
ed; any number of options may be present.  The option defines the
input  field separator to be the regular expression An input line
is normally made up of fields separated by  white  space,  or  by
regular  expression  The  fields are denoted ..., while refers to
the entire line.  If is null, the input line is  split  into  one
field  per  character.  A pattern-action statement has the form A
missing means print the line; a missing pattern  always  matches.
Pattern-action  statements  are  separated  by  newlines or semi-

Statements  are  terminated  by  semicolons,  newlines  or  right
braces.  An empty stands for String  constants  are  quoted  " ",
with  the usual C escapes recognized within.  Expressions take on
string or numeric values as appropriate, and are built using  the
operators (exponentiation), and concatenation (indicated by white
space).  The operators ! ++ -- += -= *= /= %= ¬= > >= < <= ==  !=

array elements (denoted or fields.  Variables are initialized  to
the  null string.  Array subscripts may be any string, not neces-
sarily numeric; this allows for a  form  of  associative  memory.

Language,  Addison-Wesley, 1988.  ISBN 0-201-07981-X There are no
explicit conversions between numbers and strings.   To  force  an
expression  to be treated as a number add 0 to it; to force it to
be treated as a string concatenate "" to it.
The scope rules for variables in functions are a botch; the  syn-
tax is worse.
