 02-JAN-1999 - 01-MAR-1999 --------------------------------------------

 Updated:
 - DASRC.....Package of source library:
             - DA$ENQS now handles multi-system enqueue correctly
             - DA$BRODC was added: a SYS1.BRODCAST analyzer
             - DA$PDSR had misc (minor) changes

 Added:
 - NEWISPF...Rexx exec that makes Version 4 of ISPF look and act more
             like older versions.
 - COPYANSI..Rexx exec that filters an input file that has ANSI printer
             control charactes and translates them for PCs (except top
             of page).
 - HLASMTR...High Level Assembler Listing trimmer.  Good for when you
             are downloading a listing for printing on a PC printer.
             The title lines and trailing report stuff (like xref) are
             trimmed out.
 - D2SEQN....Death 2 Sequence Numbers - a filter that removes sequence
             numbers when copying records.  This makes printouts of
             source code easier to read. I use this when I printout
             JES2 source code for example.  PTF strings like "@THX1138"
             when found as the last word on a line are also removed.
             I find this really enhances my source code viewing
             pleasure.

 15-JUN-1998 - 28-AUG-1998 -------------------------------------------

 Added:
 - MPFEXITS..The MPF exits I use at my shop

 Updated:
 - CLIPBRD...An ISPF application that enhances the use of the IBM
             supplied ISRCUT and ISRPASTE edit macros.  Use the PASTEIT
             TSO command to paste information that is slightly larger
             than the ISPF edit screen on a blank ISPF panel.  The
             information on the blank screen are written to ISRPASTE
             friendly variables in your profile.  You then use the
             ISRPASTE edit macro to paste these lines into your ISPF
             edit dataset.

 28-MAY-1998 ---------------------------------------------------------
