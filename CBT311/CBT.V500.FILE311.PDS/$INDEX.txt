 --------  ----------  -----------
 $$README  Text        This file you are reading now.

 APFADD    Text        Uses the OSCMD exec (also included) to issue
                       a SETPROG APF ADD command to add a dataset to
                       the APF list dynamically;

 BENCHMRK  Text        Program that shows if there is any consideration
                       between using one method of doing the same thing
                       over another.  For Example, performance wise does
                       the GETMAIN use more or less CPU than the STORAGE
                       macro?

 BENCHMR1  Text        Sample output of BENCHMRK on a 9672-R56.
 BENCHMR2  Text        Sample output of BENCHMRK on a 2064-1C7.

 CATME     Text        Rexx exec that invokes DEFINE NONVSAM for
                       generic and system system symbolics. Good for
                       ISPF 3.4 vtoc lists.

 CA90S     Text        Rexx exec that invokes the Computer Associates
                       CA90s (TNGFW) diagnostic display programs.  Not
                       terribly useful.

 CBT$XREF  Text        First attempt at creating a CBT tape cross
                       reference utility.  This version creates
                       MVS/Quickref user database entries.  As it
                       is today, it isn't all that useful yet.

 COMPPDS   Text        Rexx exec that compares two PDS at the member
                       level. If a member exists in both PDSs, then
                       ISPF compare is invoked to compare at the record
                       level.
 COMPPDSJ  Text        JCL to run COMPPDS in batch

 COPYANSI  Text        Rexx exec that filters an input file that has
                       ANSI printer control charactes and translates
                       them for PCs (except top of page).

 DASRC     PDS Unload  A collection of mostly batch utility that I have
                       written over the years. Recommend putting in a
                       dataset with name "ibmuser.DA.SOURCE".

 DASRCV    XMIT        Additions to the DASRC file in LRECL > 80
                       RECFM=VB. Recommend putting in a
                       dataset with name "ibmuser.DA.SOURCEV".

 DIVER     PDS Unload  A very useless but fun ISPF application of an
                       animated stick figure known as MR. ASCII diving
                       into a pool.

 D2SEQN    Text        Death 2 Sequence Numbers - a filter that
                       removes sequence numbers when copying records.
                       This makes printouts of source code easier to
                       read. I use this when I printout JES2 source
                       code for example.  PTF strings like "@THX1138"
                       when found as the last word on a line are also
                       removed.  I find this really enhances my
                       source code viewing pleasure.

 FINDMOD   Text        Assembler program that searchs the normal search
                       order (JPA, LNKLST, LPALST, etc) for a module.

 HLASMTR   Text        High Level Assembler Listing trimmer.  Good
                       for when you are downloading a listing for
                       printing on a PC printer.  The title lines and
                       trailing report stuff (like xref) are trimmed
                       out.

 IMGCOPY   Text        REXX exec that copies all bytes from the SYSUT1
                       file to SYSUT2 when the concept of records is
                       not relevant.  Good for copying .GIF and .ZIP
                       files around on a mainframe.

 IMGINFO   Text        REXX exec that shows the size of GIF and JPG
                       files in a format suitable for web pages.

 ISGECMOM  PDS Unload  An (slight) enhancement to IBM's sample ISGECMON

 ISPFVAR   Text        REXX exec that shows all of the IBM supplied
                       ISPF variables (all/most vars up to ISPF 3.5)

 ISPF34L   Text        REXX exec that creates utility cards, job
                       streams from data set lists from ISPF 3.4. It
                       does not handle the whole volume listing very
                       well (as I just found out today).  It works best
                       on listings from a given HLQ.

 JES2EXIT  PDS Unload  Edited versions of my JES2 exits

 LASTUSE   Text        Only useful for shops that have CA-DISK (also
                       called (SAMS:DISK or DMS).  It shows the last
                       job that used the dataset and the date.

 MPFEXITS  PDS Unload  The MPF exits I use at my shop

 MVSVAR    Text        REXX exec that shows all of the IBM supplied
                       MVSVAR() function variables (TSO/E 2.5 or higher)

 NEWISPF   Text        Rexx exec that makes Version 4 of ISPF look
                       and act more like older versions.

 OSCMD     Text        Rexx exec that uses the CONSOLE command to issue
                       a MVS command.  You must have proper access to
                       the TSO CONSOLE command to use OSCMD.

 PROGXX    PDS Unload  ISPF edit macro that verifies the APF entries in
                       the SYS1.PARMLIB PROGxx member.

 SASGIF1   Text        Sample jobstream that creates a .GIF file using
                       SAS.

 SASGIF2   Text        Sample jobstream that creates a .GIF file (with
                       a transparent background) using SAS.

 SHOWFDR   PDS Unload  Small ISPF "dialog" that invokes the FDR
                       diagnostic ISPF-based display functions;

 SHOWMRO   Text        Assembler program that shows the currently active
                       CICS MRO regions via TSO TPUTs.

 SHOWSYM   PDS Unload  ISPF edit macro that shows the system sumbols on
                       you MVS version 5 or higher

 SMFEXIT   PDS Unload  Edited versions of my SMF exits

 SMPEPP    PDS Unload  REXX exec that processes your SMP/E APPLY
                       CHECK output for PTFs bypassed due to ACTION,
                       HOLD, DOC, etc.  A list is presented that makes
                       viewing of the HOLD Text an easy task.

 SPELLCHK  PDS Unload  ISPF edit macro that performs a spell check on
                       selected lines or the whole edit file.  SAS is
                       needed.

 SUBME     Text        REXX exec that submits the currently edited data
                       to the Job Entry Subsystem.  Used when ISPF
                       submit fails.

 SYSVAR    Text        REXX exec that shows all of the IBM supplied
                       SYSVAR() function variables

 TOD       PDS Unload  This package adds two features to pre-OS/390
                       JES2 to simulate the time of day functions
                       in the JES2 JOB log.

 VSMAP     Text        REXX exec that shows the Virtual Storage map.
                       The subroutine is good for inclusion in other
                       execs.

 XMITINFO  Text        REXX exec that shows some internal information
                       about a TSO XMIT file.  This exec is more useful
                       on a PC when trying to determine if a file is
                       actually a TSO XMIT file.  This is the first
                       phase of a project to create a PC program to
                       extract files and PDS members from a TSO XMIT
                       file.  XMITINFO does work on TSO.
