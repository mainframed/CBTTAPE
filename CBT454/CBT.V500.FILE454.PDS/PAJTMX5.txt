%Sorting the mail-boxes list.+

 To change the sort order of the list, enter the%SORT+command and (optionally)
 the desired sort fields as operands. If you enter no sort fields, MAIL DATE
 FIELD AUTHOR (in that order) will be used. You may enter as many of the sort
 fields as you wish. Note that the current sort order is always shown on the
 MAIL-LIST panel, and is printed in the heading when you print the mail-boxes
 list (LST command).
 Valid sort fields operands are :
    M, M(D), M(A), MAIL, MAIL(D), MAIL(A)
    D, D(A), D(D), DATE, DATE(A), DATE(D)
    F, F(A), F(D), FIELD, FIELD(A), FIELD(D)
    A, A(A), A(D), AUT, AUT(A), AUT(D), AUTHOR, AUTHOR(A), AUTHOR(D)
%REMARK :+by default, the sort sequence for MAIL is D (descending order), and
          for DATE, FIELD and AUTHOR is A (ascending order).
