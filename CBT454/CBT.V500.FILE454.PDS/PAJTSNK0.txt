%Tutorial - SNAKE - A program for TSO 3270 terminals ---------------------------
%Method :+the player depresses keys to indicate which direction the I should
          move. Money is gained by moving the I to a location occupied by a $,
          whereupon another $ will be randomly generated at a vacant location.
          Getting to "home" is achieved by moving the I to the location occupied
          by the # which does not move during a game. Getting "eaten" by the
          snake occurs when the snake's head moves to the location occupied by
          the I.
