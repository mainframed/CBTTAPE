+The%MAIL-BOXES+facility allows you to maintain an online list of news or
 changes communications. This process needs two data-sets :

%  1+- a mail-boxes data-set into which the news or changes communications
       are stored, and

%  2+- a mail-lists tables data-set into which a summary list of all the
       news or changes communications, stored in the mail-boxes data-set,
       is maintained (this table is stored as a member, so this data-set
       may be used for many mail-boxes data-sets).

%NOTE :+the first time you enter the%MAIL-BOXES+facility, specify the names
        you want, then further you will be prompted for data-sets allocation.
