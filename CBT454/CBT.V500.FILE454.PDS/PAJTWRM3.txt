%Tutorial - WORM - A program for TSO 3270 terminals ----------------------------
+         If the QUERY does'nt indicate Graphics Escape support then APL/graphic
          characters will not be used even if seven colours are.
          Terminal I/O can be speeded up with the use of "burst" mode. Instead
          of one TPUT per move a data stream of over 3K can be accumulated and
          sent in one TPUT. Eating a number also triggers a TPUT. "Burst" mode
          is only used in automatic mode.
          If file ISPTABL is allocated then the highest score is kept as user
          data (PFD STATS, not SPF) of member EWSBTA## (REVIEW will show PFD
          and SPF STATS) where ## is the number of lines that the screen has.
          If invoked as HALFWORM or HW, then only the top half (integer
          arithmetic) of the screen will be used. Naturally a different
          scoreboard member will be used. Similarly with QUARTERW and QW.
