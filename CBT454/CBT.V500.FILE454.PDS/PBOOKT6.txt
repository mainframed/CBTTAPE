%Printing the Manuals list entries or full entries.+
 To print the Manuals list entries or full entries, enter the%LST+ or%FULL+

 enter the desired destination and (or) SYSOUT class as operand(s) to the
 LST or FULL commands.
 For examples : LST A     or FULL A     = class A, destination LOCAL
                LST R7    or FULL R7    = class A, destination R7
                LST X R41 or FULL X R41 = class X, destination R41
                LST R3 A  or FULL R3 A  = class A, destination R3
 By default, the destination is LOCAL and the SYSOUT class is A.
