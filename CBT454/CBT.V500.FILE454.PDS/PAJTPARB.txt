%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD                                                             +

           Example :
                  COMMAND ===>
                  =COLS> ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+--
                  000003 //*  THIS IS A DEMAND DEPOSIT JOB.            *
                  000004 //*    IT RUNS WEEKLY, EVERY MONDAY, ROLLING  *
                  000005 //* FORWARD IF MONDAY IS A HOLIDAY.           *
           In this example, you don't want the //* and the * to be included in
           your new paragraph, so you code :
                 %COMMAND ===> PARA OL=4 OR=46 NL=4 NR=45+
                  =COLS> ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+--
            %---> CC+003 //*  THIS IS A DEMAND DEPOSIT JOB.            *
                  000004 //*    IT RUNS WEEKLY, EVERY MONDAY, ROLLING  *
            %---> CC+005 //* FORWARD IF MONDAY IS A HOLIDAY.           *
           to exclude them from the reformatted paragraph. Don't forget to
           change them back if you switch from JCL to a memorandum.
