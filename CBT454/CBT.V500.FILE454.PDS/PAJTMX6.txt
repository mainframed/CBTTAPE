 To print the mail-boxes list, enter the%LST+command in the command area at
 the top of the screen. All the information currently contained on mail-boxes

 enter the desired destination and (or) SYSOUT class as operand(s) to the
 LST command. For examples : LST A     = class A, destination LOCAL
                             LST R7    = class A, destination R7
                             LST X R21 = class X, destination R21
                             LST R3 A  = class A, destination R3
 By default, the destination is LOCAL and the SYSOUT class is A.
