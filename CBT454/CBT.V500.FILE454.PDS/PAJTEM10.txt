%AUTOLIST :+
+  Use%AUTOLIST+to turn AUTOLIST mode on or off ("ON" is the default).
   If AUTOLIST mode is on, data is automatically formatted and written to the
   ISPF file when it is saved. The list file is normally printed when you exit
   from ISPF. If AUTOLIST mode is off, data is not written to the list file.
   If you want to maintain hardcopy listings of the latest versions of your
   program source, you should set AUTOLIST on. Then the listings will be
   created automatically.

   More topic will be presented in the EDIT tutorial.
