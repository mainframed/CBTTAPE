                              With   some
                            ingenuity,  you
                          can          create
                        paragraphs    in   many
                      different styles.   You can
                    create  impact  by  the  visual
                  appearance  of  your  writing,  and
                make your  letters  and  memoranda more
                effective.  True, visual appearance can
                  never replace the lasting impact of
                    content,  but  it  can increase
                      the attention people pay to
                        your   letters.   After
                          all,   didn't   you
                            read this  far?
