%RECOVERY :+
   Use%RECOVERY+to turn RECOVERY mode on or off.
   If RECOVERY mode is on when a system crash occurs, automatic recovery will
   take place the next time that you attempt to use edit.
   RECOVERY mode is remembered in your edit profile. The default setting for
   a new edit profile is RECOVERY off.
   If any changes have been made to the data, turning RECOVERY mode on causes
   the data to be immediately written to a temporary%backup+file. If no changes
   have been made to the data, turning RECOVERY mode on simply changes the
   current edit profile. When the first change is made to the data, it is then
   written to the backup file.

   More topic will be presented in the EDIT tutorial.
