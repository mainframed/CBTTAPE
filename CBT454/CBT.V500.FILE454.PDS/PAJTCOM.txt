%Tutorial - COMPARE - Compare Sequentials or Members ---------------------------
+
% Purpose+: Compare two sequential data-sets or members.
+           The compare is done by either the YALE COMPARE program (COMPAREB)
+           or by the IBM COMPARE utility program (IEBCOMPR).
+           The SYSPRINT messages are written to wherever FILENAME(SYSPRINT)
+           is allocated - usually to the terminal.
+ Optionally, supply :
+                FULL     - include the sequence numbers (YALE pgm).
+                ASM      - comparing assembler source code (YALE pgm).
+                IEBCOMPR - the IEBCOMPR utility is to be used.
+                SYSOUT   - messages to a SYSOUT data-set.
+                PRINT    - messages to terminal (default).
+                NOPRINT  - messages to dummy file.
+                BROWSE   - messages in browse to terminal.
+                ..name.. - messages to specified DDname.
+           When volume serials are used to indicate two identically named
+           data-sets on different volumes are being used, unexpected results
+           can occur unless both are specified.
+ File IGNORE : is optional. If it is available, then it is used to help
+               control the possible desynchronization problems.
