+          ____________
0             DYNAM provides an interface between a high level language
           such as COBOL or PLI, and SVC 99, the system dynamic alloca-
           tion  routine.    It  allows  the  user  to  acquire  system
           resources as the need arises and  free them when they are no
           longer required.  DYNAM  takes  simple parameters consisting
           of character strings and translates them into the text units
           required by  SVC 99.   In addition,   a special  information
           retrieval function can be called to provide all the informa-
           tion available about a particular allocation.  This informa-
           tion is returned in a fixed format data structure.  For more
           information about SVC 99 refer to the IBM manual:

+          WORK AREA
+          ____ ____
0             The first parameter to DYNAM is a workarea.   This worka-
           rea can be supplied  by the user or can be  obtained for the
           user by DYNAM. If obtained by DYNAM it can be used by subse-
           quent calls to DYNAM and freed later, or can be acquired and
           freed on the same call.
0             If the user supplies a work  area,  the first word of the
           work area must contain the length in bytes.

                     CALL 'DYNAM' USING WORK . . .
0             If DYNAM is to supply its own work area, this can be done
           explicitly by coding:
0               DCL WORK    FIXED BIN(31) INIT(0);
                CALL DYNAM (WORK, 'INIT')
0             WORK then becomes  a reference to the  acquired work area
           and must  be specified on all  subsequent calls to  DYNAM as
           the first parameter.  The workarea can later be free by cod-
           ing:
0               CALL DYNAM (WORK, 'END')
0             If dynam is to acquire a  workarea to be used only during
           one invocation,  the workarea is implicitly acquired by cod-
           ing:
0               CALL DYNAM (0, . . .)
0             This is  used when the  programmer only wants  to perform
           one dynamic allocation and then continue with his program.

+          __________
0             The second parameter to DYNAM describes the operation you
           wish to perform.    There are two different  types of opera-
           tions:  those  that have to  do with dynamic  allocation and
           those that have to do with the interface itself.
0               Interface Operations
                INIT     - aquire a work area
                END      - free the work area previously acquired by INIT
0               Allocation Operations
                ALLOC     - allocate a dataset
                UNALLOC   - unallocate a dataset
                CONCAT    - concatenate 2 or more DD names
                UNCONCAT  - unconcatenate previously concatenated DD names.
                REMOVE    - remove in-use attribute
                DDALLOC   - allocate a DD name
                INFO      - retrieve information about an allocation

+          OPERANDS
+          ________
0             The  third  and  subsequent  parameters  supply  operands
           needed to perform dynamic allocation.  Only one operand par-
           ameter is required  but it is sometimes convenient  to use a
           larger number, for example when obtaining allocation parame-
           ters from  a user  at a terminal  in an  interactive manner.
           Normal OS linkage  conventions flag the last  parameter in a
           parameter list so a variable  number of parameters is easily
           allowed if the high level host language supports it. Operand
           parameters must be delimited on the right by a semicolon.
0             Operands consist of a keyword and an optional value.   if
           a value  is present it is  separated from the keyword  by an
           equals (=)  sign.  Operands are separated from each other by
           one of more spaces and an operand string is delimited on the
           right by  a semicolon.    If a  keyword requires  a list  of
           values, the values in the list are separated by a comma.
0             Keywords may be  abbreviated by specifying enough  of the
           keyword so that it is unambiguous.  In cases where an entire
           keyword is  the same as  the first  few letters of  a longer
           keyword, ambiguity is resolved by picking the first keyword.
           In describing  DYNAM keywords below the  unambiguous portion
           of the keyword is written in uppercase.
0             An attempt has  been made to minimize the  number of key-
           words that require values.

0             This operation is equivalent to dataset allocation during
           job step  initialization;  the  parameter list  to DYNAM  is
           equivalent to a DD statement.   You  can request most of the
           JCL services that you can code on a DD statement.   In addi-
           tion you can  specify dataset passwords which do  not have a
           JCL equivalent.   The following is  a list of JCL parameters
           and the equivalent DYNAM keyword.

           well as in  the second word of  the workarea if one  is pro-
           vided.   The  use of register 15  allows a COBOL  program to

           ter RETURN-CODE and allows the same  for PLI through the use

           allows FORTRAN and  PASCAL to call DYNAM as  a function that

           then messages are written to the job log and the return code
           from SVC 99 is returned to the user.  If DYNAM itself fails,
