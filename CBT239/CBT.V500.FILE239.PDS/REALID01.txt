   Another purpose of line DROP command is the erasure of the specified base
register from project. The corresponding USING command will be erased from
project. You may delete all 'such' base registers via primary command DROP but
if there are few USINGs in project sharing the same base then line DROP is the
best way to delete only one of them.

   The format of this kind of the line DROP command is:
  %D  + - delete all USING statements from "this row's" offset.

   %1+- Reasm line    commands
   %2+- Reasm primary commands
