  Debug commands were invented for the developer's own needs in order to
simplify his hard job.  I do not expect anybody will use these commands.
However, to be honest, I document them.

  The following topics are presented in sequence, or may be selected by number:

  %#SNAP      + - Snap internal data base
  %TRACE      + - Switch trace on/off

)PROC
   &ZSEL = TRANS(&ZCMD
                #SNAP,       REAPR#00
                TRACE,       REAPRT00
                )
&ZUP   = REA00000
)END
