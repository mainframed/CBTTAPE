              FASTPATH Utility Program for ISPF
              ---------------------------------



    INTRODUCTION

*FASTPATH* is a multi-function utility program which allows a TSO user
to take advantage of the fast-path command facility in ISPF without
having to set up or modify the existing ISPF environment. *FASTPATH*
temporarily installs its own commands in the ISPF command table and
provides 30 built-in functions to support them.

*FASTPATH* is written in assembler. It is a free program, available in
source-code and load-module format in the freeware
<http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/> section of this Web site.


    OVERVIEW

*FASTPATH* was originally designed for consultants and application
programmers who often are not allowed to customize the ISPF environment
in which they have to work. To use *FASTPATH*, the TSO user must be able
to install (or update) a load-library on MVS and issue a TSO command
from within ISPF; that's all.

For example, let's assume that you just logged on TSO as JOHNDOE using a
LOGON procedure and ISPF set-up you know nothing about. You transfer
CBTTAPE.FILE183.LOAD
<http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/FILE183.LOAD-LINKMAP.html> to your MVS
system, then activate *FASTPATH* by issuing the
TSO CALL 'CBTTAPE.FILE183.LOAD(FASTPATH)' command, which returns to you
with the "ISPCMDS Updated" message in the upper right hand corner of the
ISPF screen. If you press the HELP key at this time, you get a long
message that indicates the name of the commands that have been added to
the in-storage copy of the ISPF command table (ISPCMDS).

At this point, *FASTPATH* has initialized itself by doing the following:

 1. make itself resident in memory for the rest of the ISPF session
 2. add a set of fast-path commands to your own in-storage copy of
    ISPCMDS; these commands are:

     Function | Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
     BR       | Browse Entry Panel
     CALendar | Display pop-up calendar
     CONNECT  | Connect to your Workstation
     CNTL 0   | Edit your ISPCTL0 or SPFTEMP0.CNTL data set
     CNTL     | Edit the current ISPCTLn or SPFTEMPn.CNTL data set

     FSTso    | TSO full-screen command (was TSOFS)
     ICS      | ISPF Command Shell (opt 6)
     IND$FILE | IND$FILE command (this allows you to transfer files to/
              | from your PC without having to go to TSO READY or opt 6)
     LC       | Full-screen LISTCAT
     LISTBc   | LISTBC command
     LOAD     | Load a program in memory

     TIME     | Display time, date and julian date
     TSOCmd   | TSO command
     UNLOAD   | Remove a program from memory
     UTil     | Utility Selection Panel (PDF opt 3)
     VERAse   | Remove a variable from the Shared and/or Profile pool.
     VI       | View Entry Panel (ISPF V4)
     WP       | Work-Place (Opt 11 in ISPF V4R2)
     X2D      | Convert a hexadecimal value to decimal
     ZDEL     | Display and set the ZDEL variable

 3. make specific TSO, ISPF and SDSF modules resident to improve
    performance
 4. start a timer to prevent the TSO session from timing out (if
    *FASTPATH* has been assembled with the SYSPARM(STOP522) option)

You're all set to use *FASTPATH*. Here are some of the capabilities
you can take advantage of:

 1. Command Stacking

    Enter ED and the EDIT Entry Panel appears on top of the current
    screen; Enter UT 4 and the Data Set List panel comes up. Enter any
    of the fast-path commands listed above to activate a new function on
    top of the current one. The number of functions you can "stack" in
    this fashion is only limited by the REGION parameter you specified
    at LOGON; to unstack, use the END, RETURN or CANCEL key.

 2. Command Stacking with Dsname or Tag

    Enter a data set name after the ED, BR, VI or WP commands to
    directly process the specified data set or PDS member; for example,
    entering the VI 'SYS1.PROCLIB(JES2)' command allows you to VIEW the
    JES2 procedure.

    Enter a character string (a "tag") after the ED, BR, VI or WP
    commands and the values you enter will be associated with the tag.

    For example, enter ED JCL and enter the values JOHNDOE USER JCL in
    the Project, Group and Type fields; from that point on, each time
    you invoke the ED, BR, VI or WP with the JCL tag, *FASTPATH* will
    present the same values to you, which you can change at any time.
    For the UT (utilities) and SD (SDSF) commands, the tag is the
    sub-option for the command; for example, UT 4 takes you to the Data
    Set List panel (PDF opt 3.4); SD H gets you directly into the SDSF
    Held Output Display.

 3. Cursor-driven Command Stacking

    Enter BR in the command field, move the cursor under a data set name
    currently appearing on your screen and press ENTER. *FASTPATH*
    extracts the data set name from the screen and invokes BROWSE. This
    feature works with ED, BR, VI, WP and LC.


    Installing FASTPATH

*FASTPATH* works on MVS/ESA V4R3, MVS/ESA V5, OS/390 and z/OS. Four
different installation procedures can be used for *FASTPATH*. The choice
is determined by the degree of commitment of the tech support staff
toward *FASTPATH*: cold, lukewarm, hot.

 1. Low-impact installation

    The easiest installation method consists in linking *FASTPATH* into
    a load-library that is *not* in the normal search sequence, i.e. not
    present in the ISPLLIB, STEPLIB or system concatenations. In this
    case, the user must invoke *FASTPATH* via the TSO CALL command at
    the beginning of each ISPF session.

 2. Medium-impact installation

    In this scenario, *FASTPATH* is link-edited into a load-library that
    is in the normal search sequence, i.e. present in the ISPLLIB,
    STEPLIB, TSOLIB or system concatenations. Users who want to take
    advantage of the *FASTPATH* facilities must invoke it once, via the
    TSO FASTPATH command, at the beginning of each ISPF session.

 3. Medium-high-impact installation

    In this scenario also, *FASTPATH* is link-edited into a load-library
    that is in the normal search sequence, and the ISPF star-up command
    is modified to execute *FASTPATH*; example:

     ISPSTART PGM(FASTPATH) PARM(SELECT PANEL(MAINMENU))

 4. High-impact installation

    In this scenario also, *FASTPATH* is link-edited into a load-library
    that is in the normal search sequence, and the technician in charge
    of ISPF installation customizes the ISPCMDS table (or the site table
    in ISPF 4.2) to make fast-path commands permanently available. Users
    no longer have to invoke *FASTPATH* at the beginning of their ISPF
    session to activate fast-path commands. Note that initialisation
    functions (such as PRELOAD and STOP522) are not available in this
    scenario.


    Invoking FASTPATH

*FASTPATH* can be invoked as a TSO command or as a program. Depending on
how it is invoked, *FASTPATH* will execute an initialisation procedure
or perform a function.

 1. Initialisation is performed when *FASTPATH* is invoked as a command,
    as a program with PARM='', or as a program with R1=0.
      * When *FASTPATH* is invoked as a TSO command, the following
        initialisation routines are executed:

         o  PRELOAD
         o  RESET
         o  STOP522
         o  ISPCMDS

      * When *FASTPATH* is invoked as a program (without a parm), the
        following initialisation routines are executed:

         o  PRELOAD
         o  RESET
         o  STOP522

        Initialisation only occurs once during an ISPF session. As part
        of the initialisation procedure, *FASTPATH* makes itself
        resident in memory until ISPF terminates. If a new version of
        *FASTPATH* is link-edited, it is not accessible to a user who
        has already initialized it, because the in-storage copy has
        precedence over any other version. However, you may issue
        TSO FASTPATH at any time to receive a message indicating what
        fast-path commands are available. You may also delete the
        in-storage copy of *FASTPATH* by entering the UNLOAD FASTPATH
        command on each of the ISPF logical screens currently open.
        Then, by entering TSO FASTPATH, you can install the updated
        version of *FASTPATH*.

      * When *FASTPATH* is invoked via the CALL command with PARM=CRASH,
        then initialisation functions are not performed. This feature,
        new in release 139, allows a TSO user to exit ISPF and execute
        their own set-up CLIST even when their installation forces
        LOGOFF when ISPF is exited.

 2. function Processing is performed when *FASTPATH* is invoked as a
    program with a parm that request a specific function (see parm
    format, below).

        Conflicts between *FASTPATH* and TSO commands

Some *FASTPATH* commands have the same name as TSO/E commands. This can
be an issue if a user wants to enter a TSO command such as NETSTAT in
the ISPF Command Shell (PDF opt 6). ISPF provides two ways around this
problem:

  * prefix the command with the greater-than sign: >NETSTAT DEVL
  * use the TSO command: TSO NETSTAT DEVL


        Execute commands in a new logical screen

In ISPF 4.2 and above, a user can direct *FASTPATH* commands to execute
in a new logical screen using one of the following methods:

 1. with the ISPF START command: START BR 'sys1.samplib'
 2. by appending a + sign to the command: BR 'sys1.samplib' *+*
 3. by creating new commands in ISPCMDS; for example:

     ISPCMDS VERB=BRS,                                                 X
      TRUNC=0,                                                         X
      ACT='SELECT PGM(ISPSTRT) PARM(BR &ZPARM) SUSPEND',               X
      DESC='Start BROWSE in a new screen'


    INITIALISATION FUNCTIONS


      1. ISPCMDS

The ISPCMDS adds a set of fast-path commands to the in-storage copy of
the ISPCMDS table. The commands are defined in a table at the end of the
*FASTPATH* program. Example:

     ISPCMDS VERB=SDsf,                                                X
      TRUNC=2,                                                         X
      ACT='SELECT PGM(FASTPATH) PARM(SDSF,&ZPARM)',                    X
      DESC='Fast Path Command: SDSF'

Before adding a command to ISPCMDS, *FASTPATH* checks for an existing
command with the same name (homonym) and, if one is found, deletes it.
In ISPF 4.2 and above, *FASTPATH* also checks and deletes homonyms
commands when they exist in the "user" and "site" tables.


      2. PRELOAD

The purpose of the PRELOAD routine is to speed up access to some
re-entrant programs (such as PDF Edit and Browse) which normally reside
in system libraries (LPA or link-list). The PRELOAD processing is driven
by an in-line table which can be customized by the user.

o For LPA modules, PRELOAD creates an entry in the Job Pack Area (JPAQ).
When LOAD, LINK, ATTACH or XCTL is issued, MVS looks in the JPAQ for a
useable copy of the module. If one is found there, I/O is reduced
because the ISPLLIB and STEPLIB directories do not need to be searched.
The following programs are among the LPA modules processed by PRELOAD:

 ISRBRO   PDF 1
 ISREDIT  PDF 2
 ISRUDA   PDF 3.1 & 3.2
 ISPEXEC  ISPF application interface
 IRXEXEC  REXX interpreter
 IRXSTAMP REXX stack manager

o Other re-entrant modules (link-list, ISPLLIB, STEPLIB, etc), are made
permanently resident in the user's address-space. This can improve
performance because no directory searches or module loads are required
when these programs are invoked. It can also increase paging activity;
therefore, pre-loading non-LPA modules should be used with caution.

o Other modules can be pre-loaded from the tasklib when *FASTPATH* is
initialized using the CALL command (see "low-impact Installation"
above). In this case, *FASTPATH* can pre-load modules that are present
in the library from which it executes. These modules can be RENT or
REUS.

NOTE: Pre-loading of PLPA modules in available in MVS/ESA 4.3 and above.
This function uses undocumented formats of the LOAD and IDENTIFY macros
to clone the LPDE, create two CDEs and one XTLST for each module and
chain the CDEs to the JPAQ. Note that the modules themselves are not
duplicated, the only version that exists is the one in PLPA; all that
PRELOAD does is create entries in the JPAQ that point to the PLPA
modules.

3. RESET EDIT Macro

*FASTPATH* issues the IDENTIFY macro to define the RESET entry point as
a program. When RESET is executed as an EDIT macro, it issues the
following statements:

 ISREDIT MACRO
 ISREDIT RESET

This allows you to specify !RESET as an initial macro without having to
have a program by that name anywhere. /This is no longer needed in ISPF
V5 where any EDIT command can be specified as initial macro./

4. STOP522

This function establishes a recurring timer that prevents system
time-out abends (S522) between the hours of 08:00 and 19:00 to keep the
TSO session active. STOP522 sets its timer interval just one minute
shorter than the SMF Job Wait Time (JWT); for example, if the JWT is set
to 0030 (30 minutes), STOP522 uses a 29-minute interval.

The STOP522 function has two requirements:

 1. SYSPARM(STOP522) must be specified when *FASTPATH* is assembled.
 2. *FASTPATH* must execute in a TSO/E 2.4 environment (or above).


    FASTPATH Commands


      The ED, BR, VI and WP commands

The BR, VI, ED and WP commands produce five different results:

 1. Display the corresponding PDF Entry panel on top of the currently
    displayed application, or
 2. Invoke the Browse, View or Edit PDF service (or the ISPF Work-place)
    using the data set name specified in the command, or
 3. Invoke the View or Edit PDF service for a Work-station file whose
    name is specified in the command, or
 4. Display the Reference Data Set List and, when the user selects an
    entry, invoke the Browse, View or Edit PDF service (or the ISPF
    Work-place) for the corresponding data set, PDS member or
    Work-station file, or
 5. Invoke the Browse, View or Edit PDF service (or the ISPF Work-place)
    using the data set name under which the cursor is positionned when
    the user presses ENTER. This technique is often called
    "point-and-shoot".

The BR, VI, ED and WP commands invoke the following *FASTPATH*
functions: BROWSE, EDIT, VIEW and WP. *FASTPATH* always switches to
NEWAPPL(ISR) to ensure predictable PFK configuration.

 1. Display the PDF Entry Panel

    If the BR, VI, ED and WP command is entered without any parameter,
    *FASTPATH* displays the corresponding PDF entry panel. For example,
    if the user enters BR, the BROWSE Entry Panel is displayed in
    ISPF/PDF V3 and, in ISPF V4, the View Entry Panel is displayed with
    a / in the Browse Mode choice. If the user enters ED, then the Edit
    Entry panel is displayed.

    If the user specifies a tag such as J or ABCDEF along with the
    command, *FASTPATH* displays the corresponding entry panel with the
    values that were specified the last time the same tag was specified.

    For example, user JOHNDOE enters ED J, fills the Project, Group and
    Type fields with JOHNDOE, USER and JCL. Each time user JOHNDOE
    issues BR J, or VI J, or ED J, or WP J, the corresponding entry
    panel comes up with JOHNDOE, USER and JCL in the Project, Group and
    Type fields.

    *FASTPATH* keeps track of most of the fields on the entry panel,
    namely Project, Group (1 to 4), Type, Initial Macro, Format, and
    Browse Mode.

    For the Workplace, *FASTPATH* also keeps track of the last View
    (Library or Data set), the object name and volume serial.

    When a tag is specified for the first time, *FASTPATH* checks the
    catalog for an existing data set, using a dsname built by
    concatenating the TSO prefix to the tag. If the data set exists,
    *FASTPATH* treats the tag as a partially-qualified dsname and
    invokes the ISPF function directly.

    *FASTPATH* saves the tags and associated data in profile variables,
    using names EDBR0000, EDBR0001, etc. The user can clean unwanted
    variables from the profile using PDF option 7.3 or the VERASE
    <http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/FASTPATH.html#verase> command.

 2. Explicit data set name

    The user can specify a partially or fully qualified data set name
    which may include a member name. For example, the user may enter
    BR CLIST, ED 'USER.CLIST' or VI CLIST(XXX*). When this format is
    used, *FASTPATH* directly invokes the corresponding ISPF service
    without displaying the service's entry panel.

    If a partially-qualified data set name is specified, *FASTPATH*
    checks the catalog for the name obtained by prefixing the TSO
    prefix; if the name is found, then it is used. If the prefixed data
    set name is not found, then *FASTPATH* uses the name as specified,
    i.e. without the TSO prefix. For example, if the current TSO prefix
    is JOHNDOE and the user enters BR SYS1.PROCLIB, then *FASTPATH* will
    access JOHNDOE.SYS1.PROCLIB if it exists, SYS1.PROCLIB otherwise.

    Uncataloged data sets can be accessed by specifying the volume
    serial number as part of the dsname; two formats are available:

     1. dsname/volser - example: BR SYS1.CMDLIB/OLDRES
     2. volser:dsname - example: BR OLDRES:SYS1.CMDLIB

    Instead of a dsname, the user may specify an asterisk, which
    *FASTPATH* interprets as "the last data set name explicitely
    specified".

    *FASTPATH* saves the dsname and volser in the BRDSN, BRMEM and BRVOL
    profile variables, for compatibility with the CNAEBROW and CNAEEDIT
    public-domain CLISTs.

    Note: If the ISPF BROWSE service fails and the BR command
    <http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/BR.html> is available, *FASTPATH*
    invokes it. The BR command <http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/BR.html> is
    able to process data set formats that are not normally supported by
    the ISPF BROWSE service, such as VSAM, BDAM, empty data sets,
    multi-volumes, etc.

 3. Work-station file name

    The user can specify the name of a file on the work-station to which
    he is connected using the ISPF Work-station agent. This function,
    which requires ISPF V4R2, only works with Edit and VIEW.

    For *FASTPATH* to properly identify a work-station file, the name
    must start with:

     1. a slash: ED /etc/user.text
     2. a drive identifier: VI C:\config.sys
     3. a tilde: ED ~myfile.conf

 4. Reference Data Set List

    If the parameter entered in the BR, VI, ED or WP command consists of
    a single slash character ("/"), *FASTPATH* displays the Reference
    Data Set List; the user can select one of the data set names to be
    processed as specified by the command entered.

 5. Point-and-shoot

    If the command is entered without a parameter and *FASTPATH* detects
    that the cursor is positionned under a data set name, then the
    dsname is extracted and passed to the corresponding function.

    For example, if the user enters BR, VI or ED, moves the cursor under
    a dsname appearing on the screen and hits ENTER, the corresponding
    data set or PDS member is automatically browsed, viewed or edited.
    If WP is entered instead, the Work Place view is switched to Data
    Set and the Work Place panel is displayed with the dsname placed in
    the "Object Name" field.

    Dsname Extraction Rules:

      * the dsname must appear in totality on the screen and can not be
        on a message line or in a message window
      * the data set must be cataloged
      * the dsname can include a member name
      * the dsname can be enclosed in apostrophes (single quotes) or
        surrounded by parentheses
      * the dsname can be in upper-case, lower-case or mixed-case
      * the dsname can contain a relative generation number, such as
        (+1) or (-2)
      * the member name can be generic, i.e. contain asterisks or
        percent signs

    The following figure shows examples of data set names and the
    "hot-zone" (marked with hyphens) under which the cursor must be
    positionned for proper extraction of the data set name.

    If the dsname contains a relative generation number or generic
    member name, then the "hot-zone" only includes the dsname portion of
    the name.

            EDSN(JOHNDOE.EXEC)            ((JOHNDOE.DDIR))
                --------------            ----------------

        JOHNDOE.CLIST(LOGPROC)        (JOHNDOE.ISPF.ISPPROF(ISREDIT)
        ----------------------        ------------------------------

        dsn (johndoe.clist )          'johndoe.ispf.ispprof(isr*)'
            --------------            ---------------------

        DSN=JOHNDOE.CLIST(PDF44)      DSNAME='JOHNDOE.CLIST(PDF44)'
        ------------------------      -----------------------------

        NONVSAM--JOHNDOE.EXEC
        ---------------------

    Notes: When a dsname is not properly extracted by BR, VI or ED, the
    user should retry with the WP command, correct the dsname, then
    enter the B, V or E action character. If the ISPF BROWSE service
    fails, *FASTPATH* invokes the BR command
    <http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/BR.html> if it is available.

    When a BR, ED, VI or WP command is entered for a specific data set,
    i.e. with the explicit dsname, referral list of point-and-shoot
    options explained above, *FASTPATH* issues RACROUTE to check the
    user's access to the data set. If the user does not have READ
    access, *FASTPATH* fails the command to prevent an S913-28 abend and
    issues a warning message.

 6. Migrated Data Sets

    When it detects that an action is performed against a migrated data
    set, *FASTPATH* prompts the user before the system RECALLs the data
    set. The user has the possibility to terminate the action or RECALL
    the data set and continue.

 7. Relative Generation data sets

    When it detects that a point-and-shoot action is performed against a
    dsname which contains a relative generation number such as
    AA.BB.CC(+1), *FASTPATH* changes the relative generation number to
    .G*V%% and invokes the Work-place instead of the requested function.
    This results in the ISPF Workplace panel being shown with the
    converted dsname as follows:

     Object Name . . . . 'AA.BB.CC.G*V%%'

    The user can then press ENTER to invoke the Data Set List utility to
    display the currently active generation associated to the specified
    generation data set.


      The CALendar Command

The CALendar command uses the CAL option of the ISPF V4 Status Area to
display a calendar in a pop-up window.


      The CONNECT Command

The CONNECT command invokes the WSCON function of *FASTPATH* to initiate
a connection with the ISPF Work-station Agent
<http://gsf-soft.com/Documents/ISPF-CS.html> (ISPF 4.2 and above).
CONNECT is a shortcut to the panel normally reached using the Settings
option. CONNECT has no operand. On ISPF 5.0 and above, the WSCON and
WSDISCON commands should be used instead of CONNECT.


      The CNTL Command

The CNTL command allows the user to EDIT the ISPF control data set
whether it's preallocated in the LOGON procedure to DDNAME(ISPCTLn) or
allocated by ISPF to DSNAME(userid.SPFTEMn.CNTL). CNTL edits the control
data set that corresponds to the logical screen in which the CNTL
command is entered, except if CNTL 0 is entered, in which case the
SUBMIT temporary data set (ISPCTL0) is edited.


      The CRASH, LOGON and LOGOFF commands

The CRASH command causes ISPF and any application executing under it to
terminate and control to return to the TMP. CRASH is useful when the
user wants to exit ISPF in a hurry without properly closing work in
progress such as EDIT sessions. For all intents and purposes, CRASH
causes ISPF to terminate as if the TSO session was cancelled by the
operator, except that the TSO session itself does not abend.

The user can specify a TSO command to be executed at the READY prompt
after the termination of ISPF. For example, entering CRASH PDF
terminates ISPF and re-enters it immediately. Similarly, entering CRASH
%MYCLIST or CRASH TSOLIB DEACT execute the corresponding command at the
READY prompt.

If the CRASH =pli command is entered, *FASTPATH* retrieves (and executes
at the READY prompt) the following TSO/E commands:

 p. the command specified in the PARM field of the TSO/E LOGON procedure
 l. the command specified in the command field of the TSO/E LOGON panel
 i. the command used to invoke ISPF (such as PDF, ISPF or ISPSTART).

Each command is executed in the order specified for its identifier (that
is, p, l or i) in the =pli string. For example, if CRASH =p is entered,
only the command specified in the LOGON proc's PARM is executed; if
CRASH =li is specified, both the command from the LOGON panel and the
command used to invoke ISPF are executed. If =pli is specified, all
three commands are executed.

If CRASH is entered without a command, control returns to the READY
prompt or, if ISPF was invoked from a CLIST, to the next CLIST
statement. Note that, unlike CLISTs, REXX EXECs do not survive CRASH:
any REXX EXEC started before ISPF (and still active at the time CRASH is
executed) is terminated.

The LOGON and LOGOFF fast-path commands are shortcuts to CRASH LOGON and
CRASH LOGOFF. For example, entering LOGOFF terminates ISPF and executes
the LOGOFF command. Entering LOGON JOHNDOE terminates ISPF and issues
the LOGON JOHNDOE command to re-logon.

If CRASH is issued while a CLIST or REXX EXEC is running within ISPF,
the recovery routine of the EXEC command writes abend messages to the
terminal. This is normal and can not be eliminated.


      The D2X Command

The D2X command uses the REXXTRY
<http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/REXXTRY.html> function to convert a
decimal value to hexadecimal. Example:

 D2X  12345+23


      The FSPASTE Command

The FSPASTE command displays a completely blank input screen that allows
pasting of text that is wider and higher than the ISPF editor input
area. Once the data is pasted (using the paste facility of the 3270
emulator), it is presented to the user in a dedicated VIEW session, from
which it can be processed with EDIT command or macros (such as CREATE,
CUT or ROUTE <http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/ROUTE.html>). FSPASTE
requires the presence of the STEMEDIT
<http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/STEMEDIT.html> utility program.

The maximum number of lines that can be pasted is the number of
horizontal lines of the 3270-type terminal; for example, a 3270-5
standard terminal, the maximum number of lines is 27. If too many lines
are pasted, then additional lines overlay the top lines - it's a mess !
Sorry !


      The FSTso Command

The FSTso (TSO Full-Screen) command executes the TSO command passed as a
parameter, captures the output using OUTTRAP and displays the result
using BRIF (the ISPF BRowse InterFace). FSTso requires the presence of
the STEMDISP or STEMEDIT <http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/STEMEDIT.html>
utility programs. When STEMEDIT
<http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/STEMEDIT.html> is used, the user can
switch from BROWSE to VIEW by entering the *V* command, then use
commands such as CREATE, CUT or ROUTE
<http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/ROUTE.html> to transfer the data to a
permanent location.

To display the HELP text for the LISTCAT command, enter:

    FSTso H LISTCAT

To retrieve the data set name at the cursor location, use the %DSNAME
string, as shown in this example:

    FSTso LISTCAT ENT('%DSNAME')

FSTso uses the standard TSO/E OUTTRAP facility and, consequently, only
supports applications that use PUTLINE to write to the TSO terminal.
Programs that use TPUT or BSAM/QSAM to write to the TSO terminal do not
work with FSTso


      The ICS Command

The ICS command invokes the ISPF Command Shell (PDF option 6).


      The IND$FILE Command

The IND$FILE command allows 3270-type file transfer on any ISPF screen.
This works with IBM's PC/3270 (aka PCOM) and Passport emulators, as well
as with some (but not all) non-IBM emulators.


      The LC command

The LC command uses the FSTSO
<http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/FASTPATH.html#fstso> function to provide a
point-and-shoot, full-screen LISTCAT facility. LC extracts the dsname
under the cursor, invokes the LISTCAT command and presents the result in
a BROWSE window.


      The LISTBc command

The LISTBc command invokes the TSO LISTBC command with MODE(FSCR) to
ensure displayed messages are displayed at the top of the screen.


      The LOAD and UNLOAD commands

The LOAD command loads a RENT or REUS program in the address space for
the duration of the ISPF session or, if ISPF has been invoked via a REXX
EXEC, until the EXEC terminates. UNLOAD deletes a module that is
currently loaded in memory. Caution should be exercised when using the
UNLOAD command, as deletion of an in-use module may cause abends.

Notes:

  * The LOAD command supports LIBDEF ISPLLIB
  * The UNLOAD command cancels timers when the exit address is contained
    in the UNLOADed module


      The MACLib Command

The MACLIB command displays a macro in the SYS1.MACLIB and SYS1.MODGEN
concatenation using BROWSE in ISPF/PDF V3 or VIEW in ISPF V4. To display
all the TSO macros, enter:

 MAClib IKJ*

If *FASTPATH* finds a PVTMACS library on the system, it concatenates it
to MACLIB and MODGEN. *FASTPATH* looks for the following names:

 SYS1.PVTMACS, &ZUSER..PVTMACS, &ZUSER..PVTMACS.MACLIB


      The NETSTAT Command

The NETSTAT command invokes the TCP/IP NETSTAT command and displays the
result using BRIF. This function requires the presence of the STEMDISP
or STEMEDIT <http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/STEMEDIT.html> utility
programs.

The NETSTAT command accepts the same parameters as the TCP/IP NETSTAT
command, except STACK and REPORT. For example:

 NETSTAT DEVLINK

Note: Specifying NETSTAT without any parameter is equivalent to NETSTAT
CONN.


      The PARMLib Command

The PARMLib command EDITs members in SYS1.PARMLIB or in the PARMLIB
concatenation (OS/390 R2 or above). If the user doesn't have UPDATE
authority to SYS1.PARMLIB, then VIEW is used instead of EDIT. Example:

 PARML IEASYS*


      The REXXTry Command

The REXXTry command executes a line of REXX code passed as an argument.
For example:

 REXXTRY SAY 256*3

REXX and ISPF both use the semi-colon to separate statements and
commands. Before REXXTRY <http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/REXXTRY.html> is
invoked to execute a the line of code that contains multiple statements
separated by a semi-colon, the ZDEL command should be issued to change
the ISPF command delimiter to another character. For example:

    ZDEL :
    REXXT x='abcdef'; SAY x
    ZDEL ;


      The SDsf Command

The SDdf command starts SDSF. An SDSF option can be specified in the
command. For example:

    SD H ABC*


      The SYSID Command

The SYSID command displays the system ID (SMFSID) and ISPF logical
screen number in the upper left-hand corner of the screen (ISPF 4.2 or
above). The display is permanent and only affects the current logical
screen. Entering SYSID OFF or SCRNAME OFF turns the display off.

This command can not be entered on an SDSF screen because SDSF has a
SYSID command of its own. However, SYSID can be issued on the ISPF
primary options menu before SDSF is started. To enter the command while
already in SDSF, proceed as follows:

 1. stack any non-SDSF panel on top of SDSF (e.g. enter BR)
 2. issue SYSID
 3. issue the END or RETURN command to go back to the SDSF screen


      The TIME Command

The TIME command displays the date and time in the upper right-hand
corner of the screen. Pressing the HELP key right after entering the
TIME command displays the day of the week and the julian date. Example:

EDIT     GILBERT.FILE183.PDS                         2009-12-14 19:50:45
Command ===>                                            Scroll ===> CSR
Monday 14 Dec 2009  2009.348  19:50:45  Timezone: E.00.59.16


      The TSOCmd Command

The TSOCmd (TSO Command) command executes the TSO command passed as a
parameter. To retrieve the data set name at the cursor location, use the
%DSNAME string, as shown in this example:

    TSOCmd LINKMAP '%DSNAME'


      The UTil Command

The UTil command invokes the Utility Selection Panel (PDF option 3). A
sub-option can be specified in the command. For example, to invoke the
Data Set Utility (PDF option 3.4), enter:

    UTil 4


      The VERASE Command

The VERASE command removes a variable from the shared and/or the profile
pool. To delete the EDBR0023 variable from the ISPF profile, enter:

    VERASE EDBR0023


      The X2D Command

The X2D command uses the REXXTRY
<http://gsf-soft.com/Freeware/REXXTRY.html> function to convert a
hexadecimal value to decimal. Example:

    D2X  3E8


      The ZDEL Command

The ZDEL command displays or sets the ZDEL variable, which specifies the
character used to chain ISPF commands (the default value is ";"). When
entered without an operand, ZDEL displays the current value of the ZDEL
variable (i.e. the current command delimiter). A new delimiter can be
entered in the command; for example, to change the current delimiter to
the back-slash, enter:

    ZDEL \

The ZDEL function uses an undocumented interface to update the ZDEL
variable. This has been tested in ISPF versions from 3.5 through 5.5 but
may produce unexpected results in future releases of ISPF.


      The B, D, E and V functions

These functions do not correspond to any fastpath command but are
available when access to the BROWSE, LMMDEL, EDIT or VIEW services is
needed in an ISPF Dialog Manager panel.


      The EXECPGM function

This function speeds up the execution of a program from the link-list.


      The FTINCL function

This function performs a simple File Tailoring sequence which can be
invoked from an ISPF panel. The format of the PARM is as follows:

 PARM='FTINCL,&skel,&panel,&applid'

The FTINCL functions invokes the following ISPF services:

 DISPLAY PANEL(&panel) (optional)
 FTOPEN TEMP
 FTINCL &skel
 FTCLOSE
 EDIT DATASET(&ZTEMPF)


      The SELECT function

This function allows *FASTPATH* to be automatically invoked when ISPF
starts to perform initialisation tasks such as ADDCMDS and PRELOAD. When
*FASTPATH* is finished initialising, it starts the main ISPF service,
typically a primary option menu such as ISP@MSTR or ISR@PRIM. The main
ISPF service is specified in the SELECT parm as shown in this example:

 ISPF PGM(FASTPATH) PARM(SELECT PANEL(APRIOPT) NEWAPPL(MVS))

Note that *FASTPATH* normally requires that a comma be used to separate
the name of the function from its parameters; in the case of SELECT, a
space may be used as shown in the preceding example.

If PARM is omitted or simply specified as PARM(SELECT), *FASTPATH*
starts PANEL(ISR@PRIM) NEWAPPL(ISR) as the main service.

    Customizing FASTPATH

1. Tables

*FASTPATH* contains two tables that can be easily modified.

a. the ISPCMDS table, which contains the entries that *FASTPATH* adds to
the ISPCMDS at the beginning of an ISPF session. This table can be found
at the very end of the *FASTPATH* source .

b. the PRELOAD table, which contains the name of the programs that
*FASTPATH* pre-loads to enhance performance.

2. RESET

The RESET EDIT macro may prevent you from accessing a real program also
called "RESET". In that case, you may comment out the IDENTIFY macro
that defines RESET.


    FASTPATH Q&A

Q. What is the environment required to run *FASTPATH*?

A. Fastpath runs on MVS/ESA V4R3, MVS/ESA V5, OS/390 and z/OS.

Q. My installation does not allow "command stacking" in ISPF, they claim
it "uses too many resources".

A. This is probably incorrect. Command stacking uses less resources than
any of its alternatives, particularly when a user constantly switches
between functions using jump commands (such as =3.4).

Q. We have already modified ISPCMDS and defined ED and BR as fast-path
commands to invoke EDIT and BROWSE directly. We plan to use SITECMDS in
ISPF V4.2.

A. *FASTPATH* offers additional capabilities: tags, cursor-driven
capabilities, and APPLid consistency. You can get the best of both
worlds by modifying ISPCMDS to invoke *FASTPATH* built-in functions
instead of calling directly EDIT and BROWSE.

Q. We run ISPF 3.5 and have installed fast-path commands in ISRCMDS
because we didn't want to modify ISPCMDS.

A. In that case, fast-path commands can only be used when you're in PDF;
for example, they won't work in SDSF.

Q. We use ISPF V4 which has the action bar and Reference Lists. Do we
still need *FASTPATH* commands?

A. The action bar is only available when you are in ISPF and it requires
more key-strokes than *FASTPATH*. Reference lists also require
key-strokes and scrolling. They offer no equivalent to the cursor-driven
capabilities of *FASTPATH* commands .

Q. Our systems Programmer is a 3.4 maniac who doesn't want to customize
ISPF so we can use fast-path commands. What can we do?

A. You can use *FASTPATH* just for yourself without having to make
modifications to the ISPF environment. Link it into a private
load-library and call it once at the beginning of an ISPF session: as
long as you stay in ISPF, fast-path commands are available to you.

Q. I used fast-path commands before but they were not always working
properly: when stacking BROWSE on top of SDSF, for example, the FIND key
wouldn't work right.

A. This is an APPLid problem caused by an improper set-up. *FASTPATH*
makes sure every function is invoked with the right APPLid to ensure
predictable and constant behaviour.

Q. When using *FASTPATH*'s cursor-driven capabilities, we noticed that
the dsname is not always extracted correctly.

A. The dsname extraction algorithm in *FASTPATH* has been rewritten in
release 129 and will be further improved in the future. Dsname
extraction only works if the dsname is fully visible on the screen, and
not in a message line or message window.

Q. How can I automatically set *FASTPATH* commands up without having to
type TSO FASTPATH each time I start ISPF?

A. You can specify *FASTPATH* in the ISPF start command, for example:

 ISPF PGM(FASTPATH) PARM(SELECT PANEL(APRIOPT) NEWAPPL(MVS))

Last Update: July 2012 for the release 149 of *FASTPATH*.
