//***FILE 614 is from Sam Golob and contains load module libraries  *   FILE 614
//*           for various versions of the SHOWMVS and SHOWZOS       *   FILE 614
//*           programs from File 492.  Roland Schiradin requested   *   FILE 614
//*           that I not include load module libraries in File      *   FILE 614
//*           492 itself, because of the various versions of z/OS   *   FILE 614
//*           products such as ISPF and LE and TCP/IP which may     *   FILE 614
//*           be included in the final load module and which may    *   FILE 614
//*           cause some problem in some systems, if they are the   *   FILE 614
//*           wrong version for that system.  So it is best for     *   FILE 614
//*           each installation to assemble and linkedit SHOWMVS    *   FILE 614
//*           or SHOWZOS for itself.                                *   FILE 614
//*                                                                 *   FILE 614
//*           However, it is difficult for some shops to assemble   *   FILE 614
//*           SHOWMVS and SHOWZOS, because they don't have the      *   FILE 614
//*           proper version of the High Level Assembler (ASMA90)   *   FILE 614
//*           or they are missing some of the other requirements    *   FILE 614
//*           for properly creating a SHOWMVS or SHOWZOS load       *   FILE 614
//*           module.  Therefore, I have created this file so       *   FILE 614
//*           that such shops can have a quick install of SHOWMVS   *   FILE 614
//*           or SHOWZOS, to suit (at least) most of their needs.   *   FILE 614
//*                                                                 *   FILE 614

//*       To create a load library from one of these members,       *   FILE 614
//*       use the RECEIVE command under TSO:                        *   FILE 614
//*                                                                 *   FILE 614
//*       RECEIVE INDS(hlq.FILE614.pds(memname))                    *   FILE 614
//*                                                                 *   FILE 614
//*       and answer the prompts for DSN( ), VOL( ), UNIT( ) etc.   *   FILE 614
//*       or just press ENTER.                                      *   FILE 614
//*                                                                 *   FILE 614
//*  Note:  SHOWzOS 7.17 and 7.18 assemble differently on z/OS 1.8  *   FILE 614
//*         systems and on z/OS 1.9 systems.  The z/OS 1.9 assembly *   FILE 614
//*         load module will work on 1.8, but the z/OS 1.8 load     *   FILE 614
//*         module will get an abend when run on z/OS 1.9 or 1.10.  *   FILE 614
//*         Similar results occur for SHOWzOS 7.19, and I suppose,  *   FILE 614
//*         for 7.20.                                               *   FILE 614
//*                                                                 *   FILE 614
//*         Therefore if you have multiple systems, it is           *   FILE 614
//*         recommended that you assemble SHOWzOS on z/OS 1.9 or    *   FILE 614
//*         higher.  Members marked SHO9xxxx were assembled at      *   FILE 614
//*         the z/OS 1.9 level.  Members marked SHOAxxxx were       *   FILE 614
//*         assembled on a z/OS 1.10 system.  Members marked        *   FILE 614
//*         SHOBxxxx were assembled on a z/OS 1.11 system.          *   FILE 614
//*         Similarly, SHOCxxxx on 1.12, and SHODxxxx on 1.13,      *   FILE 614
//*         and SHOExxxx on 2.1, and SHOGxxxx on 2.2.               *   FILE 614
