//***FILE 347 IS THE MODLIST PROGRAM FROM RICK FOCHTMAN OF          *   FILE 347
//*           CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.  THIS PROGRAM LOOKS AT A LOAD      *   FILE 347
//*           LIBRARY, AND TELLS YOU WHICH COMPILE-LINKEDIT         *   FILE 347
//*           OPTIONS ANY COBOL MODULES WERE CREATED WITH.          *   FILE 347
//*                                                                 *   FILE 347

//*     Note:  This program needs fixing.  For now, try using       *   FILE 347
//*            COBANAL from CBT File 321.   (S.G)                   *   FILE 347

//*     THE MODLIST PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED AS A STOP-GAP MEASURE,    *   FILE 347
//*     TO TRY AND KEEP A HANDLE ON OUR OS/VS COBOL TO COBOL II     *   FILE 347
//*     CONVERSION PROJECT.  THE ONLY KNOWN BUG LEFT IS IN          *   FILE 347
//*     DEALING WITH MODULES THAT MAY LOAD ABOVE THE 16M LINE.      *   FILE 347
//*     SOMETIMES THEY WORK OK; SOMETIMES NOT.                      *   FILE 347
//*                                                                 *   FILE 347
//*     THE OUTPUT FOR EACH LMOD STARTS WITH A LINE OF HYPHENS.     *   FILE 347
//*     THE FIRST LINE BELOW THAT DETAILS THE LMOD INFO,            *   FILE 347
//*     INCLUDING SOME LKED ATTRIBUTES.  BELOW THAT ARE LINES       *   FILE 347
//*     FOR EACH CSECT IN THE LMOD, MARKED BY CS-(NAME) FOR         *   FILE 347
//*     EACH CSECT.  WHERE POSSIBLE, COBOL COMPILER OPTIONS         *   FILE 347
//*     THAT WERE IN EFFECT FOR THE CSECT ARE DETAILED.  THE        *   FILE 347
//*     VARIOUS COMPILERS THAT ARE NOW RECOGNIZED ARE ANS4,         *   FILE 347
//*     OS/VS (LISTED AS VSR1) AND COBOL II (LISTED AS C2)          *   FILE 347

//*     THE PAN STAMP IS AN IN-HOUSE REQUIREMENT, SO THAT WE        *   FILE 347
//*     CAN MATCH SOURCE WITH LMOD CODE.  SINCE SOMEONE ELSE        *   FILE 347
//*     MIGHT BE USING THE SAME MECHANISM, I'VE LEFT THAT CODE      *   FILE 347
//*     INTACT.                                                     *   FILE 347

//*     THIS IS A REPORT PROGRAM ONLY AND THEREFORE NEEDS ONLY      *   FILE 347
//*     READ ACCESS TO ANY LOADLIB IT PROCESSES.                    *   FILE 347
