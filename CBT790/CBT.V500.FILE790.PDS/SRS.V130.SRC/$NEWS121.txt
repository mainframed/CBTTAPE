SYSOUT Retrieval Services (SRS) 1.2.1          Release Date: 07/15/2005

Enhancements in this release:

1. Keyword Expansion
   Most keywords have been expanded to enhance readability and simplify
   ease of use.  For example, 'J=' (the keyword to select jobname) can
   now be specified as 'JOBNAME=' 'JOBNAM=' 'JOBNA=' 'JOBN=' 'JOB='
   'JO=' or 'J='.  ** PLEASE SEE NOTE BELOW **

2. Separator records can now optionally be produced between each
   dataset, output group, or job.  The new SEP and SEPID keywords
   control whether separator records are produced and specify the
   text string used as a separator record prefix.

3. Installations can override any SRS defaults by updating the
   SRSOPTS module shipped with the product.  (For example, the
   default FORMS specification can be changed from 'STD' to 'STDX').
   In addition, a "prepackaged" set of options can be generated for
   specific uses and jobs can reference these options with the new
   OPT= keyword.  The $OPTIONS member in the source library can be
   used to update the system-wide SRSOPTS default options or to
   generate a unique options set.

4. Product packaging has been streamlined to make module re-assembly
   easier.  See member $ASMSRS in the source library.

5. Miscellaneous:
   - SRSDRVR is now RMODE ANY.
   - Better syntax checking for parms specified.
   - Minor improvements to messages issued.
   - LIMIT maximum increased from 999 to 9999.

NOTE: There is one incompatible change in this release.  Due to the
      keyword processing changes, parameters on the PPARM= keyword
      must now be enclosed in parentheses.  For example,
      PPARM=OUTFILE=SRSOUT was valid in SRS 1.2.0 but now must be
      specified as: PPARM=(OUTFILE=SRSOUT)
