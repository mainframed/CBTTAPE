   A¢PDS+subcommand may be entered to the left of a member name as a
   line command.  In addition, up to eight additional operand bytes may
   be entered to the right of a member name.

   Normal¢PDS+rules for subcommand name abbreviations apply and you will
   have to use more than one character for some line command names.  For
   example, the subcommand TSOLIST can be abbreviated as TSOL and not as
   T, TS or TSO since there is a¢PDS+subcommand called TSO.
