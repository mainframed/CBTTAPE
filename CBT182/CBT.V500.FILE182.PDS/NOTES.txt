0    PDS was originally written in 1972 at Fireman's Fund Insurance.

     Since the PDS command was written, it has grown in size and
     complexity:
        A.  Number of subcommands (was 12, now 46)
        B.  Number of source statements (was 4050, now 28500)
        C.  Number of HELP statements (was 500, now 5120)
        D.  Size of load module (was 16K, now 132K)
- Purpose
+ _______
0    The PDS command was designed to manipulate PDS's or partitioned
     data sets.  In the past, only non-authorized functions have been
     performed by the PDS command.

     Sequential data sets are also allowed for several of the PDS
     subcommands which process target data sets.  The documented syntax
     is changed in that no data is entered for the member name position.

     Thus, a LIST subcommand such as LIST MEMBERXX SKIPREC(20) for a
     partitioned data set would be entered as LIST SKIPREC(20) for a
     sequential data set.
- Subcommand name abbreviation:
+ _____________________________
  Subcommand names may be abbreviated to the first few characters of the
  subcommand name.  Subcommand names are scanned in the order of the
  output from the OPTIONS subcommand or from an invalid subcommand
  message and the first name match is used.  For example if the invalid
  subcommand, NN, is entered, the following system response would be
  received:

   PDS771E NN IS AN INVALID SUBCOMMAND; ENTER "HELP" OR "OPTIONS" FOR HELP
   SUBCOMMANDS: ATTRIB   ALIAS    BROWSE   CHANGE   COMPARE  COMPRESS CONTROL
                COPY     DISPLAY  DIRENTRY DELETE   DSNAME   DSPRINT  EDIT
                END      EXEC     FIND     FIXPDS   FSE      HELP     HISTORY
                IF       ISPF     ISPMODE  LIST     MAP      MEMBERS  MEMLIST
                OPTIONS  OUTCOPY  PATTERN  PRINTOFF RECALL   RENAME   REPLACE
                REPRO    RESTORE  REVIEW   SUBMIT   SUBLIST  TSO      TSOEDIT
                TSOLIST  USAGE    VERIFY   VPSPRINT

  If the subcommand name A is entered, the ATTRIB subcommand will be
  given control; likewise, if AL is entered, the ALIAS subcommand
  will be given control.

0 Keyword abbreviation:
+ _____________________
  Subcommand keywords may be abbreviated to the first characters
  which make the keyword unique.  For example, HELP LIST SYNTAX
  returns:
     SYNTAX -
          LIST  member NUM/SNUM/NONUM/LBLOCK/LDUMP/BLOCK/DUMP
                       OFFSET(Hx) MODULE(Partm)
                       SKIPREC(n) MAXIN(n) MAXOUT(n)
                       SKIPCOL(n) MAXLEN(n)

  The keyword LDUMP may be abbreviated to LD, LDU or LDUM; the keyword
  OFFSET may be abbreviated as the letter O or any other substring of
  the keyword; and SKIPCOL(42) may be abbreviated as SKIPC(42).

+ _____________
0 Several subcommands allow for specification of a member name group which
  consists of a member name range or member name pattern as follows:

0    Member name range -- a subcommand may process all members in a
+    _________________
     range of members by specifying a beginning partial member
     name, a colon, and an ending partial member name (where either
     or both of the partial names may be null):
        subcommand  :         (all members of the data set)
        subcommand  pt1:      (members from PT1 to the end of the directory)
        subcommand  :pt2      (members from X'00' through PT299999)
        subcommand  pt3:pt4   (members from PT3 through PT499999)

0    Member name pattern -- a subcommand may process all members whose
+    ___________________
     names contain pattern character segments by specifying a member
     name segment, a slash, and another member name segment (either,
     but not both, of the member name segments may be null):
        subcommand  sg1/      (all member names containing SG1)
        subcommand  /sg2      (all member names containing SG2)
        subcommand  sg3/sg4   (all member names containing SG3 and SG4)

0    Member lists -- a subcommand may process those members whose names
+    ____________
     or group names appear in a list of member names:
        subcommand  (aa,bb)   (members AA and BB)
        subcommand  (:bb,cc)  (members from X'00' through BB999999 and CC)
        subcommand  (aa,/dd)  (member AA and all members containing DD)

0    Default member name -- if no member name is specified, the last
+    ___________________
     member name list, member name or member group entered for any
     subcommand which defines member groups will be assumed.

0    Asterisk member name -- if * is entered in the member name position,
+    ____________________
     the last member name list, member name or member group entered for
     any subcommand which defines member groups will be assumed.

- Member Protection
+ _________________
0 To ensure that members are not modified which might be in use
  elsewhere in an installation, PDS subcommands which modify members
  issue ISPF style enqueue checks before accessing a member.
- Data Set Protection
+ ___________________
0 In addition, several PDS subcommands could cause data set integrity
  problems if they changed a data set when it was being updated by
  another user.

  To circumvent this problem for SHR allocations, PDS uses
  ISPF reserve logic to maintain data set integrity during data set
  updates.
1 Background execution                                                   PAGE- 3
+ ____________________
0 Since PDS uses PUTLINE, PUTGET and GETLINE MACRO's for terminal
  communication, PDS may be used effectively in background mode for
  processing large data sets as in the following example JOB:

  //JOBNAME  JOB  ...
  //A       EXEC  PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=30
  //SYSTSPRT  DD  SYSOUT=*
  //SYSTSIN   DD  *
   PDS  'SYS1.SMPCDS'
   FIXPDS EXPANDDIR(100)
   VERIFY :
   CHANGE  'SYS1.LINKLIB'
   IF A:Z RMODEANY THEN(MAP)
   END
  //

  When PDS is used in background mode, no prompting for yes or no
  replies is performed; instead, at each decision point, a yes response
  is assumed.
