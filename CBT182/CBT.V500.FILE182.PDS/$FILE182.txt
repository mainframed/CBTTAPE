//*           The PDS command allows the TSO user to access and     *   FILE 182
//*           manipulate the directory and selected members of a    *   FILE 182
//*           partitioned data set.  The PDS command contains       *   FILE 182
//*           hundreds of separate functions, and can be operated   *   FILE 182
//*           either in TSO Line Mode (with PUTLINE interfacing)    *   FILE 182
//*           or in ISPF Fullscreen mode.  ISPF mode has all of     *   FILE 182
//*           the line mode functions, and also, many additional    *   FILE 182
//*           capabilities.  PDS, in Line Mode, can be run from     *   FILE 182
//*           a system console under TSSO (from File 404).  TSSO    *   FILE 182
//*           is a subsystem, which can be brought up under         *   FILE 182
//*           SUB=MSTR without JES.  In that case, the Line Mode    *   FILE 182
//*           functions of PDS still work.  Therefore, you can      *   FILE 182
//*           expand the directory of a pds, copy members from      *   FILE 182
//*           one pds to another, etc etc, without JES2 or JES3     *   FILE 182
//*           and without TSO being up.  This makes for a great     *   FILE 182
//*           recovery tool.  Please explore this while your        *   FILE 182
//*           system is healthy, and have the mechanisms in place,  *   FILE 182
//*           just in case.                                         *   FILE 182

//*           With its directory options, the PDS command can       *   FILE 182

//*           display portions of the directory, and scratch,       *   FILE 182
//*           rename or create aliases for selected members.  For   *   FILE 182
//*           all of a pds's members that have previously been      *   FILE 182
//*           deleted and before the library has been compressed    *   FILE 182
//*           PDS will allow you to go in and restore those         *   FILE 182
//*           members.  For load data sets, options are available   *   FILE 182
//*           to list load module history data, display and         *   FILE 182
//*           modify load module linkage attributes, and produce    *   FILE 182
//*           load module CSECT maps in two different lengths.      *   FILE 182
//*           For other partitioned data sets, options are          *   FILE 182
