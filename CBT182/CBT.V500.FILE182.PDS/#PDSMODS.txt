****VER 2.0: ADDED FORMATTING OPTIONS FOR LIST;                    ****
*            ADDED EDIT, FIND AND SUBMIT SUBCOMMANDS.                 *
*                                                                     *
****VER 2.2: CORRECTED AN ERROR IN LIST AND FIND FOR DATA SETS     ****

*                                                                     *
****VER 2.3: MADE SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS AS SUGGESTED BY DINESH      ****
*       DATTANI FROM PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE CO. OF AMERICA, TORONTO     *
*       1.  OUTPUT THE PROGRAM OPTION LIST IN SORTED ORDER.           *
*       2.  ADDED SEVERAL EDIT DESCRIPTIVE QUALIFIERS.                *
*                                                                     *
****VER 3.0: UPDATED THE PDS COMMAND FOR MVS USE BASED ON A        ****
*       VERSION OF THE PDS COMMAND ON THE CBT MODS TAPE.              *
*       1.  ADDED EXEC (EXPLICIT AND IMPLIED) AND HELP SUBCOMMANDS.   *
*       2.  A SINGLE CHARACTER SUBCOMMAND NAME IS NOT AMBIGUOUS.      *
*       3.  SUPPORT WAS ADDED IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS:                 *
*           -- SSI INFORMATION DISPLAY                                *
*           -- APF DATA CAN BE LISTED AND MODIFIED                    *
*           -- HEXADECIMAL MEMBER NAMES ALLOWED AS INPUT              *
*           -- HEXADECIMAL OUTPUT ADDED - DISPLAY, PATTERN, MEMBERS   *
*           -- M$PUTGT, M$PUTLIN AND MESSAGE MACROS WERE ADDED        *
*           -- ATTRIB LISTS ALL ALIASES FOR A GIVEN MODULE            *
*       4.  SEVERAL SOURCES OF 0C7'S WERE CORRECTED FOR IDR DATA.     *
*       5.  THE MEMBER NAME VALIDITY CHECK ROUTINE HAD TWO BUGS:      *
*           --  THE MEMBER NAME LENGTH USED WAS THE INPUT NAME        *
*               LENGTH (INCORRECT FOR HEXADECIMAL NAMES)              *
*           --  PROMPTING FOR INVALID MEMBER NAMES WAS INCORRECT      *
*       6.  THE ATTRIB SUBCOMMAND SOMETIMES LISTED SSI INFORMATION    *
*           FOR NON-LOAD MODULES WHICH DID NOT HAVE ANY SSI DATA.     *
*                                                                     *
****VER 3.1: SEVERAL GENERAL CHANGES WERE MADE                     ****
*       1.  THE PATTERN SUBCOMMAND WAS ADDED.                         *
*       2.  DEFAULT MEMBER NAMES ARE ALLOWED FOR ATTRIB, BROWSE,      *
*           DELETE, DIRENTRY, DSPRINT, EDIT, FSE, FIND, HISTORY, IF,  *
*           LIST, MAP, MEMBERS, OUTCOPY, PRINTOFF, REVIEW, SPFEDIT,   *
*           SUBMIT AND TSOLIST SUBCOMMANDS.                           *
*       3.  PDS WAS ADDED AS AN ALIAS FOR THE CHANGE SUBCOMMAND.      *
*       4.  ALIAS SUBCOMMAND IS NOT PREVENTED FROM WORKING IF THE     *
*           APF DATA LENGTH IS INVALID (APF=0 IS USED).               *
*       5.  EDIT PREVIOUSLY USED THE PREVIOUS PDL FOR DEFAULT         *
*           MEMBERS; NOW THE EDIT WORK AREA IS SAVED BEFORE EACH      *
*           SUBCOMMAND SCAN.                                          *
*                                                                     *
****VER 4.0: MADE SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS AS SUGGESTED BY SEYMOUR     ****
*        METZ FROM COMNET IN WASHINGTON, D.C.:                        *
*        1.  REPLACED IBM/360 INSTRUCTIONS WITH THEIR IBM/370         *
*            EQUIVALENTS (ICM, STCM, MVCL, ...)                       *
*        2.  REPLACED BCR INSTRUCTIONS WITH EQUIVALENT MNEMONICS.     *
*        3.  TSO SERVICE ROUTINE ADDRESSES ARE NOW OBTAINED FROM      *
*            THE CVT INSTEAD OF VIA LOAD/DELETE CODE.                 *
*                                                                     *
****VER 4.1: SEVERAL ADDITIONAL CHANGES WERE MADE TO TAKE          ****
*        ADVANTAGE OF MVS PROGRAM LOGIC AND SERVICE ROUTINES:         *
*        1.  USED THE DAIRFAIL MESSAGE ROUTINE INSTEAD OF INTERNALLY  *
*            GENERATING MESSAGES AS SUGGESTED BY SEYMOUR METZ.        *
*        2.  USED THE GENERAL FAIL MESSAGE ROUTINE FOR PARSE ERRORS.  *
*        3.  USED THE TSO DEFAULT ROUTINE TO FULLY QUALIFY DSNAMES.   *
*        4.  CHANGED THE ALLOCATION STRATEGY TO "PERMANENTLY"         *
*            ALLOCATE DATA SETS SO THAT EXTERNAL PDS SUBCOMMANDS      *
*            CAN USE AN UNCATALOGED DATA SET AFTER IT IS ALLOCATED    *
*            BY PDS.  THIS CHANGE WAS SUGGESTED BY JOE RAREY          *
*            WITH MARTIN-MARRIETA IN FLORIDA.                         *

****VER 4.2: AFTER THE DAIRFAIL CHANGES INDICATED ABOVE, THE       ****
*            VOLUME PARAMETER FOR UNCATALOGED DATA SETS DID NOT WORK. *

*                                                                     *

*                                                                     *
*            PRINTOFF: A SUBCOMMAND TO LINK TO THE PRINTOFF COMMAND   *
*            AS SUGGESTED BY DAVID FILSINGER OF FACSO (SHARE CODE CB) *

*                                                                     *

****VER 5.1:  MADE SOME CODE CLEANUP CHANGES;                      ****
*                                                                     *

*                                                                     *
*        EXCP'S ARE NOW ALL IN AN EXCP SUBROUTINE; SET AND READ       *
*        SECTORS ARE PERFORMED FOR ALL DISK DRIVES EXCEPT 2314'S.     *

*        AN OBTAIN IS ALWAYS PERFORMED ONCE FOR EACH INPUT DATA       *
*        SET (NOT WHEN NEEDED AS BEFORE IN RESTORE AND USAGE).        *
*                                                                     *
*        PDS BLDL'S ARE PERFORMED BEFORE INVOKING THE PROCESSING      *
*        SUBROUTINE.  IN ADDITION, PDS MAINTAINS THE STATUS OF THE    *

*        ADDED A RESTORE SUBCOMMAND TEST FACILITY:  AN EXISTING       *
*        MEMBER MAY BE "RESTORED" IF THE RESTORE MEMBER NAME BEGINS   *
*        WITH "TEMP".  USE THE DIRENTRY SUBCOMMAND TO COMPARE THEIR   *
*        DIRECTORY ENTRIES (REMEMBER TO DELETE THE TEMP MEMBER SINCE  *
*        YOU HAVE AN APPARENT ALIAS -- NEITHER HAS AN ALIAS BIT SET). *
*                                                                     *

*        CHANGE AND PDS: IF A VOLUME NAME IS SUPPLIED, SYSALLDA IS    *
*        USED AS THE UNIT NAME; OTHERWISE, THE UNIT NAME FROM THE     *
*        PSCB WOULD BE USED (WHICH MIGHT NOT COVER THE VOLUME TO BE   *
*        ALLOCATED).  REPORTED BY BILL COWAN WITH THE COCA-COLA       *

*        ATTENTION HANDLING IMPROVEMENTS -- TWO ATTENTIONS IN A ROW   *
*        ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO TERMINATE PDS; ALL SUBCOMMANDS     *
*        NOW RECOGNIZE ATTENTION INTERRUPTS TO SOME DEGREE:           *
*        A.  PDS ATTENTION HANDLING IS NOW DOCUMENTED IN PDS'S HELP   *
*            (ENTER "HELP ATTN" FOR MORE INFORMATION).                *
*        B.  FIXED A BUG: A NULL RESPONSE TO "ENTER OPTION" AFTER     *
*            AN ATTENTION DID NOT ALLOW THE SUBCOMMAND TO CONTINUE.   *
*        C.  THE INPUT ROUTINE NOW ALSO CHECKS FOR ATTENTION -- THIS  *
*            ELIMINATES WAITING UNTIL A MESSAGE IS OUTPUT AS BEFORE.  *
*                                                                     *

****VER 5.3:  CHANGED THE CSECT STRUCTURE OF PDS AND MADE THE      ****
*        FOLLOWING OTHER CHANGES:                                     *
*                                                                     *
*        EDIT AND BROWSE:                                             *
*        A.  THE INITIALIZATION ADDRESS FOR PDS PASSED TO ISPF IS     *
*            NOW CONVERTED TO DECIMAL BEFORE THE CALL AND CONVERTED   *
*            BACK TO BINARY ON THE RECURSIVE ENTRY IN PDS DUE TO THE  *
*            POTENTIAL PROBLEM OF A X'5D' (A RIGHT PARENTHESIS) IN    *
*            THE ADDRESS.  THIS WAS REPORTED BY SEYMOUR METZ, U.S.    *
*            DEPARTMENT OF STATE.                                     *
*        B.  A PARAMETER LIST PASSED TO INITIALIZE SPF OR ISPF MUST   *
*            NOT BE REUSED BY THE CALLING PROGRAM SINCE SPF USES IT   *
*            LATER IF IT SPLITS THE USER'S SCREEN.  THIS PROBLEM WAS  *
*            RESOLVED BY MIKE LOOS WITH DELUXE CHECK PRINTERS.        *
*        BROWSE: THE ALLOCATED FILE IS NOW FREED BEFORE EACH CALL     *
*        TO SPF SINCE THE DATA SET COULD BE UPDATED IN A SUBSEQUENT   *
*        SPLIT SCREEN.                                                *
*                                                                     *
*        EDIT AND TSOEDIT: ADDED NEW AND OLD KEYWORDS TO ALLOW BLDL   *
*        CHECKING OF MEMBER NAMES BEFORE ENTERING EITHER EDITOR.      *
*                                                                     *
*        END: THE RETURN CODE ASSIGNED BY THE PROGRAM IS NOW SAVED    *
*        TEMPORARILY IN THE PROGRAM'S STORAGE; IN VERSION 5.2 THE     *
*        RETURN CODE IS CHANGED DURING A CALL TO FREE THE FILE AND    *
*        A STACK DELETE IS INCORRECTLY ISSUED AT PDS TERMINATION.     *
*                                                                     *

*        MAP: DELETED THE SMAP SUBCOMMAND AND MADE SEVERAL CHANGES -  *
*           1.  ADDED FULL, SHORT AND ENTRY KEYWORDS                  *
*           2.  ADDED MODULE NAME FILTERING                           *

*        HISTORY: ADDED TRANSLATOR IDENTIFICATION MESSAGES AND        *
*        MADE SEVERAL ADDITIONAL CHANGES -                            *
*           1.  ADDED MODULE NAME FILTERING                           *

*           5.  FIXED A BUG - IF A IDR USER RECORD HAD CONTINUED      *
*               HEADER DATA, ITS DATE WAS NOT INITIALIZED.            *
*                                                                     *
*        MEMBER PROTECTION: THE DELETE, EDIT, FIXPDS, FSE, SPF AND    *
*        RENAME SUBCOMMANDS ISSUE SPF-STYLE ENQUEUE CHECKS BEFORE     *
*        UPDATING THE ALLOCATED DATA SET.  THIS ENQUEUE CHECK CANNOT  *
*        DETECT A USER FROM ANOTHER CPU UPDATING THE MEMBER THROUGH   *
*        SHARED DASD (THIS IS ALSO AN SPF PROBLEM).                   *
*                                                                     *

*        DATA SET PROTECTION: THE PDS GENERATION OPTIONS OF OLD, SHR, *
*        AND OPER HAVE BEEN REMOVED -- THE DATA SET'S INTEGRITY CAN   *
*        BE INSURED BY USING DISPOSITION "OLD" ON THE CHANGE OR PDS   *
*        SUBCOMMAND.  ALSO, SEE THE FOLLOWING NOTES ON SHR UPDATES    *
*        AND MEMBER PROTECTION.                                       *

*        SHR UPDATES: PDS NOW USES SPF RESERVE LOGIC TO PROTECT THE   *
*        INTEGRITY OF DATA SETS ALLOCATED AS SHR DURING ANY UPDATES.  *
*        THIS CHANGE AFFECTS THOSE PDS SUBCOMMANDS WHICH UPDATE THE   *
*        DATA SET BEING PROCESSED (ALIAS, ATTRIB WITH ATTRIBUTE       *
*        CHANGES, DELETE, FIXPDS, RENAME, RESTORE AND VERIFY          *
*        SUBCOMMANDS) AND WAS SUGGESTED BY ARNIE CASINGHINO WITH CBT. *

*        ESTAE PROCESSING: PDS CAN NOW RECOVER FROM ABENDS (EXCEPT    *
*        IN THE SPFEDIT AND BROWSE SUBCOMMANDS).  ENTER "HELP ABEND"  *
*        FOR MORE INFORMATION.                                        *

*        GEORGE GOFFE WITH AMDAHL CORPORATION IN SUNNYVALE, CALIF.    *
*                                                                     *
*        EXTERNAL SUBCOMMANDS: SUBCOMMANDS EXTERNAL TO PDS ARE NOW    *
*        ATTACHED INSTEAD OF LINKED TO.  THIS WAS SUGGESTED BY        *
*        SEYMOUR METZ WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT.  THIS CHANGE MAKES   *
*        THE FOLLOWING IMPROVEMENTS POSSIBLE:                         *
*           1.  PDS CAN RECOVER FROM ABENDS IN THESE SUBCOMMANDS      *
*           2.  PDS CAN FREE ALLOCATED FILES AND MOST OTHER RESOURCES *
*               OBTAINED BY THESE SUBCOMMANDS                         *
*           3.  PDS CAN PERFORM ATTENTION PROCESSING IN BEHALF OF     *
*               THESE SUBCOMMANDS                                     *
*                                                                     *
*        ATTRIB: ANY APPARENT ALIASES FOR A MEMBER ARE DISPLAYED (AS  *
*        WELL AS ACTUAL ALIASES) DURING THE ALIAS SEARCH FOR A MEMBER.*
*                                                                     *
*        ATTRIB AND MAP: ALL CORRESPONDING MAIN MEMBERS FOR AN ALIAS  *
*        MEMBER ARE DISPLAYED (NOT JUST THE FIRST ONE AS BEFORE).     *
*                                                                     *
*        BACKGROUND USE OF PDS: A BLANK LINE IS OUTPUT BETWEEN EACH   *
*        SUBCOMMAND FOR READABILITY; ALSO, THE PROGRAM CIRCUMVENTS    *
*        PROMPTS FOR YES/NO DECISIONS BY SIMULATING YES RESPONSES.    *
*                                                                     *
*        TSSO SUPPORT:  A SINGLE SUBCOMMAND MAY NOW BE ENTERED ON THE *
*        PRIMARY COMMAND LINE; PDS WILL PROCESS THE SUBCOMMAND AND    *
*        TERMINATE.  THIS WAS SUGGESTED BY ARNIE CASINGHINO WITH CBT. *
*                                                                     *
*        FIXPDS:  ADDED SUBCOMMAND TO MODIFY THE ALLOCATED DATA SET.  *
*        THE EXPANDDIR OPTION WAS DERIVED FROM FILE 288 OF THE CBT    *
*        TAPE AS SUGGESTED BY ARNIE CASINGHINO WITH CBT.              *
*                                                                     *
*        NON-PARTITIONED DATA SETS:  PARSE DATA FOR THE MEMBER NAME   *
*        POSITION   IS NO LONGER ENTERED. ALSO, SUPPORT HAS BEEN      *
*        ADDED FOR NON-PARTITIONED DATA SETS FOR BROWSE, EDIT,        *
*        DSPRINT, FIND, FSE, LIST, PRINTOFF, SPFEDIT, SUBMIT, SUBLIST,*
*        REVIEW, TSOLIST, UPDATE AND VERIFY.                          *
*                                                                     *

*        SPF AND ISPF USERS: PDS CAN BE INVOKED AS A SPF DIALOG USING *
*        THE PROVIDED SPF PANEL AND MESSAGE MEMBER.  THIS CHANGE      *
*        WAS SUGGESTED BY JAMES W. BERRY FROM WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CAL.  *
*                                                                     *
*        RENAME: IF A NON-ALIAS LOAD MODULE IS RENAMED, ADDITIONAL    *
*        CODE IN RENAME WILL UPDATE THE CHANGED NAME POINTERS IN      *

*        VERIFY: ADDED A SUBCOMMAND TO CHECK A DATA SET FOR           *

*        D.  MODIFIED FIXPDS TO ADD AN PADDING DIRECTORY BLOCK IF     *
*            A TRACK WILL BE FILLED WITH DIRECTORY BLOCKS.  THIS      *
*            IS DONE TO ENSURE THAT THE END OF FILE MARK IS ON THE    *
