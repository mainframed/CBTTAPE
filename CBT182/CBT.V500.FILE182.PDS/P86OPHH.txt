  ¢PDS+provides entry assistance for most of its subcommands.  To use
   this facility, enter O to the right of%COMMAND ===>+on any panel
   which accepts¢PDS+subcommands.  After the ENTER, the O command option
   panel will direct you as to which¢PDS+subcommands are available.

   Shorthand notes:
%   1.+ You can bypass the O command option panel.  For example, enter
       %O.VE+as a command to enter the VERIFY assistance panel.  Note:
        the following example would skip both panels:%O.VE.memname stats+
%   2.+ From the O command option panel, you can bypass the assistance
        panel.  For example, enter:%ve.mname stats+for:%Verify mname stats+

   To get explanations of¢PDS+subcommands, you need to reference the¢PDS+
   HELP data set.  Enter%O.H+from the%COMMAND ===>+line on an ISPMODE
   or MEMLIST panel to use the HELP subcommand assistance panel.
