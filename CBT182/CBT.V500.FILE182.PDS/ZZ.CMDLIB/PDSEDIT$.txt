There are two exceptions, however.  First, if the              control statements specify only strings to find (no changes,                    insertions, or deletions), no members will be written out.  Second,             the user may specify via a keyword on the PDS control statement (see            description below) that only those members which were changed are to            be written to the output PDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2.3  'Browse Mode'                                                                                                                                              If no changes, insertions, or deletions are specified in the control            statements, PDSEDIT will run 'in Browse Mode' - i.e., will produce              summary and optional detail reports but will not attempt to write out           any members.  The user may also force PDSEDIT to run in Browse Mode             for a specified PDS via a keyword on the PDS control statement (see             description below).  In this case, control statements specifyin
g                changes will be treated as if they had specified 'FIND' only, and               control statements specifying insertions and deletions will be                  ignored.  Specification of this keyword ensures that no inadvertent             changes will be made to the specified PDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                      2.4  Handling of Aliases and Directory Information                                                                                                              Aliases will not be edited (even if specifically selected), nor will            their directory entries reflect changes made to the main member.

PDS's to be edited should not be concatenated (PDSEDIT will                     handle only the first of concatenated data sets properly).

In general, words in a control statement are separated by one or more           blanks or commas.  Comments may be included:  A comment must begin              with '/*' and end with '*/' and may be inserted anywhere a blank                would be appropriate.  Control statements may begin in any column;              columns 72 through 80 are ignored.

This keyword is optional;  if omitted, edited members             will be written back into the PDS referenced by dd1.                                                                                                            FIELD(n1 n2) specifies the first and last columns to edit.  Data                    outside these bounds is not searched for specified strings.                     (note that these bounds may be overridden for an individual                     FIND or CHANGE statement).  This keyword is optional.  The                      default range is all but the last 8 columns of a fixed-length                   record or all but the first 8 columns of a variable-length                      record (the usual sequence number field).                                                                                                                   SELECT/EXCLUDE(m1 m2 ...) specifies the members to select for a                     exclude from the edit process.  This keyword is optional;  if                   omitted, all members except aliases will be edited.  Multiple                   occurrences of either SELECT or EXCLUDE are allowed, but both                   SELECT and EXCLUDE my not appear on the same PDS statement.                     'SELECT' may be abbreviated 'SEL' or 'S'; 'EXCLUDE' may be                      abbreviated 'EXCL' or 'E'.                                                                                                                                  NOCOPY specifies that only members which have been changed are to                   be written out.   This keyword is optional and is only                          meaningful if the input and output PDS's are different.  If it                  is omitted, every member which is "processed" (i.e., scanned)                   will be written into the output PDS.                                                                                                                        BROWSE specifies that PDSEDIT is to process this PDS 'in Browse                     Mode' - i.e., is to treat CHANGE statements as FIND                             statements, is to ignore INSERT and DELETE statements, and is                   not to write edited members out.  This keyword is optional; if                  it is omitted, PDSEDIT will not run in browse mode unless                       control statements are limited to PDS and FIND statements.                                                                                              A PDS statement is assumed to continue until the next occurrence of a           major keyword (PDS, FIND, CHANGE, INSERT, or DELETE).  It may                   therefore span multiple cards, with breaks between cards occurring              anywhere a blank would be appropriate (see example below).                                                                                                      Minor keywords (IN, OUT, FIELD, SELECT, and EXCLUDE) may appear in any          order, and blanks may appear before and after parentheses.

(this is a temporary override for the field keyword on the PDS                  statement).  Note that only occurrences of string1 which are                    completely contained within the specified bounds will be                        found;  e.g., an occurrence of 'ABC' starting in column n2 will                 not be found.  This parameter is optional , but if present must                 precede /string1/.                                                                                                                                          string1 is the string to be found (minimum length 1; maximum                        length 255)                                                                                                                                                 string2 is its replacement (may be null; maximum length 255)                                                                                                    '/', the string delimiter, may be any character except a blank, a                   comma, or a left parenthesis.  (it may not be a '/' if the                      first character of the string is a '*').                                                                                                                A FIND or CHANGE statement is assumed to continue until 'enough'                string delimiters are found (2 for a FIND, 3 for a CHANGE).  If column          71 is reached before the string delimiter is found, the string is               assumed to continue in column 1 of the next card.

In general, an               attempt is made to preserve column alignment.  i.e., blanks will be             added to or deleted from the next pool of 1 or more consecutive                 blanks, subject to the following restrictions:                                      1.  Blanks may not be added to or deleted from a quoted string                      except to adjust for a change made with the string.                         2.  A pool of blanks will always retain at least 1 blank (unless                    it is at the end of a quoted string).                                       3.  All adjusting is done using blanks to the right of the changed                  string; blanks are not added to or deleted from the beginning                   of the line to adjust for changes at the end of the line.               The first occurrence of a single quote anywhere in the data line (not           just in the field to be edited) is considered to begin a quoted                 string; the string is assumed to continue until the next occurrence of          a single quote, on the same or subsequent line.                                                                                                                 Insofar as possible, blanks will be added to and deleted from within a          quoted string to adjust for changes made within that string.  If                necessary, blanks may also be deleted from the next pool of more than           1 consecutive blank which is not contained within a quoted string.                                                                                              Adjusting for blanks continues to the last column specified by the              field keyword of the PDS statement (the default last-column-to-edit,            if the field keyword was omitted), or the last column specified by the          CHANGE statement, whichever is greater.                                                                                                                         If it is impossible to adjust for a change - not enough blanks can be           deleted from a fixed-length records, or the length of a variable-length         record cannot be increased sufficiently without exceeding the data              set's maximum record length - line overflow occurs.  No further FIND            or CHANGE statements will be pr
ocessed against the line, and the                change which caused the overflow will not be applied to the line.

Every time a line is found containing the string             specified as string1 by the FIND or CHANGE statement, any INSERT or             DELETE statements associated with the FIND or CHANGE are processed:             An INSERT statement inserts lines directly before or directly after             the line containing string1; a DELETE statement deletes the line                containing string1 and a specified number of subsequent lines.  Each            FIND or CHANGE may be followed by at most one INSERT before, one                INSERT after, and one DELETE (in any order - deletes are always                 processed before inserts).                                                                                                                                      An INSERT statement is directly followed by the lines to insert, with           each card assumed ot contain one line to insert.  During the edit               process, these lines will be truncated or padded with blanks to the             right if necessary to adjust for a record length other than 80.  If             the data set being edited has variable-length records, lines will be            given a record length of 80 or the data set LRECL, whichever is                 smaller.                                                                                                                                                        The user may specify a number of lines to insert, or a 2-character              delimiter which, when found in columns 1 and 2 of an input card,                signals the end of the lines to insert (the card containing the                 delimiter will not be inserted).  If neither is specified, 1 line will          be inserted.                                                                                                                                                    The INSERT statement has the following format:                                                                                                                      INSERT/INS/I  n  BEFORE/AFTER                                                       - or -                                                                      INSERT/INS/I  TO(dlm)  BEFORE/AFTER

This                      keyword is optional;  if omitted, the default is AFTER.

Edited members              will be written back into 'PRIV.PROCLIB' (but not updated in place,             since they have been enlarged).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 6.3  Replace Lines Containing a Specified String in 2 PDS's                                                                                                                                                                                     In this example, the object is to replace lines containing the string           'REPLACE' with a blank line.

Every line containing the string 'REPLACE' will be deleted; inserted            'after' the deleted line (i.e., in its place) will be the blank line.           Since the keyword 'NOCOPY' does not appear on any of the PDS                    statements, all members of 'PDS1.PROCLIB' and 'PDS2.PROCLIB' will be            written into 'PDS3.PROCLIB', whether changed or not.  Since no SYSOUT           DD statement was supplied, no detail report will be produced.
