                      CUT AND PASTE EDIT MACROS

        The CUT and PASTE Edit macros provides a handy method
        to move data from one Edit session to another. The CUT
        macro saves lines from a Edit session. The PASTE macro
        place these lines into another Edit session (or the
        same session).  The CUT macro can combine lines with
        previous saved lines.  The PASTE macro can place these
        lines into one or more Edit session.   The Edit sessions
        can be on different screens and/or Edit sessions started
        at a latter time provide you do not exit ISPF
        NOTE:
        There are other versions of CUT and PASTE with different
        features, see APPENDIX. The versions supplied with PDS
        is strategic to future interfaces to PDS tables and there
        functions.

        The CUT and PASTE macro have several optional operands.
        The operands P or PROMPT, D or DEFAULTS provide menu
        panels for entering the optional operands.  The operands
        H or HELP can be used to provide TUTORIAL panels.
        The lines from the CUT macro are saved in a ISPF table.
        A two character operand is used to name the table for
        saved lines.   A numaric operands sets the limit for the
        size of the table.  A two character operand on the
        PASTE macro names the table to obtain the lines.  A
        numaric operand is not used with PASTE.  The table name
        will default if not given.  This default can be changed.

        The CUT macro works with the Edit line commands for
        MOVE/COPY in their several forms (M, MM Mnn, C, CC, Cnn)
        to specify which group of lines to save.  The operand
        A OR ADD for the CUT macro specifies that the selected
        lines are to be added to already saved lines if any.
        The operand R or REPLACE for the CUT macro specifies
        that the lines selected are to replace or overlay the
        lines already saved.  The default, if not changed, is ADD.

        The PASTE macro works with the Edit line commands for
        After or Before (A OR B).  This specifies where all lines
        previously saved are to be inserted.  The operand Z or
        ZERO specifies that the table is to be cleared after the
        lines have been inserted.  The operand K or KEEP specifies
        that the table is not to be cleared, thus the saved lines
        are to be kept for future PASTE requests or to be added
        to by other CUT requests.  The default, if not changed, is
        ZERO.

        The use of the operands ADD, REPLACE, ZERO, and KEEP define
        the mode for the CUT and PASTE macros.  The most common
        mode could be called the "gather mode" with operands ADD
        and ZERO.  This is where several groups of lines are
        gathered from here and there and finally pasted into one
        member.   The other mode could be called the "distribution
        mode" where one group of lines is CUT and then placed in
        several members or in several spots in one member.  This
        uses the operands REPLACE and KEEP.  The defaults can be
        set for the mode you like most.   Ether mode works when
        working in the "one for one mode" where each CUT is
        followed by one PASTE.  If you set the defaults to ADD
        and KEEP you will have to keep track when to override
        with ether REPLACE or ZERO or you will accumulate lines.

        APPENDIX

        This version of CUT and PASTE uses a ISPF shared table
        in memory without the WRITE option.  Several different
        tables can be used by name to separate several CUT and
        PASTE operations.   This differs from the original
        versions presented by IBM as macro examples.  The IBM
        versions used PROFILE variables to save the Edit lines.
        This could fill up the PROFILE variable pool and is
        limited to one operation.  However the lines would be
        saved between ISPF sessions.   Other versions exist that
        use disk files to save Edit lines.  They would provide
        for several named files providing for several separate
        CUT and PASTE operations.  The lines would also be saved
        between ISPF sessions.  However the use of tables in
        memory is much faster and less likely to create problems
        of disk storage management.  If you already have your
        CUT and PASTE then rename this version to CLIP and GLUE
        for trial purposes.

        The SHOWCUT macro can be used to browse the ISPF cut table.
        A CUT table name can be entered as a parameter, otherwise the
        default name is used.

        INSTALL

        To install CUT and PASTE the 15 panels must be copied
        to your panel library and the 3 macro clists must be
        copied to your clist library. If your clist library has
        a variable record format ISPF 3.3 can be use to convert
        from the distribution library fixed format.

        The following IEBCOPY statements can be used to copy
        the panels used by CUT and PASTE clists.

           C I=((INPUT,R)),O=ISPPLIB
           S M=CUTDEF,CUTDEF@,CUTHELP@
           S M=CUTHELP1,CUTHELP2,CUTHELP3,CUTHELP4
           S M=CUTHELP5,CUTPROM,CUTPROM@,PASTEDEF
           S M=PASTEDF@,PASTEPR@,PASTEPRM
           S M=SHOWCUTP

        NOTE

        With the advent of ISPF CUT and PASTE, I have renamed these
        CUT and PASTE macros to CC and PP respectively on my system.
