   A¢PDS+subcommand has reached an output checkpoint (250 lines of data by
   default) and has been suspended so that you can examine the session log.

    %0+Continue subcommand  - allows the subcommand to continue its output
                              until the next checkpoint is reached or the
                              subcommand completes.
  %END+Terminate subcommand - simulates an attention to force control to the
                              next panel (ISPMODE log or line command output).
    %F+Find                 - positions the ISPMODE log.
    %X+Above/Below/All      - clears portions of the ISPMODE log relative
                              to the top line displayed in the log.

   Note:¢PDS+subcommands may%not+be entered on this panel; but the
   above special control codes or any ISPF command may be entered on
   the command line.
