   one of the Session View logs and that log is then displayed.
   The output that is trapped is saved in main memory and then placed
   in the view log table with is also in main memory.  In order to
   limit main memory use and the size of the view log a limit feature
   is used.  Choose a limit on the size of the output from a given
   command in lines.   All output exceeding this limit will be trashed
   by the TSO/E SYSOUTTRAP service.
