   The formal documentation for¢PDS+is in the HELP data set under the same
   member name as the¢PDS+command itself (example: both are called PDS86).
   This panel formats a HELP request for any of the defined¢PDS+subcommands.

   To get an explanation of a¢PDS+subcommand, enter the subcommand name
   or some legal abbreviation and optionally HELP keywords to indicate
   the type of information you want.  For example to get syntax and
   operand information for the VERIFY subcommand, you should enter:
  %verify sy op+after %===>+on the HELP entry assistance panel.

+  To get an explanation of¢PDS+messages such as PDS300A and PDS999E,
   you could enter:%msg msg(pds300,pds999)+ As an alternative, you can
   request PDS's extended help just after receiving a warning (PDSxxxW)
   or an error (PDSxxxE) message by entering%.?+after%COMMAND ===>+on a
   ISPMODE or MEMLIST panel.
