       This series of several installments deals with a tremendously
useful productivity aid, the PDS Program Product, Version 8.0, which
can be found on the CBT mods tape for MVS.  This product introduces
new extensions to IBM's ISPF/PDF, and has very great capabilities of
partitioned dataset member manipulation.  It is (literally) one
hundred utilities, or more, cleverly woven into one framework.

       PDS Version 8.0 also has a unique beauty in its construction
that makes it an ideal system programmer tool, dear to all those
familiar with it.  In this article of the series, I hope to convey
some of the elegance of PDS to the reader.  The many ways of doing
things in PDS, and the possibility of interweaving combinations of
different operations, make for the opportunity to creatively accomplish
things you've never done before.

       Our format in this series is to guide the reader through the
many PDS options, or SUBCOMMANDS.  For the sake of clarity, we have
grouped the PDS subcommands into FIVE SECTIONS, according to type
(see Figure 1).

       The first installment of this series dealt with the dataset
currently being handled by the PDS program.  In PDS terms, this is
called the CURRENT DATASET.  PDS has formidable capability of displaying
and changing the current dataset's characteristics and vitals.  The PDS
subcommands which deal with the current dataset as a whole are grouped
into SECTION ONE of our option list.  Part one of these articles
dealt with the PDS subcommands in SECTION ONE.

       In our last article, we introduced the reader to PDS's
time-saving ISPF INTERFACE and to PDS's great ability to operate ON
GROUPS OF PDS MEMBERS AT ONE TIME.  The fact that one can BROWSE,
EDIT, RENAME, DELETE, or PRINT a pds member from THE SAME MEMBER LIST,
without having to switch to a different ISPF option, is nothing short
of amazing to the ISPF user.  This, combined with the fact that there
can be a PARTIAL MEMBER LIST at the convenience of the viewer, makes
for some very considerable power.  The concept of a partial subset of
members extends to the user's ability to OPERATE ON ALL THE GROUP
MEMBERS IN ONE SHOT.  For example, one can select all members (or even
load modules) containing a given search string, and delete or copy
them all together.  The subcommands controlling these phases of PDS
use were covered in the last installment. Those subcommands are
roughly in SECTIONS TWO AND THREE of our subcommand list.

       This month's installment will concentrate on SECTIONS FOUR AND
FIVE of the subcommand list, dealing with individual member manipulation
and special options.  We'll show how someone who uses PDS can be like
an ordinary ISPF user, and yet have five or ten times more power.
He can do all of the same things; none of ISPF is lost when PDS is
hooked in.  However, he has many more tools at his immediate disposal,
and the whole force of PDS capability can be marshalled in one unified
session.

       We begin our discussion with the most common member manipulation
subcommands, EDIT, BROWSE, RENAME, and DELETE (or SCRATCH).  To put the
discussion in perspective, let's see how these functions are handled
in ordinary ISPF, as shipped by IBM.

       In normal ISPF, the usual way to edit a pds member is to get
into the "EDIT" ISPF option by typing "2" at the top of the main
ISPF menu.  This gets the user into the "EDIT" main menu.  Once
there, the dataset name is entered, and the user is presented with
an alphabetical list of members.  One positions to the desired member
by using the "LOCATE" or "L" command on the command line, and the
desired member is then selected, by putting the letter "S" next to its
name.  When the machine responds, the member to be edited appears on
the screen.  If one would now like to "BROWSE" or "RENAME" the member,
one cannot do so in "EDIT".  Ordinary ISPF as shipped by IBM requires
that you get out of "EDIT" and go into the "BROWSE" screen "=1" to
browse, or to the "UTILITY" screen "=3.1" to rename or delete the
member.  One must also retype the member name, or reposition the
selection list to the appropriate name, because that information is
not preserved when you change ISPF "modes" in ordinary ISPF.

       This is much simpler using PDS in ISPMODE.  First, one gets into
the PDS main screen from the initial ISPF menu (an option must be set
up for this with the PDS install).  There, a CURRENT DATASET is selected
as with ordinary "EDIT" or "BROWSE" modes.  Then, once you're into the
PDS view mode screen for the dataset, a member list can be generated
by the use of the "MEMLIST" or "ML" commands.  Here is where the PDS
advantage starts.

       First, one need not select a complete member list.  An option
"6" from the ISPMODE View Mode screen will indeed create a full member
list, but the ML command may be used with a "range" such as "ML AB:C"
or a pattern such as "ML XYZ/" to select a partial list.  This sets up
the CURRENT MEMBER GROUP as well as initially creating a partial
member list.  We discussed more particulars of this process in our
last article.

       Once a member list is obtained, the user merely enters "E" or
"S" (for SPFEDIT) next to the member name to EDIT, "B" to BROWSE, "REN"
to RENAME, "SC" or "DEL" to DELETE.  Simple.  That is the way it ought
to be.  The last command executed on a given member name in the list
is displayed in the data area to the right of the command.  This is
illustrated in Screen #1.

       Please refer to Screen #2.  The list of options available
from the MEMLIST member list is not limited to these four, but it
includes almost every PDS option which affects an individual member.
At this point we shall divide the discussion into subcommands affecting
source-type members (Program Source, JCL, printout, TSO CLISTS, any
RECFM=FB or VB libraries), and load-type libraries (load libraries,
SYS1.IMAGELIB, any RECFM=U library).  PDS has many special features
tailored to each type of library member.

       Options available from the MEMLIST screen for source-type members
include:  REVIEW, LIST, ATTRIB, ALIAS, COPY, COMPARE, FIND, REPLACE,
SUBMIT, PRINTOFF, VERIFY, COPY, REPRO, OUTCOPY and DIRENTRY, besides
the four others already mentioned.

       For load-type libraries:  MAP, ATTRIB, HISTORY, VERIFY, and
DIRENTRY are especially valuable utilities and investigative tools.
If full-screen ZAP from CBT tape file 134 is installed and available,
it can be accessed for the CURRENT DATASET by placing "Z" on the
ISPMODE command line.  ALIAS, BROWSE, COPY, REPRO, FIND, REPLACE, and
OUTCOPY are also extremely valuable for load libraries.  RESTORE is a
particularly useful tool for both types of dataset.

       In keeping with our systematic approach in covering the
features of the PDS product, we shall consider the more source-oriented
subcommands first, and we follow with the load library manipulations
afterwards.  This will cover Section Four.  Then we'll conclude
with the miscellaneous features of Section Five, and with some mention
of customization.

       To clarify and crystallize the discussion which follows, we
will talk about all these subcommands from a MEMLIST framework.  The
commands will be illustrated by examples using the MEMLIST screens.
It should be clear, however, that these commands can all be done from
the ISPMODE command line or the "Enter Options" prompt also.  In fact,
it is necessary to enter a subcommand from the command line if its
operands have more than eight characters.  Our discussion will center
around the MEMLIST screen to show the versatility of the member list
and its clear advantage over ordinary ISPF.

       We begin the source-oriented commands with REVIEW, LIST, SUBMIT,
PRINTOFF, and REPRO.  "REVIEW" or "REV" is a full screen browse-like
command that is really a separate TSO utility, completely independent
of ISPF.  It is accessible from the MEMLIST screen by placing the
letters "REV" next to the member name to be "browsed".  This REVIEW
command has its own internal "help" facility, accessible through
pfkeys.  The command is extremely handy at times, for example, if ISPF
is not available.  The REVIEW program from file 134 of the CBT
tape has to be installed for this option to work under PDS.

       The "LIST" subcommand of the PDS product is not the same as the
TSO "list" command.  (The latter is obtainable through the "TSOLIST"
or "TSOL" subcommand.)  The "PDS" LIST subcommand will place an image
of the target member into the ISPMODE VIEW LOG for scrolling.  This
image can be written out to a SYSOUT file or another dataset by means
of the "log outputting" facility, option "7" of the MEMLIST screen.
To "LIST" a member from the MEMLIST screen, type an "L" next to the
member name in the command space.

       The SUBMIT or "SUB" subcommand can be executed from MEMLIST by
placing "SUB" next to a member name containing JCL.  This command is
different from "submit from ISPF edit" in that a temporary copy of the
submitted JCL is not created during the submission.  There is a nice
technique of submitting JCL when full screen TSO is not available.
LIST is used to view the jobstream.  Tailoring of the JCL may be done,
avoiding ISPF edit, by using the FIND/REPLACE commands.  One can use
REPLACE to do minor alterations of the existing job via update
in-place.  Using this technique, I edit and submit jobs from a SYSTEM
CONSOLE, running PDS under TSSO Release 4.3 (file 404 of the CBT tape).
It is applicable under any circumstance where one wishes to avoid ISPF
edit, or where the user does not have full screen capability.

       The PRINTOFF utility (distributed with IPO, or obtainable from
several places on the CBT tape) prints a dataset or a pds member.  It
can be called from PDS if the command is installed.  "PR" is the
abbreviation you can enter from the MEMLIST screen, but "O.PR" will
provide the user with an extremely convenient panel from which to enter
the print options.  Output can be routed to any class or normal
destination.  The "O.PR" screen prompts the available options.  The
version of the PRINTOFF utility from file 325 of the CBT tape (from
Wells Fargo Bank) is an exceptionally good version of the program.
This version allows VM-type destinations for output, for example:
DEST(RSCS.VMPRINTR) or DEST(RSCS.VMUSER).  The print can then go to a
VM-controlled destination without manual intervention from VM itself.

       The "REPRO" subcommand of PDS is used to make a copy of a member
in the same pds.  It can be used for either source or load-type members.
It is quite handy.  REPRO is the subcommand to use if you want to
duplicate a pds member within the same pds.  It requires answering
a prompt of "YES".  This prompt can be turned off globally in your
session by entering "CONTROL NOPROMPT" from the command line.  It is
probably better for most sessions to retain the prompt, because other
more critical commands (such as FIXPDS RESET, which clears a pds of
its members) require the prompt also.

       The "ALIAS" subcommand does not make a copy of the member, but
makes an additional directory entry pointing to it.  The "alias" entry
provides an alternate name for accessing a pds member.  The ALIAS
subcommand of PDS works for source or load modules.  For source, I
find it useful for naming TSO help members with alternate names.
These are usually the alias names of the TSO command which the "help"
is for.

       With load modules, the ALIAS subcommand does even more.
Non-trivial entry points of a load module, that have the same name as
the new "alias" entry, are respected by the ALIAS subcommand, and the
new alias will have its own entry point, not the one of the original
member name.  If the new alias name doesn't have an entry point in the
load module corresponding to that name, the main member's entry point
is assigned as the alias member's entry point.  The ALIAS subcommand
can be entered next to a member name in a MEMLIST by entering "AL"
in the command space, and the new name in the data area.

       Speaking of pds directory entries, the odds are that you've
never seen a utility that displays and formats one.  Well you have
that utility now.  The DIRENTRY subcommand, accessible from the MEMLIST
screen by putting "DIR" next to the member name, displays a hex dump
of the directory entry for that member.  It also formats every field
in the entry, and explains its meaning to you in English.  Wow is the
word for this little tool.

       For source-type members, we basically have FIND, REPLACE,
VERIFY, and COMPARE left to discuss.

       To use the FIND subcommand for a single member on the MEMLIST
screen, enter "FIND" in the command space to the left of the member
name, and the string (up to six characters) between delimiters, in
the "data" space to the right of the member name.  See Screen #1.
Of course, the data area of the MEMLIST screen has only eight characters
in the space.  The same command entered from the command line at the
top of the screen can have a much longer operand, because the command
line has much more room.  On the MEMLIST line, you don't have to type
the member name over.  You have the choice, whichever way to do it is
most convenient.

       REPLACE is very much like FIND.  It is usually impractical to
execute a REPLACE subcommand from a MEMLIST screen, but for very short
search strings, it is possible, and I have illustrated it in Screen
#1.  The format of the REPLACE command for a string in a single member
is:
         REPL member   /scanstring/replstring/ |WRITE|  .
For a member group the REPLACE format is:
         REPL memgroup /scanstring/replstring/ |WRITE|  .
The keyword "WRITE", if present, makes the string replace permanent,
via update in-place.  Without the keyword "WRITE", the command is a
dry run, to display what WOULD BE found and replaced.

       VERIFY, for a single member, counts the number of logical
records and physical blocks.  It displays the size of the largest
physical block in the member, and it also shows the average size
of the blocks in that member.  If the member has any irregularities,
for instance, if it is marked as an alias, but no main member exists
for it, this will be shown.  VERIFY is useful for spotting troublesome
members or load modules quickly.  To execute VERIFY from a MEMLIST
screen, simply type "VER" in the command area next to the member name.

       COMPARE does a line-by line matchup between two source-type
fixed blocked members of a pds, and reports the differences.  It is
designed for 80-byte LRECL files.  It uses the COMPARE utility which
is found on CBT tape file 296.  This quick check is extremely useful
in many common circumstances, for instance, when updating JCL or
program source listings, to keep track of the changes against the
original member.  COMPARE requires the two member names as operands.
It can be executed from a MEMLIST screen by typing "COMP" in the
command area to the left of the first member's name, and typing the
second member's name in the data area to the right side of that name.
The compare report showing the differences will appear on the TSO
screen.

       It should be apparent by now, that ISPMODE operation of PDS
can combine the advantages and tools of normal ISPF with the
enormous power of the PDS subcommands.  The normal ISPF "locate"
or "L" command can be used to position a MEMLIST member list in the
same way as with any other ISPF member list.  In addition, there
is a "find" or "F" command which will position the MEMLIST downward
to find any scan string, such as a member's userid.  This extra
command is an added convenience.

       We must now talk about the special capabilities that PDS has
with load module libraries and their members.  For many users, these
load module utility features fully justify their use of the PDS product.
The utter power of PDS on load modules makes the user feel like
Superman.

       The big gun subcommands for load modules are:  ATTRIB, MAP,
HISTORY, IF, FIND, VERIFY, CONTROL, and COPY.

       "ATTRIB" or "AT", the "attribute" PDS subcommand, is big gun
number one.  Its function is to show, and also to CHANGE, load
module attributes, either for a single load module, or for a member
group of load modules.  (For source modules, ATTRIB plays with ISPF
statistics.)  Almost every load module attribute can be CHANGED ON
THE FLY with the ATTRIB subcommand.  If you forgot to linkedit a load
module as reentrant, all you have to do is say:  "AT modname RENT".
Zappo, it's now marked reentrant.  If it was linkedited as reentrant
by mistake, you just have to say:  "AT modname NORENT NOREUS".  Voila.
The reentrant attribule is gone.  "AT modname AUTH" and "AT modname
NOAUTH" make a module authorized or non-authorized with a few flicks
of a keyboard.  One can put an SSI on a module.  Simply enter:  "AT
modname SSI(ssinumbr)", and it's there.  This can also be done to a
group of modules just as easily.  "AT memgroup SSI(ssinumbr)" does the
trick just as easily as for one member.  That applies for all the
other ATTRIB capabilities.  They work for groups as well.

       If you think that's power, consider "MAP" and "HISTORY" as well.
"MAP" does a load module map of csects and entry points, similar
to the "map" option of the linkage editor.  "MAP" has some nice
non-default options, but the real winger-dinger is "MAP modname
RELINK", which can be done from a MEMLIST member entry, as well as
from the command line.  The output of this gem, is no less than THE
COMPLETE RE-LINKEDIT JCL for the load module.  This is written to
the ISPMODE View Log if you're in ISPMODE.  Using the ISPMODE
"outputting" option "7", the generated JCL can be written to a dataset
and rerun, perhaps with a few changes or different linkedit control
cards.  The linkedit attributes in the generated job are all correct,
according to the current structure of the load module.  Bet you've
never seen anything like THAT before.  Here's the beauty of PDS.

       The "HISTORY" subcommand shows the complete linkedit history
of all csects in a load module, showing csect replacement IDR records
and zap IDR records sorted by date, with the most current changes
listed first.  It is a good way of looking at a load module to see
which PTFs were applied.  This subcommand is inherited from the
original version of PDS from long ago, but like everything else in the
product, it has been jazzed up significantly.  If the "CONTROL
TRANSLATOR" option is in effect (which can be accomplished by entering
"CONTROL TRANS" on the command line), then the assembly or compile
history of the csects is included as well.  The information, of
course, is obtained from the IDR records of the load module; PDS's
ability to report such information in formatted form to the user is
thorough, and covers the ground well.

       Are we finished yet?  Not quite.  We have to look at IF, FIND,
REPLACE, and COPY for load modules, then a word about undocumented
commands, miscellaneous commands, and customization.

       The "IF" subcommand (complete with THEN and ELSE operands)
provides an exquisite, sophisticated, and extremely handy means of
selecting subgroups of members, and performing operations on the
whole group.  Load modules can be selected to be in the group by
date created or changed, or by practically any attribute.  One can
select all reentrant load modules in a library, or modules linkedited
before or after the last month, for example.  The combinations and
possibilities for such selections are practically endless.  Once
a SUBLIST has been selected, (for example, using "IF : LAST(38)
THEN(SUBLIST)", which will select all modules linkedited in the last
38 days), then a subsequent operation can be performed on the entire
selected group at once.  The number of "IF" options provided by PDS
for both source and load modules is too vast to discuss here.  A good
treatment can be found in the TSO HELP member which comes with the
PDS product.

       We mentioned in our last article that the "FIND" subcommand
finds occurrences of character strings in all members of a member
subgroup.  "FIND" also has THEN-ELSE logic connected with it, just
as "IF" does.  For example, we may want to know which module of a
package produces a certain operator message.  The operator message we
want to know about is $HASP249.  The product is JES2, which resides on
SYS1.LINKLIB and SYS1.LPALIB.  All the JES2 modules begin with the
letters "HAS".  After setting the CURRENT DATASET to SYS1.LINKLIB with
the command "Change SYS1.LINKLIB", we can enter:  "FIND HAS: /HASP249/
THEN(SUBLIST)".  PDS will look at all members whose names begin with
"HAS" in SYS1.LINKLIB and which also contain the string "HASP249".
Then a SUBLIST or member group will be created, such that each member
fulfills these conditions.  This subgroup can be referred to later
by the asterisk "*" designation.  For example, you may want to restrict
a subsequent "FIND" operation to this current group.  The command
"FIND * /HASP249/" will display all the actual occurrences of and
locations of the string at the TSO tube, or in the ISPMODE view log.

       It's a pity that I had to leave the "COPY" and "COMPRESS"
subcommands for last.  "COPY" is so useful, that it deserves a more
prominent place in our discussion.  "COPY" can create NEW COPIES of a
dataset as well as copy a selection of members from one dataset to
another.  "COPY" can optionally pull all the aliases into the copy
automatically, together with the original member names.  The only
drawback in COPY is setting it up, because the IEBCOPY program from
IBM must be authorized in order to run, and the ISPF environment (as
well as PDS in general, usually) is not an authorized environment.
Having the vendor copy product PDSFAST (from SEA) is one solution;
PDSFAST doesn't run authorized.  There are several ways of setting up
the COPY command to run, as described in the PDS install literature
which comes with the product.  All I need say here is that it is well
worth setting up.  The same remarks apply to the "COMPRESS"
subcommand, which does on-line compresses to the current dataset.

       I promised to talk about "undocumented" options, specialized
subcommands and customization.  There is a member in the PDS install
library which describes unpublicized commands and some tricks and
hints.  For instance, the "K" or "KLEAR" command can be used to clear
the screen.  The "TIME" command formats a nice time and date message.
The "SCRATCH" command and the "DELETE" command mean the same thing.
The "EDIT" and "SPFEDIT" subcommands mean the same thing, and so on.
Also, PDS has a "UTILITY" connection in ISPMODE that can be customized
to accept new commands within the PDS environment.  So much for that.
The literature is available on the PDS install dataset if you want
to delve deeper.

       Invocations to several vendor commands are supported by PDS
which I relegated to Section Five, because not every shop has these
commands.  These are "DSPRINT", "VPSPRINT", and "FSE".

       "TSOEDIT", which invokes the old TSO EDIT command, is seldom
used by most people, but it is available in the PDS environment.
"TSOLIST", or the actual TSO "LIST" command, is also available.
Enough said.

       A last word about customization, and that's it.  When PDS is
installed, there is a copy member with a large number of assembler
globals that control the default operation of how PDS will work.
There are maybe 70 to 100 things that can be set in there.  Some of
the defaults most likely will not be appropriate or best for your
environment.  Others will result in commands being not as easy to use
as they could have been if the options had been set otherwise.  As
always, it pays to investigate.

       Well, I can't tell you that now you know everything about PDS.
I can assure you that with this background, you're in a position to be
a far more productive system programmer.  Learning to get new results
and techniques from the PDS product is a continuous process.  Growing
is part of this territory.  But then, growing is what our job is all
about.
