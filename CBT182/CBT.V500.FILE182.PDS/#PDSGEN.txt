*** THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS SET SUBCOMMAND NAMES.  NOTE THAT
*** THESE SUBCOMMAND NAMES ARE CURRENTLY LISTED IN THE ORDER
*** OF THE SUBCOMMANDS IN THE #PDSTBL COPY MEMBER:
***   A.  TO NULLIFY A SUBCOMMAND, CODE ITS SETC VALUE AS ''
***   B.  TO RENAME A SUBCOMMAND, CHANGE ITS SETC VALUE TO A
***       DIFFERENT VALUE (ONE TO EIGHT CHARACTERS).
***         1.  NOTE THAT DUE TO THE SUBCOMMAND NAME SCAN USED,
***             ALIASES FOR OTHER SUBCOMMANDS MAY CHANGE.
***         2.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF DSPRINT WERE RENAMED TO EXTRA, THE
***             SUBCOMMAND "E " WOULD BECOME "EXTRA" INSTEAD OF
***             "EDIT" DUE TO THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF "DSPRINT"
***             AND "EDIT" IN THE SUBCOMMAND SCAN TABLE -- THE FIRST
***             MATCH FOR THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS ENTERED IS USED.
***         3.  TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM WHEN YOU RENAME ANY SUBCOMMANDS,
***             EDIT MEMBERS #PDSTBL AND #DIATBL AFTER THIS MEMBER
***             AND MOVE THE LINES REPRESENTING SUBCOMMANDS TO THEIR
***             DESIRED NEW POSITIONS.
***   C.  IF SUBCOMMANDS ARE NULLIFIED OR RENAMED, BE SURE TO MAKE
***       CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE HELP MEMBER AND THE ISPF PANELS.
***   D.  TO PREVENT THE USE OF ANY SUBCOMMAND ABBREVIATION, CODE
***       ONE OF THE &NABX STATEMENTS TO ANY SUBSTRING DESIRED.  FOR
***       EXAMPLE, TO PREVENT THE USE OF THE SUBCOMMANDS "E " OR "EN ",
***       YOU COULD CODE:  &NAB1  SETC  'EN'

*  A TSO COMMAND REQUESTED WITH THE TRAP OPTION WILL OPERATE
*  WITHOUT TRAPPING THE OUTPUT, THE OUTPUT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO
*  THE USERS SCREEN IN THE NORMAL WAY.  THIS OPTION CAN BE SET
*  BY THE INDIVIDUAL USER THROUGH THE PDS SETTRAP DIALOG COMMAND.
