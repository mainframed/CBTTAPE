   The SORT command may be used to sort the volume table.

   Syntax for the SORT command is as follows:
    %SORT      VOLUME  ADDRESS  TYPE
    %          SPACE/TOTAL  LARGEST  COUNT  USED  ASCEND/DESCEND
+
+ +where -
      %VOLUME         -+sort by volume name  (default)
      %ADDRESS        -+sort by device address
      %TYPE/DEVTYPE   -+sort by device type
      %SPACE/TOTAL    -+sort by total free SPACE (cylinders and tracks)
      %LARGEST        -+sort by LARGEST free cyls
      %COUNT          -+sort by number of current users
      %USED           -+sort by space used on volume
      %ASCEND/DESCEND -+sort direction (ASCEND is default)

   Notes: VOLUME is always assumed as the last sort field.
          TYPE can be used with TOTAL, LARGEST, COUNT, or USED.
          When used with another keyword, TYPE is the first sort field.
          The table will be presorted by ADDRESS if first LISTV used ADDRESS.
          ASCEND/DESCEND can be used once with any other keywords.
