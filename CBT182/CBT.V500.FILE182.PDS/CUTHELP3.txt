        The CUT macro works with the Edit line commands for
        MOVE/COPY in their several forms (M, MM, Mn, C, CC, Cn)
        to specify which group of lines to save.  The operands
        A or ADD for the CUT macro specifies that the selected
        lines are to be added to already saved lines if any.
        The operand R or REPLACE for the CUT macro specifies
        that the lines selected are to replace or overlay the
        lines already saved.  The default, if not changed, is ADD.
