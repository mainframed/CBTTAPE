%Wait for space:+NO means that if VTOC space request is made
     for a VTOC command or SPAC line command and the volume is
     reserved or the VTOC is enqueued the space request is bypassed.
     If YES is specified the system will wait on the volume to
     obtain the space information.  If an enqueue is active on a
     volume or reserve is active there could be some wait before the
     volume is free.  This could be more than several minutes if the
     volume is held for a backup process. To avoid delays in processing
     the LISTV request a NO should be used as the default.
     If such delays are not common at your installation then use
     NO as a default to avoid missing space information that may
     happen by chance on a short allocation request from another user.
