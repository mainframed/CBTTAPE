   The CUT and PASTE Edit macros provide a handy method to move data
   from one Edit session to another.  The PASTE Default panels provides
   for selecting the MODE for the PASTE operation and for setting the
   defaults for both CUT and PASTE for future operations.
   The mode for the PASTE operation is either ZERO or KEEP.
   The table name can also be set for his one request as well as
   the limit on the number of lines that are allowed to be saved.
   The defaults for the same can also be set.  Also the default
   for CUT can be set to REPLACE or ADD.
