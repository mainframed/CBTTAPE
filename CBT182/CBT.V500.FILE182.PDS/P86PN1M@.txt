  ¢PDS+subcommands which allow member name specifications generally
   allow use of a list of members, a group of members or both (a list
   of group member names).

   After a member specification has been entered, that group is termed
   the "default group" and it may be represented by entering a single
   * in the member name position.

   The following topics are presented in sequence or may be requested
   by number:
    %1+ : or range member groups
    %2+ / or pattern member groups
    %3+ * or combination member groups
    %4+ list notation for members
    %5+ member naming and hexadecimal data
    %6+ member naming and lower-case
