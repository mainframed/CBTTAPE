  ¢PDS+is a TSO command for Partitioned Data Sets and Partitioned Data
   Sets Extended (PDSE's).  You can control¢PDS+with subcommands which
   manipulate the entire partitioned data set or process individual
   partitioned data set members.

  ¢PDS+has not yet been initialized; you are requested to enter the
   names of a subset of members that are to be in the initial member
   list (or MEMLIST).  The member information entered will be formatted
   into standard¢PDS+member notation and saved for the¢PDS+entry panel.

   For more information on PDS, press%ENTER+to display the next screen
   which is a directory for most of the ISPF tutorial information on
   PDS.  Additional information is available in the HELP data set;
   a panel to assist you with the help information may be obtained
   by entering%O.HE+from an ISPMODE or MEMLIST panel in PDS.
