   The option EXCLUDE ALL of YES will direct the EQUAL  macro to first
   exclude all edit lines before processing the FIND or CHANGE.
   This will allow the matched or changed lines to stand out.

   The EQUAL  macro when used in the FIND mode can setup the RCHANGE
   edit function normally assigned to PF6 for the user.  By specifying
   YES to this option and providing a CHANGE TO string the PF5 and PF6
   keys can be used to make selected changes.

   When using the CHANGE function one may want to verify that changes
   are appropriate.  The AUTOSAVE OFF PROMPT option when set to YES will
   prevent the changes from taking effect if the END key is used by
   accident.  Note that this setting may be retained in the edit profile.
