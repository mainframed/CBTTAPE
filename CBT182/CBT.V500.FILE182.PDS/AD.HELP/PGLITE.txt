)F Function -
 The PGLITE exec supports PDSE V2 member generations and is based on
 the critically acclaimed Lionel B. Dyck PDSEGEN dialog which runs
 under the ISPF Dialog Manager.

 PGLITE is a simpler version, or subset, of PDSEGEN.

=LOCATE
)F Function -

 Locate will locate the mbr: value in the Name column.
 The member list will be positioned to the closest matching row.

)X Syntax - Locate value
 Defaults - If value is null, last member name edited.

=FIND
)F Function -

Find will find the mbr/ value in the Name column.

)X Syntax - Find value

=RFIND
)F Function -

Repeat Find will find the next mbr/ value in the Name column.

The ISPF command table must have a user controlled variable for RFIND
in order for this to work properly.

    Verb      T  Action
                    Description
    RFIND     0  &USRRFIND
                    User controlled variable for RFIND
    RFIND     0  SETVERB
                    REPEAT FIND

If you can not update the installation ISPF command table, here is
a rexx solution you can add to PGLITE early on in the exec.

    zctverb  = "RFIND"
    zcttrunc = 0
    zctact   = "&USRRFIND"
    zctdesc  = "User controlled variable for RFIND"
    'vget (zsctpref)'
    ctab = zsctpref'cmds'
    'tbtop' ctab
    'tbsarg' ctab
    'tbscan' ctab 'arglist(zctdesc) condlist(EQ) Next'
    if rc > 0 then 'tbadd' ctab
    usrrfind = null
    'vput (usrrfind)'

)X Syntax - RFind

=CHANGE
)F Function -

Change will allocate and switch to another DSNAME.

)X Syntax - Change dsname

A "CHANGE .llq" command will allocate and switch using the current
DSNAME with the low-level qualifier (llq) substituted.

<Before>
  PGLITE®                  AD.RACFADM.EXEC
  Command ===> change .panels

<After>
  PGLITE®                  AD.RACFADM.PANELS
  Command ===>

=FLIP
)F Function -

FLip will switch to the previously allocated PDS that was used.

)X Syntax - FLip

=REFLIST=IRL
)F Function -

REFList will invoke the ISPF Reference list dialog showing the
last 30 referenced datasets.  Any dataset in the list can be
selected and switched to.

The MORE command can be used to display other Personal Data Set Lists.

)X Syntax - REFList

   Aliases  - IRL

=REFRESH
)F Function -

REFresh will refresh the member list by reinvoking the PDSEGENI
DESERV routine to read the PDS directory.  Non-zero generation
members are displayed in blue, and zero generation members are
displayed in cyan.

)X Syntax - REFresh

=SELECT
)F Function -

Select will invoke ISPF Edit for a given member and generation.

A REFresh will be performed after an Edit SAVE operation, thus
updating the generation member numbers in the display.  Enter a
Locate command with no operand to position back to the member
that was saved.

)X Syntax - Select member generation

=BIG
)F Function -

BIG will invoke the critically acclaimed Lionel B. Dyck PDSEGEN
dialog.

If no filter is specified, the default is the member name after the
member list header.  The rationale being faster entry into PDSEGEN.

You can combine BIG with a PDSEGEN primary command using the ISPF
command delimiter, such as the following:

  big;backup
  big;restore
  big;copy
  big;model
  big;prune

)X Syntax - Big filter

=CLIST
)F Function -

CLIST will view the last SuperC Compare listing generated by the
Z line command (Edit Compare non-0 gen to gen 0).

)X Syntax - CLIST

=REAL
)F Function -

Real will change the member list display to reflect the real member
name and generation contained in the PDSEGEN backup dataset.

   DELETE (PGL0000)
/* Drop previous PGL levels if installed under SMP.

 Documentation.
    This is an an SMP install of PGLITE.

 Directions.
    The panels, execs, help, and object must be extracted and removed
    from the PGLITE exec and copied to SMPPREFX.PGPSORC.  These members
    can be extracted with the SPFX command.

    The LoadISPF/DropISPF routines should be nullified in PGLITE.
    Skeldd should be overridden by the do_pgxlite routine.

      Change..> DropISPF: Procedure; return 0    /* PGXLITE */
      Change..> LoadISPF: Procedure; return 0    /* PGXLITE */

                parse var load_info . . . . skeldd .
      Add.....> call do_pgxlite                  /* PGXLITE */
                parse var load_info . . . . skeldd .
      Add.....> call do_pgxlite                  /* PGXLITE */

    This member is then received.

    Libraries to be allocated:
      80 byte FB  :     PGPEXE, PGPPNL, PGPHLP, PGPOBJ
      Load library:     PGPLINK
      This library:     PGPSORC
      One DLIB    :     APGPSRC

    These must be made known to the SMP procedure, or as DDDEFs.

    secondary space):
