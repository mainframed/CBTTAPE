       In my last article, which was an introduction to Public
Domain software available for MVS, I mentioned one of the most
amazing products, the PDS program product.  This is a facility that
one literally can't afford to do without.  It is unbelievably
powerful and a great time saver.  The main thing is that you must
learn how to use its many features.

       STARTING to use PDS has proven to be the greatest barrier.
PDS has many subcommands, each of which in turn, has a variety of
options.  (Help!!)  The new user, unaware of the things he
potentially can do, and swamped by the number of things to choose,
doesn't know where to start.  In this article, we'll use a method of
progression developed for my course on PDS.  It is a methodology to
get you INTO PDS.  Once you know how PDS works, you can expand your
knowledge on your own.  It's just a question of learning "where
everything is at".

       We should begin from what PDS is.  PDS is a facility for
manipulating a DATASET, which can be either PARTITIONED or SEQUENTIAL.
Other types can also be dealt with, but for simplicity, we shall
restrict our discussion to these two types.  PDS is a TSO COMMAND
PROCESSOR.  At minimum, we can enter PDS from TSO READY, by typing
PDS 'dataset.name' or PDS80 'dataset.name', depending on what name
we have given to the PDS load module.  PDS must always point to a
dataset (which we call the "current dataset").  If we try to enter
"PDS" from TSO READY, without a target dataset, there will be a TSO
prompt:  "ENTER NAME OF DATASET".  Suppose we enter a dataset name.
The resulting display will look like the following:

- DSN=TST2SSG.SMP.CNTL,VOL=SER=TSO001  MEM=
PDS80 -- VERSION 8.0

DISP UNIT OPT RECFM LRECL BLKSIZE   ALLOCTRK FREETRK SECONDARY FREEDIR
SHR  3380 W   FB       80    3120   2X    36       0    30 TRK      46

ENTER OPTION -- DSN=TST2SSG.SMP.CNTL,VOL=SER=TSO001  MEM=

       This display itself is almost worth the price.  It can be
recreated by entering the DSNAME or DSN subcommand.  You'll notice
that the basic PDS prompt is "ENTER OPTION", just as the basic prompt
for TSO is "READY".  Suppose we take the hint and enter "OPTIONS" or
"O".  What will appear is a list of about 48 options or SUBCOMMANDS,
in PDS parlance.  This gives you quite a choice!

       So where do you start?  Here's where this article comes in.
Basically, we're here to ORGANIZE the options, so we can get decent
coverage of them--a good once-over.  This will give you the knowledge
to get going on your own.

       Please take a look at the organized list of PDS options in
Figure 1.  This is merely a re-sorted and re-commented list of what
you get when you enter the PDS "OPTIONS" command yourself.  We have
divided the subcommands into five general groups.  As we cover the
commands in each group, the general nature of the capabilities of PDS
will gradually fall into perspective, and you'll start to get the
picture.  (This will bring you to the stage where I am.  I've just
about started to get the picture myself.)  The whole thing should
take about three articles, and I'm ready if you are!  (Really, it's
worth the time spent.  Your productivity rate will start to fly.)

       OK.  The first class of commands deals with the "current
dataset" itself.  Remember that the PDS command processor must always
be pointed at a "current dataset".  If you want to change the
"current dataset", all you have to do is enter a "CHANGE" or "C"
subcommand followed by the TSO-qualified new dataset name after the
"ENTER OPTIONS" prompt.  PDS will switch to the new dataset and show
you the new dataset's characteristics.

       Let's look at the some of the subcommands in SECTION ONE.
We've mentioned the "OPTIONS" subcommand, now let's discuss "HELP".
Help is what we always need, especially with such a versatile product.
I'll assume you installed the "HEL" full-screen TSO help program from
CBT tape file 296, and genned the "HEL" TSO help option when you
installed PDS from the CBT tape.  Now when you see the "ENTER
OPTIONS" prompt, enter "H" or "HELP" followed by a subcommand name.
You'll get a full-screen scrollable view of the 6000-line PDS help
member, but conveniently positioned to the subcommand you want.  You
can scroll up and down as much as you want for as long as you want.
This is convenient to say the least.  The full-screen help program
"HEL" is a separate TSO command, called by PDS, which can be used to
view other TSO help datasets as well.  If this is working, you now
have a lot of help available.  (Be sure the PDS help member has an
alias of "PDS80" in your SYSHELP dataset.  In later releases, this
should be "PDS81", etc.)

       What's next?  "END".  If you see the "ENTER OPTIONS" prompt
and you enter "END", you'll pop out of PDS.  This will even happen
if you enter "EN".  But if you enter "E" alone, PDS will try to allocate
ISPF datasets and "EDIT" the dataset you're currently pointing to.
This is because of the way PDS subcommands are set up.  You can
abbreviate to the point of uniqueness, but beyond that, PDS has a table
of preference for subcommands, and EDIT is higher on that table than
END.  Therefore if you try entering "E" alone, EDIT is the command
that PDS chooses to execute, and not END.

       "DSNAME" is next on the list.  We saw what you get when you
enter this subcommand at the "ENTER OPTIONS" prompt.  That should be
all of DSNAME, right?  NO!  That's definitely not right.  Here, we'll
begin to sense the unique beauty of the PDS product.  There are THREE
"DSNAME" displays.  Enter "DSN MSG" and you get the above display.
Enter "DSN TSO" and you get the equivalent information in the format
of the TSO ALLOCATE command:

ALLOC F(SYS00026) DA('TST2SSG.SMP.CNTL') SHR UNIT(3380) -
  RECFM(F B) LRECL(80) BLKSIZE(3120) OPTCD(W) VOLUME(TSO001) -
  TRA SPACE(36,30) DIR(91)               /*FREE TRK=0,FREE DIR=46*/

Finally, if you enter "DSN JCL", the format is that of a JCL dataset
allocation:

//SYS00026  DD  DSN=TST2SSG.SMP.CNTL,DISP=SHR,UNIT=3380,
//  DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120,OPTCD=W),VOL=SER=TSO001,
//  SPACE=(TRK,(36,30,91))               /*FREE TRK=0,FREE DIR=46*/

Good automatic formatting?  We'll see more and more, that the whole
product is pervaded with such versatility.  These formats are not just
pretty pictures, but they will prove to be darn useful.  We'll see
that from ISPMODE, all of these generated outputs can be written to a
file for subsequent use.  They can prove to be machine-readable
timesavers for your later processing.

       Let's go further down our list.  We'll look at the "USAGE"
or "U" subcommand.  This shows us a thorough picture of the dataset's
vitals.  Enter "U" at the "ENTER OPTION" prompt and you get the
display below.  Adding any extra character such as "U T" gives you
the track map of the dataset as well.  (In PDS 8.1, "U ALL" will also
dump the entire VTOC entry for the current dataset, and will format
each field of the VTOC.  Wow!)  For our dataset...

       Not bad, not bad.  We're now about half way down the list in
Section One.  For completeness at this point, it's probably best to
mention some stuff from Section Two and talk about ISPMODE a bit.
Then we'll be able to finish Section One with better perspective.

       What's ISPMODE?  Remember that PDS is a TSO command processor.
In non-ISPMODE, or what we'll call LINE MODE, the results of the PDS
subcommands are output to the terminal, as in any TSO command.  When
PDS is in ISPMODE however, it is operating in a full ISPF environment,
and it is an ISPF dialog manager.  Prompting lines for subcommands are
at the top of the full screen ISPMODE displays, while the results
of the commands go to a scrollable DISPLAY LOG at the bottom of the
screen.  Another name for this scrollable DISPLAY LOG is VIEW MODE.
There are three other ISPMODE scrollable displays supported in the
current version (8.0) of PDS.  They are MEMLIST, LISTA, and LISTV.
You can switch back and forth between them.  We'll get to a discussion
of them by and by.

       If ISPF is available in the TSO environment, ISPMODE may be
entered from a PDS session in LINE MODE, merely by entering "ISPMODE"
or "ISPM" at the "ENTER OPTIONS" prompt.  PDS will then allocate all
relevant ISPF datasets and call itself again as a dialog manager.  PDS
can also be entered directly in ISPMODE from an ISPF menu option. You
can refer to the PDS installation literature for more direction on how
to set this up.  The information can be found in the install pds that
comes from CBT tape file 182.

       For now, I'd like to mention the existence of the "Data Table
Output" option "7" in ISPMODE.  This option is used to write the
ISPMODE LOG to a disk dataset or to SYSOUT, thus preserving the results
of your PDS subcommands.  All four ISPMODE scrollable displays have
this capability.

       Now we can go on to finish the commands of Section One.
The "DISPLAY" and "PATTERN" subcommands display subsets of members
of the "current dataset" if it is partitioned.  "DISPLAY" deals with
ranges of names in collating sequence order.  "DISPLAY" or "D" without
any operands displays all members.  The colon ":" is the range
indicator.  "D A:C" will display all members in collating sequence
starting from those beginning with "A" thru those beginning with "C".
If you genned the "display delimit" option when you installed PDS
(&CONDRNG  SETC  'Y' in #PDSGEN), the subcommand "D A" will mean the
same as the command "D A:A".  This allows easy abbreviation of DISPLAY
commands and has other unexpected dividends.  If you don't gen this
option at install time, then "D A" will mean "D A:x'FF'", and the
display will fly off to the end of the directory.

       "PATTERN" displays all members containing a string.  The string
does not have to occur at the beginning of the name, but can occur
anywhere in the member name.  The control character indicating "PATTERN"
is the slash, "/".  "DISPLAY ABC/" or "PATTERN ABC" will display all
member names containing the string ABC, such as EXABC, ABCDE, OR XABCY.
The DISPLAY and PATTERN subcommands have many variations in their use,
and you'd be advised to see the HELP entries for them.

       At this point, there is an important PDS concept that should
be introduced.  This is the MEMBER GROUP.  You always have a default
MEMBER GROUP if your current dataset is partitioned.  (It can be EMPTY
or UNDEFINED if you haven't defined it yet with one of the subcommands
from Section Three or Section Four).  The member group can either be
defined as a rule with the MEMBERS subcommand (using logic from DISPLAY,
PATTERN, or a combination of these - see HELP GROUP), or as a list of
member names, with the SUBLIST subcommand.  The fact that PDS keeps
track of MEMBER GROUPS allows it to do subcommand operations on many
members at a time.  We don't want to discuss MEMBER GROUPS now.  They
are the main topic of the next article.  Suffice it to say that the
"MEMBERS" subcommand of PDS will display or redefine the "current
member group".  So will the "SUBLIST" subcommand.  To learn more about
groups, you should refer to the TSO HELP for PDS under HELP MEMBERS,
HELP SUBLIST, and the special entry HELP GROUP.  (There is no GROUP
subcommand in PDS.)

       How does this relate to DISPLAY and PATTERN?  DISPLAY and
PATTERN do not alter the "current member group".  However the internal
logic used for the DISPLAY and PATTERN subcommands in PDS code
IS used in executing OTHER subcommands which DO alter the current
group.

       Next case.  The "RECALL" or "R" subcommand is particularly
useful throughout your travels in PDS-land.  If "R" is entered from
the command line in ISPMODE or from the "ENTER OPTION" prompt, you
will get a display of the last command you entered. In ISPMODE, the
RECALL subcommand has the additional capability of finding previous
commands entered, that are still in the VIEW MODE log. The RECALL
ISPF panel prompts you how to use the facility, and it saves you
a lot of retyping.

       We are left with the "TSO", "COMPRESS", "VERIFY", "FIXPDS",
and "CONTROL" subcommands to complete our discussion of Section One.
"TSO" allows the execution of an arbitrary TSO command while we are
still within a PDS session.  It can (and should) be abbreviated to
"TS" or "T".  Why?

       When you are using ISPF, there is a "TSO" prefix you can issue
from the command line of any ISPF panel.  The prefix "TSO" allows you
to execute a TSO command that is typed after it.  The facility is a
part of native ISPF, and not of PDS.  Now what if we are using PDS in
ISPMODE, and we enter "TSO" on the command line of an ISPMODE panel
followed by a TSO command.  What gets executed, ISPF's TSO, or PDS's
"TSO"?  The answer is ISPF's TSO.  (In LINE MODE execution of PDS,
this is not a problem.)  So when you abbreviate PDS's "TSO" command to
"TS" or "T", you can be sure you're not getting the ISPF version.

       What's the difference?  It makes a difference to execute PDS's
version, because you can gen PDS so that "TS" really means "TSO
TSOEXEC" (for users having TSO/E).  That way, you can efficiently
execute authorized TSO commands, even though you are within ISPF.
The TSOEXEC command that comes with TSO/E allows execution of
authorized commands from within ISPF, and it is quicker to type "T"
than to type "TSO TSOEXEC".  Saves your fingers.

       The "COMPRESS" subcommand invokes the program IEBCOPY to
compress a partitioned dataset.  IEBCOPY has the hitch that it must
run authorized, and it is somewhat difficult to get an authorized
program to run under TSO.  Special measures must be taken.  There are
several programs described in the #PDSGEN install member which do the
authorization process for IEBCOPY.  They are either the SPFCOPY front
end for IEBCOPY, which calls a user SVC (info can be found in the ISPF
program directory from IBM or file 300 on the CBT tape).  Or the TSO
module IKJEFTSR (which is dangerous because it accepts attention
interrupts during a compress).  If you have the vendor product PDSFAST
(sold by Software Engineering Associates of Lake Success, New York),
this is the most convenient COMPRESS and COPY program of all.  It
doesn't have to be authorized, and PDS is fully compatible with it.
PDSFAST is also much faster than IEBCOPY, making foreground compresses
more convenient.  You can gen PDSFAST as PDS's COPY or COMPRESS
program during the install process.  The second best COPY/COMPRESS
choice is probably SPFCOPY, if your company doesn't have PDSFAST.

       "CONTROL" sets certain PDS internal mechanisms and display
defaults for subcommands.  If you enter the "CONTROL" subcommand
without any operands, one of the items shown will be the available
virtual storage for your TSO session.  CONTROL can be very significant
when you know more about how PDS works, but for now, I'll just refer
you to the TSO help for it.

       "VERIFY" "verifies" the current dataset or its members.  It
does all kinds of block size measurements and other things.  It tries
to make sure that the members have characteristics consistent with the
DCB attributes of the dataset, and that the members are consistent
with each other.  When there's something wrong, you get a message.
VERIFY also counts logical records and physical blocks.  You get a
statistical report concerning them.

       Some examples of VERIFY messages:  If you do a VERIFY on a
dataset, and a member has a block size bigger than what's in the DCB,
this will show up.  If there are members which are "orphaned" (marked
as aliases but with no main member) or "apparent aliases" (not marked
as aliases, but two members point to the same disk location), that
will show up.  A VERIFY run will also show how many tracks can be
gained by a compress.  There is much more.  As usual, please refer to
the TSO help member for this subcommand.

       "FIXPDS" is an extremely multifaceted subcommand incorporating
at least ten functions in one.  Space prohibits a big discussion here,
but I'll try to whet your appetite before sending you off to the HELP
member.

       You can use FIXPDS to reduce the current dataset's unused
allocated space, without deleting and reallocating the dataset.  It
just gets rid of the extra space.  Another thing you can do is to
release the space taken up by the dataset's unused extents, or you can
release all the unused space.  These features of FIXPDS use the
RELEASE program from File 296 of the CBT tape.  You can add or reduce
the number of DIRECTORY BLOCKS a pds has, ON THE FLY, with the
"EXPANDDIR" and "FREEDIR" options of FIXPDS.  You can change many of
the DCB characteristics of the dataset ON THE FLY.  For instance you
can change the RECFM, DSORG, or BLKSIZE.  You can also clear a pds of
all its members, and optionally readjust the number of directory
blocks while doing so.  Pretty good, and there's much more in FIXPDS.

       Well we got through Section One!  We already know enough now to
start working with the PDS product and to get some major use out of it.
We also have enough information to start exploring ahead on our own.
However, there's a lot of BASIC work still to cover.

       We still don't know much about manipulating GROUPS of members at
once.  I haven't even mentioned the magnificent "MEMLIST" capability,
that allows ISPF BROWSE or EDIT or RENAME or PRINTOFF (and 20 other
things) from a SINGLE fullscreen list of pds members.  "MEMLIST" also
makes possible exquisitely delicate manipulation of the member GROUPS.

       So there's lots more to follow folks!!!  Tune in next month...
same time... same station.
