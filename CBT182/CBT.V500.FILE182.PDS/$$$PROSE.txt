+                            ____________
- This document is intended to provide systems programmers and
  other users of the PDS command with examples and notes on using
  the command effectively.
-
     History
+    _______
0    PDS was originally written in 1972 at Fireman's Fund Insurance.

     Since that time it has gone through many revisions at several
     installations and PDS is now known by various command names in
     the user community:  PDS, LPDS, LISTPDS, PDS18 and PDS4.

     Since the PDS command was written, it has grown in size and
     complexity:
 '      A.  Number of subcommands (was 12, now 46)
 '      B.  Number of source statements (was 4050, now 28500)
 '      C.  Number of HELP statements (was 500, now 5120)
 '      D.  Size of load module (was 16K, now 132K)
-
     Purpose
+    _______
0    The PDS command was designed to manipulate PDS's or partitioned
     data sets.  In the past, only non-authorized functions have been
     performed by the PDS command.

     Sequential data sets are also allowed for several of the PDS
 '   subcommands which process target data sets (BROWSE, COPY, DSPRINT,
     EDIT, FIND, FIXPDS, FSE, LIST, PRINTOFF, REPLACE, REVIEW, SUBMIT,
     TSOEDIT, TSOLIST, VERIFY and VPSPRINT).  The documented syntax
     is changed in that no data is entered for the member name
     position.

     Thus, a LIST subcommand such as LIST MEMBERXX SKIPREC(20) for a
     partitioned data set would be entered as LIST SKIPREC(20) for a
     sequential data set.
-
     Operation
+    _________
0    The PDS command accepts the name of a target data set, allocates
     the data set, and processes subcommands entered by the user.

     PDS is a standard TSO command processor which uses PUTLINE,
     GETLINE, and PUTGET MACRO's for terminal communication.  PDS
     subcommands which perform full screen output use ISPF dialog
     services.

+                            ___________
- Several of the terms relating to partitioned data sets are defined
  in this section.
-    PDS or Partitioned Data Set - a data set with fixed, variable or
+    ___________________________
     undefined format which is commonly used as a library for related
     types of information.  Partitioned data sets contain two segments
     of data: a directory of information and member data.

     PDS directory -  a segment of a PDS which is a sequential data set
+    _____________
     with eight byte keys and 256 byte data records containing pointers
     to data in the PDS member portion of the data set.

     PDS member data - a segment of a PDS which contains current members
+    _______________
     (which are pointed to by one or more directory entries) and inactive
     or deleted members (which have no associated directory entries).

     PDS directory entry - a logical entry in a PDS directory which points
+    ___________________
     to its associated data in the member data; it consists of an eight
     character member name field and at least one three-character relative
     address field.

     Load library -  a partitioned data set which has record format U, UA
+    ____________
     or UM and is commonly used to contain executable modules.

     Member -  data in a partitioned data set which is pointed to by one
+    ______
     or more PDS directory entries.

     Load module -  a member contained in a load library.
+    ___________

     Alias member -  a directory entry with a indicator value which
+    ____________
     indicates that the member entry is an alternate name for another
     main member; a main member and its aliases are associated with the
     same recorded data in the PDS.

     Main member -  a non-alias directory entry and its associated
+    ___________
     recorded data (a main member may also be called a real member).

     Orphan member - an alias member which does not have an associated
+    _____________
     main member.

     Deleted member -  member data which is not pointed to by any
+    ______________
     directory entry; deleted members remain in a PDS until the
     data set is compressed.

     Apparent alias member -  data in a partitioned data set which
+    _____________________
     is pointed to by more than one main PDS directory entry.  This
     type of member is not commonly encountered.

+                            _____________
- Several subcommands allow for specification of a member name group which
  consists of a member name range or member name pattern as follows:

0    Member name range -- a subcommand may process all members in a
+    _________________
     range of members by specifying a beginning partial member
     name, a colon, and an ending partial member name (where either
     or both of the partial names may be null):
        subcommand  :         (all members of the data set)
        subcommand  pt1:      (members from PT1 to the end of the directory)
        subcommand  :pt2      (members from X'00' through PT299999)
        subcommand  pt3:pt4   (members from PT3 through PT499999)

0    Member name pattern -- a subcommand may process all members whose
+    ___________________
     names contain pattern character segments by specifying a member
     name segment, a slash, and another member name segment (either,
     but not both, of the member name segments may be null):
        subcommand  sg1/      (all member names containing SG1)
        subcommand  /sg2      (all member names containing SG2)
        subcommand  sg3/sg4   (all member names containing SG3 and SG4)

0    Member lists -- a subcommand may process those members whose names
+    ____________
     or group names appear in a list of member names:
        subcommand  (aa,bb)   (members AA and BB)
        subcommand  (:bb,cc)  (members from X'00' through BB999999 and CC)
        subcommand  (aa,/dd)  (member AA and all members containing DD)

0    Default member name -- if no member name is specified, the last
+    ___________________
     member name list, member name or member group entered for any
     subcommand which defines member groups will be assumed.

0    Asterisk member name -- if * is entered in the member name position,
+    ____________________
     the last member name list, member name or member group entered for
     any subcommand which defines member groups will be assumed.

0    Member name display subcommands -- MEMBERS, PATTERN and DISPLAY
+    _______________________________
     allow the display of member groups using the above member group
     syntax; however, these subcommands differ as follows:

        DISPLAY -- can not modify the default member group or use lists;
+       _______    _______
                   if no member specification is entered, the entire
                   member directory is displayed.

        PATTERN -- can not modify the default member group or use lists;
+       _______    _______
                   if no member specification is entered, the member
                   group last entered on a PATTERN subcommand is
                   displayed.

        MEMBERS -- can modify the default member group and use lists;
+       _______    ___
                   if no member specification is entered, the default
                   member group is displayed.
1                            ATTENTION HANDLING                          PAGE- 7
+                            __________________
- Several of the line-mode output subcommands such as LIST, MAP and
  HISTORY can produce large volumes of output.  PDS is designed to
  terminate such output when requested via an attention (PA1) key.

  In general, an attention may be used to terminate the current PDS
  subcommand and two attentions in a row may be used to terminate the
  PDS command.


  In the following, the attention processing provided by PDS is
  described in more detail:

     A.  A single attention should terminate any member group in
         progress.

     B.  An attention at a prompt for a data set should terminate PDS.

     C.  An attention at the normal ENTER OPTION subcommand prompt
         should provide another ENTER OPTION prompt; another attention
         at this point should terminate PDS.

     D.  A single attention during subcommand processing should result
         in an ENTER OPTION prompt; the processing action taken at this
         point depends on what is entered next:
          1.  Another attention should terminate the PDS command.
          2.  A null line should cause the interrupted subcommand to
              continue at the point of interruption with the probable
              loss of any buffered output for the terminal.
          3.  An entered subcommand should be given control immediately.
              The remainder of any PDS CLIST in use should be discarded
              as a part of the attention processing.

     E.  If a PDS subcommand is in a loop that does not involve input or
         output to the terminal or input from the current data set, a
         single attention may not terminate the loop:
          1.  The first attention will provide the normal ENTER OPTION
              prompt.
          2.  If a subcommand is entered at this time, PDS may continue
              looping.
          3.  If PDS is looping, another attention should produce the
              message "PDS470W THE PROGRAM IS PROBABLY IN A LOOP" and
              PDS should terminate the executing subcommand and perform
              the subcommand entered at the ENTER OPTION prompt.

     F.  In MEMLIST, if multiple members are selected via the BROWSE or
         EDIT line commands, the remaining line commands on the panel
         can be discarded by pressing the attention key while editing
         or browsing a member.

- Member Protection
+ _________________
0 PDS subcommands such as DELETE, EDIT, FIXPDS, FSE, RENAME, REPLACE,
 'REPRO and TSOEDIT change members which might be in use elsewhere
  in an installation.  To prevent multiple simultaneous updates of a
  member, PDS issues ISPF-style enqueue checks before any of the above
  subcommands first attempt to access a member.

- Data Set Protection
+ ___________________
0'In addition, several PDS subcommands such as ALIAS, ATTRIB, COPY,
 'DELETE, FIXPDS, RENAME, REPRO and RESTORE could cause data set
  integrity problems if they change a data set as it is being updated
  by another user.  This is not a problem if the data set is allocated
  as OLD since exclusive use of the data set is assured.

  To circumvent this problem for SHR allocations, PDS uses the following
  ISPF RESERVE logic to maintain data set integrity during data set
  updates:

     A.  A volume RESERVE is performed.

     B.  If the data set is a load library, then a linkage-editor style
         RESERVE or ENQUEUE is performed as appropriate:
          1.  On a shared DASD volume, a volume RESERVE is performed.
          2.  On a non-shared DASD volume, a ENQUEUE is performed.

     C.  The data set is opened.

     D.  All data set updates are performed.
          1.  For most subcommands with member groups, the data
              set is left open for the entire member group.
          2.  For executions of PDS in batch mode, the volume
              reserve is maintained during the entire use of the
              data set.

     E.  The data set is closed.

     F.  DEQ's are performed to remove the volume RESERVE's and ENQ's.
1                            ISPF INTERFACE                              PAGE- 9
+                            ______________
- PDS is a TSO command processor which becomes an ISPF dialog with any
  of several ISPF interface modes.

-    From READY mode:
+    ________________
     PDS is invoked as a TSO command processor.  When the first
     BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE, MEMLIST or OUTLIST* subcommand or
     the DSNAME or SYSOUT keyword of the CONTROL* subcommand is entered,
     PDS calls an ISPF interface which invokes PDS recursively as an ISPF
     dialog.

     ISPF services are directly invoked for each subsequent BROWSE, EDIT,
     ISPF, ISPMODE or MEMLIST subcommand.

0    From ISPF Version 1, option 6 or the ISPF TSO subcommand:
+    _________________________________________________________
     PDS is invoked as a TSO command processor but ISPF services can
     not be used.
0    From ISPF Version 2, option 6 or the ISPF TSO subcommand:
+    _________________________________________________________
     PDS is invoked as an ISPF dialog and ISPF services can be used
     without restrictions.

0    From another TSO command processor:
+    ___________________________________
     PDS is invoked as a TSO command processor but if an ISPF environment
     has been established by an earlier command processor, ISPF services
     cannot be used.

     Otherwise, when the first BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE, MEMLIST
     or OUTLIST* subcommand or the DSNAME or SYSOUT keyword of the
     CONTROL* subcommand is entered, PDS calls an ISPF interface which
     invokes PDS recursively as an ISPF dialog and ISPF services are
     directly invoked for each subsequent BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE
     or MEMLIST subcommand.

0    From the PDS panel in ISPF:
+    ___________________________
     PDS is invoked as an ISPF dialog.  PDS locates and creates any
     required command processor control blocks and invokes ISPF services
     directly.

0  *Note: the CONTROL and OUTCOPY subcommands do not used ISPF services;
    however, when either is first invoked, it attempts to establish an
    ISPF dialog environment so that ISPF services can be utilized by
    subsequent PDS subcommands.

1                            BACKGROUND EXECUTION                        PAGE-10
+                            ____________________

- Background TMP
+ ______________
0 Since PDS uses PUTLINE, PUTGET and GETLINE MACRO's for terminal
  communication, PDS may be used effectively in background mode for
  processing large data sets as in the following example JOB:

  //JOBNAME  JOB  ...
  //A       EXEC  PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=30
  //SYSTSPRT  DD  SYSOUT=*
  //SYSTSIN   DD  *
   PDS  'SYS1.SMPCDS'
   FIXPDS EXPANDDIR(100)
   VERIFY :
   CHANGE  'SYS1.LINKLIB'
   IF A:Z RMODEANY THEN(MAP)
   END
  //

  When PDS is used in background mode, no prompting for yes or no
  replies is performed; instead, at each decision point, a yes response
  is assumed.

  Note that CONTROL NORECOVER is an initialization default for the
  execution of PDS in the background; if recovery is desired, CONTROL
  RECOVER must be explicitly specified.  PDS subcommands which
  specifically test for ABEND conditions (such as VERIFY with LOAD or
  IF with LOADERR) should not terminate the PDS session.

- TSSO support
+ ____________

  PDS also has support for the Time Sharing Subsystem Option or TSSO
  modification which can be obtained from the MVS SHARE tapes to perform
  TSO functions from a started task.

  When PDS is invoked, if a subcommand is entered (after any requested
  disposition and/or any volume parameter), PDS will execute that single
  subcommand and terminate.

  As an example of a subcommand entered on the command line, consider the
  following example input and system response:

     pds lib.pds60 shr attrib $$/

- Subcommand name abbreviation:
+ _____________________________
  Subcommand names may be abbreviated to the first few characters of the
  subcommand name.  Subcommand names are scanned in the order of the
  output from the OPTIONS subcommand or from an invalid subcommand
  message and the first name match is used.  For example if the invalid
  subcommand, NN, is entered, the following system response would be
  received:

   PDS771E NN IS AN INVALID SUBCOMMAND; ENTER "HELP" OR "OPTIONS" FOR HELP
   SUBCOMMANDS: ATTRIB   ALIAS    BROWSE   CHANGE   COMPARE  COMPRESS CONTROL
 '              COPY     DISPLAY  DIRENTRY DELETE   DSNAME   DSPRINT  EDIT
                END      EXEC     FIND     FIXPDS   FSE      HELP     HISTORY
                IF       ISPF     ISPMODE  LIST     MAP      MEMBERS  MEMLIST

                TSOLIST  USAGE    VERIFY   VPSPRINT

  If the subcommand name A is entered, the ATTRIB subcommand will be
  given control; likewise, if AL is entered, the ALIAS subcommand
  will be given control.

  The set of defined subcommands changes when a sequential data set is
  being processed and in this case, the following system response would
  be received from the invalid subcommand, NN:

   PDS771E NN IS AN INVALID SUBCOMMAND; ENTER "HELP" OR "OPTIONS" FOR HELP
 ' SUBCOMMANDS: BROWSE   CHANGE   COMPARE  CONTROL  COPY     DSNAME   DSPRINT
                EDIT     END      EXEC     FIND     FIXPDS   FSE      HELP

0 Keyword abbreviation:
+ _____________________
  Subcommand keywords may be abbreviated to the first characters
  which make the keyword unique.  For example, HELP LIST SYNTAX
  returns:
     SYNTAX -
          LIST  member NUM/SNUM/NONUM/LBLOCK/LDUMP/BLOCK/DUMP
                       OFFSET(Hx) MODULE(Partm)
                       SKIPREC(n) MAXIN(n) MAXOUT(n)
                       SKIPCOL(n) MAXLEN(n)

  The keyword LDUMP may be abbreviated to LD, LDU or LDUM; the keyword
  OFFSET may be abbreviated as the letter O or any other substring of
  the keyword; and SKIPCOL(42) may be abbreviated as SKIPC(42).
- Partial names:
+ ______________
  Several keyword operands allow partial names to be entered.  As an
  example, see MODULE(Partm) in the syntax of the LIST subcommand.

  Partial names are considered to match an actual name if they match
  for the number of characters entered.  For example, with the LIST
  subcommand, MODULE(ief) matches any name beginning IEF...; however,
  it would not match a name such as IEWL.

  ISPMODE
+ _______
0 The ISPMODE subcommand provides a full screen ISPF session display mode.
  Subcommands entered and the outputs from internal PDS subcommands are
  maintained in a session log.  ISPMODE processing is further extended
  to member list processing with the MEMLIST subcommand.

  If a PDS subcommand produces a output checkpoint (by default 250 lines
  of data), a checkpoint panel will be displayed to allow the user to
  continue or terminate the subcommand.  If the subcommand is terminated
  or completes normally, control is returned to the ISPMODE panel.

  ISPF commands (including PF keys), PDS subcommands and special numeric
  control codes for ISPMODE may be entered to control display processing.

  MEMLIST and ISPMODE dialog table handling is primarily documented in
  the ISPF help panels and in the PDS help member; however, the following
  should be noted:
    1.  Only 79 characters of an output line are retained or displayed.
    2.  ISPF commands RFIND, RCHANGE, LEFT and RIGHT are not supported.
    3.  PDS subcommands END, HELP and TSO are intercepted by ISPF; to use
        these as PDS subcommands, use an alias such as EN, HEL or TS.
    4.  CLIST processing is not supported.
    5.  Output is displayed at the completion of a subcommand or at a
        checkpoint, so output from a subcommand cannot be monitored as
        it is produced.  Thus, if PDS is in a CPU loop, the screen will
        lock up until an attention is entered.  At that time, the
        generated output will be displayed.

  MEMLIST
+ _______
0 The MEMLIST subcommand provides a full screen ISPF member list display and
  manipulation capability by extending ISPMODE concepts.  Subcommands entered
  and their associated outputs are maintained in the ISPMODE session log.

  The current panel display state is called the display mode; the possible
  display modes are defined as follows:
    1.  Non-dialog   - PDS output as before ISPMODE and MEMLIST.
    2.  ISPMODE      - session log display.
    3.  MEMLIST      - any of the four member list displays.
    4.  View         - ISPMODE display for PDS subcommand outputs.
    5.  Line command - ISPMODE display for line command outputs.
    6.  Checkpoint   - ISPMODE display for PDS outputs after each 250
                       (by default) output lines from a single subcommand.

  The ISPF END command should be used to terminate the current display
  mode as follows:
    1.  Non-dialog   - terminates PDS.
    2.  ISPMODE      - terminates PDS if PDS was entered as a dialog;
                       otherwise, reverts to non-dialog mode.
    3.  MEMLIST      - reverts to ISPMODE.
    4.  View         - reverts to MEMLIST.
    5.  Line command - reverts to MEMLIST.
    6.  Checkpoint   - reverts to view mode, line command mode or
                       ISPMODE as appropriate.

  Depending on the display mode, different numeric panel control codes
  are available to control dialog processing:
    0 - Continue the subcommand.
    1 - Suspend ISPMODE (this also deletes any current member list).
    2 - Clear the ISPMODE log.
    3 - Clear the ISPMODE log below the current top line displayed.
    4 - Clear the ISPMODE log above the current top line displayed.
    5 - Cross-check alias members using the current member list.
    6 - Clear any current member list and rebuild it with all members.
    7 - Output the MEMLIST table to SYSOUT or a data set.
    8 - Suspend the member list and switch to view mode.
    9 - Switch to an alternate member list display.
0 Example 1: enter MEMLIST with all members whose names contain PDS70.

+                            __________________________________
0 Since PDS performs EXCP input, it manages its buffers explicitly when
  it cannot use the Read Multiple technique.  To speed the processing
  of a data set for single or double buffering, you could attempt to
  increase the amount of data in each physical record by carefully
  specifying the data set blocksize.

  However, specifying a large blocksize will do little good unless the
  average member size exceeds the chosen blocksize; storage resources
  are actually wasted during input processing of data sets with small
  members and a large blocksize.  The output from a VERIFY subcommand
  can be used to calculate average member sizes of existing data sets.

  In addition, load libraries are resistant to improvement using larger
  blocksizes because each member contains many small blocks along with
  the load module (RLD, ESD, CESD, IDR and SYM blocks).  Only the TEXT
  records would be expanded significantly with the use of a larger
  blocksize.  Note:  a COPYMOD function is available in IEBCOPY to
  reblock load modules in the DFP products.

  For those data sets with larger members, BLKDISK (available from the
  CBT tape, file 296) should be used to determine an optimal blocksize.
  This TSO command is linked with aliases such as BLK3330 and BLK3380 to
  reflect the actual storage devices available at your installation.
  Note: the recommended value from BLKDISK may not be appropriate; be
  sure that you also consider the smaller blocksizes listed.

- This appendix is provided to document PDS program messages.

  PDS messages are of the format PDSnnnx (where nnn is numeric and x
  is the letter I, A, W or E).  The program messages are grouped in
  numeric ranges by message severity as shown below:

       MESSAGE RANGE         DESCRIPTION
       -----------------     -----------
       PDS000I - PDS299I     Informational messages
       PDS300A - PDS399A     Action messages (a response is required)
       PDS400W - PDS599W     Warning message (possible error condition)
       PDS600E - PDS999E     Error messages


  Messages above PDS399 (warning and error messages) can be explained
  via the .? or extended help facility if these messages are received
  during PDS program execution.

  To use the extended help facility after warning and/or error messages
  have been received, enter a .?  response to the ENTER OPTIONS prompt
  message and up to five warning or error message explanations from the
  last subcommand will be requested from the HELP data set by the
  program.


  To have any program messages explained during PDS processing,
  you can also enter a command of the form:
      HELP MSG MSG(PDSxxx,PDSyyy, ...)
           (where PDSxxx and PDSyyy are messages to be explained)

  The actual PDS program messages are not listed or explained in this
  appendix; please refer to the HELP member.  A more readable format
  for the HELP information may be produced by executing the HELPLIST
  program using the PDS HELP member as input.
