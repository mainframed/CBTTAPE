       This series of several installments deals with a tremendously
useful productivity aid, the PDS Program Product, Version 8.0, which
can be found on the CBT mods tape for MVS.  Besides introducing
revolutionary new extensions to IBM's ISPF/PDF, it has capabilities of
pds member manipulation that truly boggle the mind.  It is (literally)
one hundred utilities, or more, rolled into one.  If you spend some
time studying how to install and use PDS, the payback is guaranteed!

       To my knowledge, this series of articles is the first attempt
to create a systematic course of study to guide the reader through the
many PDS SUBCOMMANDS.  It is our aim to provide as full an overview as
possible.  To this end, we have grouped the PDS subcommands into FIVE
SECTIONS, according to their functionality (see Figure 1).

       In our last article, we introduced some of the special concepts
connected with using the PDS product.  We talked about the "CURRENT
DATASET", which is the dataset that PDS is pointing to and acting
upon.  Every time PDS executes, it has to point to a CURRENT DATASET.
The PDS SUBCOMMANDS we talked about last time dealt mostly with
finding (or changing) the attributes of the current dataset as a
whole.  Commands of that type were grouped together in SECTION ONE
of our list of PDS subcommands.

       This month's installment will concentrate on SECTIONS TWO AND
THREE of the PDS subcommands.  We will spend most of the discussion
on how to manipulate MEMBER GROUPS, and we will see how the ISPMODE
enhancements to PDS increase this capability in our hands.  In
addition, we will try and complete our overview of the ISPMODE
features, and to start opening your eyes to the productivity that
they will buy you.

       PDS deals mainly with two types of datasets, partitioned and
sequential.  If the current dataset is partitioned, there is always a
"CURRENT MEMBER GROUP", which is a subset of the members of the
current dataset.  This CURRENT MEMBER GROUP can contain ALL members of
the pds, or it can be a PROPER SUBSET of members, or it can be a NULL
subset.

       Much of the great strength of the PDS program lies in its
ability to manipulate GROUPS OF PDS MEMBERS very delicately.  The
other half of this strength is the LARGE VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS that
can easily be performed on ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP IN ONE
OPERATION.  We will discuss commands to select which members will
comprise a member group at any given time.  We will look at how
PDS commands DEAL WITH GROUPS.  And we will see how ISPMODE OPERATION
OF PDS extends our power with groups very much and very exquisitely.

       To start, we'll have to review a few basic facts about PDS
which were discussed last time.  PDS is a TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR, and
being such, it can operate directly from the READY prompt that TSO
users are familiar with.  You simply enter:
             PDS  'dataset.name'
This will begin execution of PDS and point it to 'dataset.name' as the
CURRENT DATASET.  We talked about the details of how this works in the
last issue.

       PDS can also operate interactively with ISPF/PDF.  This mode
of PDS operation is called ISPMODE.  If ISPF is in the environment of
the TSO session, ISPMODE can be entered using the "ISPMODE" or "ISPM"
subcommand, even though PDS was originally entered in native TSO or
"LINE MODE", without ISPF.  When the ISPMODE subcommand is entered,
the PDS program attempts to use all the datasets allocated for ISPF,
and it invokes itself again as a dialog manager.  PDS can also be
entered in ISPMODE initially through ISPF menus, or directly from TSO
READY through a generation option.  To see how to set these up, please
refer to the installation instructions included in the PDS package.

       What does ISPMODE operation of PDS look like?  We have supplied
a number of sample screens.

       Screen #1 is the introductory screen that is displayed when
ISPMODE is first entered.  All ISPMODE screens consist of two parts,
a "TITLE" part and a "TABLE" or "LOG" part.  The TITLE part, at the
top of the screen, is composed of the fixed prompting information and
the variable DSN line of information, with the CURRENT DATASET name,
its VOLUME, and an indication of the DEFAULT MEMBER GROUP, to the
right of the "MEM=" field.

       Below the TITLE part of the screen is the LOG or TABLE
information which is scrollable, using the usual ISPF commands for
scrolling a member list, plus a few that were added by the authors of
PDS.  Screen #1, which one sees immediately upon entering ISPMODE, has
the same information in the LOG portion as if one entered a "DSN"
command initially.  The results of any new PDS commands entered from
the "command line" appear consecutively in the ISPMODE log, and this
log is positioned to view the last command that was just entered.
This action thus approximates how PDS in line-mode appears to the TSO
user, but the "VIEW LOG" has a complete record of the past actions
that occurred.  It can be SCROLLED and (with Option 7) OUTPUTTED to
SYSOUT or a dataset, or previous commands in the log can be RECALLed
with the "RECALL" OR "R" command.  The capacity of the ISPMODE view
log can be controlled using the "SETLOG" ISPMODE command.

       So we have glimpsed the "VIEW MODE" ISPMODE function.  In
PDS Version 8.0, there are three more ISPMODE functions:  "MEMLIST",
"LISTA", and "LISTV".  These exist in parallel, that is, one can
switch within ISPMODE from one function to another through special
control codes from the "prompt" part of the screen.  The four functions
exist internally to the session as four separate ISPF tables which
are maintained by the PDS program.  PDS, at the 8.0 level, is cleverly
constructed so that the user can dynamically keep track of these four
sessions.

       How is this done?  Enter the "SETML" command from an ISPMODE
screen.  There will appear a special screen, part of which is
displayed as Screen #9.  Answer YES to "Function prompt" and exit the
screen with PF3.  A new screen will appear; this is illustrated as
Screen #10, the "FUNCTION PROMPT" screen.  On that screen, the four
ISPMODE functions in the session can be tracked.  The user can go in
to any one of the modes by entering an appropriate command.  For
convenience, one may want to skip this prompt screen during his
everyday work.  To do so, just enter the SETML command and answer NO
to "Function prompt".

       An explanation of "HIERARCHICAL PANELS" is in order at this
point, and then we'll go on to the other ISPMODE functions.

       The previous level of PDS, Version 7.3, did not have the four
ISPMODE functions arranged in parallel, as does Version 8.0.  The two
functions LISTA and LISTV were add-ons from what existed in previous
levels of the product.  Also, in Version 7.3, the ISPF internal
processing involved in managing the tables was different.  The
resulting structure was such, that one had to get into VIEW MODE first.
Even if he entered a prompt to get into MEMLIST mode first, he would
always go back into VIEW MODE before exiting from PDS altogether.  The
other two functions LISTA and LISTV could never be entered directly,
but only from either VIEW MODE or MEMLIST mode.  Thus the hierarchy.
VIEW MODE always came first, then MEMLIST mode, then the other two,
LISTA or LISTV.  In Version 8.0, there is still the option of keeping
this kind of relation between modes.  Just answer YES in the SETML
screen to the question about hierarchical panels.

       Now to MEMLIST.  MEMLIST is what the name implies, a list of
members of the current dataset, if it is partitioned.  The list of
members DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A COMPLETE LIST, as in ISPF (versions 2.2
and below).  An important question is:  "Which members are listed?"
This will be dealt with later.  For now, and for simplicity, lets
assume that all the members are listed.  First we want to know what
MEMLIST will do for us.

       Look at Screen #2 and Screen #4.  The first thing you'll
probably notice is that MEMLIST displays as much useful information
for a LOAD MODULE pds as for a SOURCE-TYPE pds.  At a glance, in neat
table form, one can look at groups of members and see what they're
really like.  It doesn't end there.  The alternate screens #3 and #5
show even more stats for the same members.  For load modules, the
third alternate, Screen #6, shows the information from screens #4 and
#5 TOGETHER, so one can glance at all the attributes of particular
modules at once.  Option "9" in MEMLIST screens toggles between
these alternate displays.  The added convenience of OUTPUTTING the
entire MEMLIST log with option "7" is extremely attractive if one
wants to see stats for entire libraries or subgroups of members.

       That isn't really the main purpose of MEMLIST.  Although they
are great, the statistics displays are very secondary when you look at
MEMLIST as a whole.  Its real clout is its ability to give UPWARDS OF
20 SEPARATE FUNCTIONS FROM THE SAME MENU, plus THE ABILITY TO CHANGE
LIBRARIES VERY QUICKLY.

       ISPF/PDF doesn't offer that, even in the latest releases,
although it's come a bit closer lately.  In regular ISPF as shipped
from IBM, if you want to edit a source member, you have to get into
the "EDIT" option first.  If you want to browse the same member, you
have to GET OUT of the EDIT OPTION and GO INTO the "BROWSE" option.
Then, more often then not, you have to choose the name of the member
a second time.  If you want to RENAME or DELETE the member, it's the
same pain in the neck over again--you have to get out of BROWSE
and go into UTILITIES option 3.1.  Even the new Option 3.4 doesn't
eliminate this hassle, although it saves some of the work involved.
With PDS MEMLIST, ALL OF THIS AND MORE, IS DONE WITH THE SAME MEMBER
LIST.  Enter a "B" next to the member and you "browse" it.  Enter "E"
or "S", and you SPFEDIT it.  Enter "REN" and you have the option to
rename the member.  Enter "DEL" or "SC" or "SCR" and you delete the
member.

       There are fifteen-or-so other things one can do from a
MEMLIST screen.  Enter "O" next to a member name, and one gets a
panel of OPTIONS available from there.  Enter "O" from the command
line, and there appears another panel of options for manipulating
members and the dataset itself.

       We have to go on.  LISTA or "LA", the third ISPMODE function,
shows the datasets allocated to the TSO session, by DDNAME.  "LISTA"
is much better than IBM's LISTA TSO command.  LISTA is not merely a
list.  One can DO things from the list.  For example, to free a ddname
allocation, type "FREE" or "F" in the command area next to the ddname.
To change the "current dataset" for the PDS session to one of the
other allocated datasets, merely enter "C" next to that dataset name
on the LISTA screen.  There is also an alternate screen to toggle into
by entering "9".  This shows additional info about the allocated
datasets.

       LISTV or "LV", the fourth ISPMODE function, is a table of
mounted disk volumes.  One must enter an operand with the LV command.
Enter LV followed by a partial name.  A list appears with stats
of mounted disk volumes whose names begin with those characters.  The
stats are very good (see Screen #8 in the illustrations).  LISTV
accepts generic volume names.  One must add the keyword "GENERIC".
Upon entering:  LV SYSDA GENERIC, all mounted volumes in the SYSDA
group are shown.  The screen is set up so that upon pressing your
"HELP" PFKEY (usually PF1) from the LISTV screen, you can get help on
the possible options.  If there is a TSO command with the name "VTOC"
installed on your system, (see file 300 of the CBT tape) you get a
vtoc list upon entering "VTOC" in the command slot next to the volume
name.  These facilities can come in handy.  Remember that all the
lists can be OUTPUTTED with option "7".

       (PDS 8.1 note:  The "line command" facility for both LISTA and
LISTV is greatly expanded in Version 8.1 of PDS.)

       This cursory discussion of the four ISPMODE functions will have
to suffice for now.  We turn our attention to the several concepts of
MEMBER GROUPS that are connected with the PDS product.

       Member subgroups account for much of the heart and power of PDS.
In its old form, the attractiveness of PDS was in the variety of its
utility functions operating on members.  This has grown to bulldozer
power in the current product, when all these abilities can be thrown
on tens, or hundreds of members at once.  When one sees the delicacy
with which the groups can be handled, increased, decreased, trimmed,
adjusted--the possibilities truly confound the imagination.

       Basic member manipulation rests on two subcommands, "MEMBERS"
(or "MEM"), and "SUBLIST" (or "SUBL").  These are the rock-bottom
elementary commands that define subgroups of pds members.  There is
a basic difference between them.  Once one understands this difference,
it is easy to follow the workings of the other subcommands that affect
the default, or current MEMBER GROUP.

       Yes, yes.  Not only do we have a CURRENT DATASET, we also have
a CURRENT MEMBER GROUP, which stays with us in our session as long as
the current dataset is partitioned.  If we change the current dataset
with a CHANGE command, as a rule the CURRENT MEMBER GROUP REMAINS THE
SAME.  The current member group changes only if a SUBCOMMAND that
changes it is issued, not if the current dataset is changed.  Now we
are in a position to understand why MEMBERS is different from SUBLIST.

       Groups are initially defined by means of RULES.  We can either
use RANGES of member names, such as "A:C", all members beginning with
letters A thru C.  Or we can use PATTERNS of member names, such as
"ABC/", which specifies that all members containing the string "ABC"
anywhere in the member name, will qualify.  We can use combinations of
the above rules to define a subgroup.  See the special PDS HELP entry
called HELP GROUP, for details.

       If one used the MEMBERS command to initially define the
subgroup, the DEFINITION STAYS AS A RULE.  For example, if one
entered "MEMBERS A:C", the default member group is characterized as
"A:C", NOT as a LIST of members, but merely as A:C.  Upon looking at
the "MEM= " field of the PDS header display, one will see the RULE
DEFINING THE GROUP displayed there if the MEMBERS command was used.
Now if a CHANGE command is issued to change to another current
dataset, the RULE still is displayed, but in this new dataset, a
different LIST OF MEMBERS will qualify as satisfying the rule.

       All this is NOT true if "SUBLIST A:C" was the command first
issued.  In that case, the rules are immediately compared to the list
of members in the current dataset, and a SUBGROUP LIST OF MEMBER NAMES
is generated.  THIS LIST OF NAMES, and not the original rule defining
them, remains as the default member subgroup.  The first NAME in the
list, and NOT the defining rule, will now appear in the "MEM=( " field
of the PDS header display, and an open-paren "(" will be included in
the "MEM=" field.  If the current dataset is now changed, the OLD LIST
OF NAMES WILL REMAIN as the subgroup list, EVEN IF NO SUCH MEMBERS
EXIST in the new current dataset.  The default group now is the LIST,
not the RULES.  There it is in a nutshell.

       We have now learned how to set the member group that we want.
But how do we specify a member group when issuing a PDS subcommand?

       The asterisk "*" is the member group designation character.
Remember that PDS subcommands are issued in the format:
            SUBCOMMAND  MEMBERS  PARAMETERS
where the "MEMBERS" field designates WHICH MEMBERS ARE OPERATED UPON.
(This field is omitted if the current dataset is not partitioned.)
The "members" field can be a range or a pattern, an individual member,
a colon ":" for ALL MEMBERS, or an asterisk "*" for all the members
in the CURRENT SUBGROUP.  By using the asterisk to denote the current
member group in a PDS subcommand, WE CAN PERFORM OPERATIONS ON ALL
MEMBERS IN THE ENTIRE GROUP AT ONCE.  This capability gives the PDS
product much of its power.

       Now we'll discuss more commands which can create the current
member group.  These are "MEMLIST", "IF", and "FIND".

       The "MEMLIST" or "ML" subcommand operates in ISPMODE only, and
causes the session to enter the MEMLIST function and display a member
list.  You may specify which members you want to display, by entering
a range or pattern, or a colon, or an asterisk after the subcommand.
The default is to display the members in the CURRENT MEMBER GROUP.

       Be it known that the LIST OF MEMBERS displayed by MEMLIST is
stored by the PDS program in a table, known as the MEMLIST TABLE.
This table is DIFFERENT from the table which stores the members in
the current group, if the group is defined by a list.  That table is
known as the SUBLIST TABLE.

       When the MEMLIST subcommand is first invoked, the default is to
set the memlist table EQUAL to the sublist table.  You can always
reset the memlist table equal to the sublist table by issuing the
command:  MEMLIST * RESET.

       When you issue another MEMLIST command after the first one, PDS
acts to MERGE the NEW member list generated by the second MEMLIST
command with the member list already in the memlist table. The MEMLIST
TABLE keeps on growing larger, unless the RESET parameter is issued
with an "ML" invocation.  However, EVERY MEMLIST COMMAND INVOCATION
RESETS THE SUBLIST TABLE (and consequently the current group) to
contain ONLY those members from THAT MEMLIST COMMAND, wiping out what
was there before.

       For instance, if you would say:  "ML A:A" followed by "ML C:E",
the MEMLIST TABLE would contain all members starting with the letters
A, C, D, and E.  The SUBLIST TABLE would contain ONLY the members
starting with C, D, and E, as specified by the LAST MEMLIST COMMAND
issued.  However, we can only perform operations on all members of the
current group if they are in the SUBLIST TABLE.  Therefore we need
some command to MAKE THE SUBLIST TABLE EQUAL TO THE MEMLIST TABLE.
This command is:  "SUBLIST = MEMLIST" which cannot be abbreviated.
To make its use easier, so you don't have to type the whole thing, you
can enter option "4" from an ISPMODE screen to get the same effect.

       In brief:  "ML * RESET"  makes the MEMLIST TABLE EQUAL TO THE
CURRENT SUBLIST TABLE.  "SUBLIST = MEMLIST" or ISPMODE option "4"
makes the SUBLIST TABLE EQUAL TO THE CURRENT MEMLIST TABLE, so the
group of members in the MEMLIST TABLE can be made into the current
subgroup.  Once the CURRENT SUBGROUP is made EQUAL TO THE MEMLIST,
then ALL THE MEMBERS IN THE MEMLIST TABLE can be operated upon by PDS
subcommands in one shot.

       All of this means that you can CREATE A CURRENT SUBGROUP from
the MEMLIST members, using option "4".  MEMLIST has one more trick up
its sleeve.  If you enter an "X" next to a member in a MEMLIST, the
member gets EXCLUDED from the MEMLIST TABLE.  By entering option "4",
we then exclude that member individually from the CURRENT SUBGROUP, so
it will NOT be acted upon when we perform a subsequent group operation.
Thus, we have CONTROL OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS in designating the members
of the current subgroup.  This shows the power of MEMLIST in
fine-tuning group PDS operations.

       The "IF" subcommand.  This is another super power-packed
tool.  It is one of the unbelievably powerful things included in
this incredible package.  The "IF" subcommand allows selection of
a member subgroup, followed by an action of another PDS
subcommand, designated by a THEN keyword parameter.  The format is:
    IF memgroup criterion THEN(subcommand) ELSE(subcommand).
If we look at the PDS HELP entry for the IF subcommand, we can only
gape in wonderment at the huge number of criteria we have. We can pick
only those members created or changed most recently.  Or we can select
only those load modules linkedited within a certain time interval.
The selection of possibilities is enormous and mind-boggling.  The
time and effort that this can save a person can only be appreciated by
personal experience and practice with the "IF" subcommand.

       "FIND".  This is a global command that acts on all members of
a group.  Its power is enormous.  The "FIND" subcommand can be used on
load module libraries as well as source-type libraries, to find all
occurrences of any character string, in all the members.  Just thinking
about this a bit will blow your mind with possibilities.  I use FIND
to scan SYS1.LPALIB to figure out which modules can issue a certain
system message.  There are many far-out and hitherto undreamed of
applications of this subcommand.

       The FIND subcommand also has the THEN-ELSE capability.
Full format is similar to that of the IF subcommand.  It is:
FIND memgroup /string/ THEN(subcommand) ELSE(subcommand).
The default action of the FIND command is to display all occurrences
of the string in a beautiful display, member by member.  FIND can be
used for other purposes, however, such as to pick out all members
from a large library which contain a certain string, or all load
modules which contain a company's logo, for instance.  This is
accomplished by a command of the form:  FIND : /string/ THEN(SUBLIST).
The current member group is reset to include only those members
containing the specified character string.  Again, we have only
begun to scratch the surface.  A referral to the HELP member should
start to set the creativity a-flowing.

       Finally, if you can FIND a string, then you can REPLACE the
string also, or so you would think.  In PDS you CAN do this.  The
REPLACE subcommand changes the found string for a different string,
globally in the partitioned dataset, over the ENTIRE MEMBER GROUP
that has been specified.  It even works for load modules and other
RECFM=U datasets, although for those, there is no capability of
replacing a string with one of different length (an obvious safety
measure for load modules).  REPLACE allows for trial runs before
doing the rewrites, to make sure it will accomplish the desired
result.

       Full format of the REPLACE command is:
REPLACE memgroup /from string/to string /  |WRITE|.  If "WRITE" or "W"
is specified, the replace operation will actually be performed and the
data blocks rewritten.  The resulting display will mention this fact.
If the WRITE keyword is omitted, then there will be a trial run and
a display only.  Mighty powerful stuff.

       In this installment, we have learned about the powerful
PDS features of ISPMODE and member group control.  In the next and
final phase of this introduction to PDS, we will examine the many
subcommands in the PDS product that are available to manipulate
the dataset members themselves.
