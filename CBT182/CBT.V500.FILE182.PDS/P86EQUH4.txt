   The REEQUAL  clist provides for setting or resetting processing options
   for the EQUAL  macro.  This clist can be called before or between
   Edit sessions that use the EQUAL  macro.  If the EQUAL  processing
   options are setup for no prompting and the EQUAL  macro is being used
   as a initial macro, the RESET option of this CLIST can be used to
   force prompting at the next Edit session.  If no options are used, the
   REEQUAL  clist will display the EQUAL  processing options panel.

   The REEQUAL  clist can be called with the following options:
   R/RESET - to force prompting if EQUAL  is used as an initial macro.
             no other processing is done with this request.
   H/HELP  - to display TUTORIAL panels.
   P/PROMPT - prompt panel for the above options.
