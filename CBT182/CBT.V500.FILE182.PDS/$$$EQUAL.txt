        THE EQUAL EDIT MACRO AND REEQUAL CLIST

 THE EQUAL MACRO PROVIDES FOR SETTING UP AND EXECUTING EDIT FINDS AND
 CHANGES.  THE FIND/CHANGE OPTIONS ARE SAVED FOR REUSE IN LATER
 EDITS.  IF THE FIND/CHANGE OPTIONS ARE INVALID OR CAN NOT BE
 SERVICED, THE USER CAN REINVOKE EQUAL TO CORRECT OR CONTINUE THE
 REQUEST.
 THIS MACRO CAN BE USED AS AN INITIAL MACRO OR CAN BE CALLED DIRECTLY
 BY THE USER.  IF USED AS AN INITIAL MACRO A SET OF OPTIONS CONTROL IF
 AND WHEN PROMPTING IS TO BE PROVIDED.  PROMPTING CAN BE FORCED WITH
 THE RESET OPTION OR BY USING THE REEQUAL TSO CLIST.

 THE EQUAL MACRO CAN BE INVOKED DIRECTLY BY YOU WITH ONE OF THE
 FOLLOWING OPTIONS:
    C/CHANGE - TO OVERRIDE THE PREVIOUSLY SET FIND PROCESSING OPTION
               WITHOUT PROMPTING. THE OVERRIDE IS FOR A SINGLE REQUEST.
    F/FIND - TO OVERRIDE THE PREVIOUSLY SET CHANGE PROCESSING OPTION
               WITHOUT PROMPTING. THE OVERRIDE IS FOR A SINGLE REQUEST.
    N/NOPROMPT - EXECUTE CURRENT OPTIONS WITHOUT PROMPTING.
    R/RESET - TO FORCE PROMPTING IF EQUAL IS USED AS AN INITIAL  MACRO.
              NO OTHER PROCESSING IS DONE WITH THIS REQUEST.
    H/HELP  - TO DISPLAY TUTORIAL PANELS.
    P/PROMPT - PROMPT PANEL FOR THE ABOVE OPTIONS.

 THE OPTION EXCLUDE ALL OF YES WILL DIRECT THE EQUAL MACRO TO FIRST
 EXCLUDE ALL EDIT LINES BEFORE PROCESSING THE FIND OR CHANGE.
 THIS WILL ALLOW THE MATCHED OR CHANGED LINES TO STAND OUT.

 THE EQUAL MACRO WHEN USED IN THE FIND MODE CAN SETUP THE RCHANGE
 EDIT FUNCTION NORMALLY ASSIGNED TO PF6 FOR THE USER.  BY SPECIFYING
 YES TO THIS OPTION AND PROVIDING A CHANGE TO STRING, THE PF5 AND PF6
 KEYS CAN BE USED TO MAKE SELECTED CHANGES.

 WHEN USING THE CHANGE FUNCTION, YOU MAY WANT TO VERIFY THAT CHANGES
 ARE APPROPRIATE.  THE AUTOSAVE OFF PROMPT OPTION WHEN SET TO YES WILL
 PREVENT THE CHANGES FROM TAKING EFFECT IF THE END KEY IS USED BY
 ACCIDENT.  NOTE THAT THIS SETTING MAY BE RETAINED IN THE EDIT PROFILE

 THIS MACRO CAN BE USED FOR PROCESSING A GROUP OF MEMBERS WITHOUT
 INTERVENTION.   IN THIS CASE, NO PROMPTING IS NECESSARY AND THE
 OPTIONS FOR PROMPTING BEFORE ANY ACTION AND DISPLAYING AFTER
 CHANGES CAN BE SET TO NO.  OTHERWISE, SPECIFY YES ON EITHER AS
 NEEDED.  THE PROMPT BEFORE ANY ACTION CAN BE RESET TO YES BY USING
 THE TSO CLIST REEQUAL AT ANY TIME A TSO COMMAND CAN BE ENTERED.

 WHEN USING THE EQUAL MACRO TO PROCESS A GROUP OF MEMBERS WITH
 PROMPTING AND DISPLAYING SET TO NO, SOME ACTION MAY BE NECESSARY
 IF THE EDIT CHANGE HAS AN ERROR.  USE CANCEL TO CONTINUE PROCESSING
 BY SKIPPING THE UPDATING OF MEMBERS WITH CHANGE ERRORS.  USE THE
 OPTION SAVE TO CONTINUE PROCESSING, SAVING THE CHANGES EVEN WITH
 ERRORS.   USE DISPLAY TO HOLD UP PROCESSING WHILE REVIEWING THE
 ERRORS RESULTING FROM THE CHANGE OPERATION.

 THE REEQUAL CLIST PROVIDES FOR SETTING OR RESETTING PROCESSING  OPTIONS
 FOR THE EQUAL MACRO.   THIS CLIST CAN BE CALLED BEFORE OR BETWEEN
 EDIT SESSIONS THAT USE THE EQUAL MACRO.   IF THE EQUAL PROCESSING
 OPTIONS ARE SETUP FOR NO PROMPTING AND THE EQUAL MACRO IS BEING USED
 AS A INITIAL MACRO, THE RESET OPTION OF THIS CLIST CAN BE USED TO
 FORCE PROMPTING AT THE NEXT EDIT SESSION.  IF NO OPTIONS ARE USED, THE
 REEQUAL CLIST WILL DISPLAY THE EQUAL PROCESSING OPTIONS PANEL.

 THE REEQUAL CLIST CAN BE CALLED WITH THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS:
    R/RESET - TO FORCE PROMPTING IF EQUAL IS USED AS AN INITIAL  MACRO.
              NO OTHER PROCESSING IS DONE WITH THIS REQUEST.
    H/HELP  - TO DISPLAY TUTORIAL PANELS.
    P/PROMPT - PROMPT PANEL FOR THE ABOVE OPTIONS.



      INSTALL

      TO INSTALL EQUAL AND REEQUAL THE 10 PANELS MUST BE COPIED
      TO YOUR PANEL LIBRARY AND THE 2 CLISTS MUST BE COPIED
      TO YOUR CLIST LIBRARY. IF YOUR CLIST LIBRARY HAS A
      VARIABLE RECORD FORMAT ISPF 3.3 CAN BE USE TO CONVERT
      FROM THE DISTRIBUTION LIBRARY FIXED FORMAT.

      THE FOLLOWING IEBCOPY STATEMENTS CAN BE USED TO COPY
      THE PANELS USED BY EQUAL AND REEQUAL CLISTS.

         C I=((INPUT,R)),O=ISPPLIB
         S M=P86EQUAG,P86EQUA2,P86EQUA3,P86EQUA4,P86EQUH$
         S M=P86EQUH@,P86EQUH1,P86EQUH2,P86EQUH3,P86EQUH4
