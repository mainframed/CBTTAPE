   commands are available.  Enter a command name to continue.

       %O.F+as a command to enter the FIND assistance panel.

%   2.+ Optionally, you could skip both panels by entering:
       %O.F.SYSRES VOLUME+

%   3.+ From the O command option panel, you can bypass the assistance
        panel.  For example, enter:%F.SYSRES VOLUME+
        to format the subcommand:  %F SYSRES VOLUME+

   HELP data set.  Enter%H+from the%OPTION ===>+line on the O subcommand
   selection panel reached from ISPMODE or MEMLIST.
