//* THIS IS AN ENHANCEMENT (COMBINATION) OF TWO FLAVORS OF THE YALE   *
//* COMPARE PROGRAM. THE FIRST WAS TAKEN FROM FILE 45 OF THE CBT      *
//* TAPE AND WAS MODIFIED FROM THE ORIGINAL BY MR. BRENT TOLMAN.      *
//* THE SECOND SOURCE IS THE VERSION FROM FILE 300 OF THE CBT TAPE    *
//* AND WAS MODIFIED BY MR. BILL GODFREY AND MR. JIM MARSHALL         *
//* ADDITIONAL CODE FROM THE VERSION FROM FILE 296 OF THE CBT TAPE    *
//* HAS BEEN ADDED TO ALLOW THIS VERSION TO ALSO FUNCTION UNDER       *
//* THE PDS COMMAND. FILE 296 IS FROM MR. BRUCE LELAND                *
//*                                                                   *
//* THE INTEND OF THIS COMBINATION IS TO PRODUCE A VERSION THAT       *
//* CAN COMPARE EITHER TWO ENTIRE PDS'S, OR TWO SEQUENTIAL FILES.     *
//* IT IS ALSO DESIRED THAT IT CAN BE INVOKED BY THE 'COMPARE'        *
//* TSO COMMAND WRITTEN BY MR. BILL GODFREY.                          *
//*                                                                   *

//* THE FEATURES IN THIS PROGRAM ARE:                                 *
//*  1. USES THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM LOGIC FOR COMPARING AND RESYNC- *
//*     RONIZATRION.                                                  *
//*  2. SUPPORTS COMPARES OF FULL PDS DATASETS (DON'T SPECIFY A       *
//*     MEMBER NAME TO USE THIS FEATURE).                             *
//*  3. SUPPORTS COMPARES OF TWO SEQUENTIAL DATASETS (EITHER REAL     *
//*     SEQUENTIAL DATASETS OR MEMBERS SPECIFIED IN JCL).             *
//*  4. SUPPORTS RECORD SIZES DIFFERENT FROM 80 BYTES BUT LESS THAN   *
//*     256 BYTES (NOTE IGNORE CARDS MUST BE 80 BYTES LONG)           *
//*  5. CAN BE INVOKED WITH A DDNAME PARAMETER LIST FROM THE          *
//*     THE 'COMPARE' TSO COMMAND (MODIFIED FROM CBT FILE 300).       *
//*  6. ALSO ENCLOSED IS THE NECESSARY PANEL, CLIST, AND SKELETON     *
//*     TO INVOKE IT UNDER ISPF                                       *
//*  7. CODE FROM MR. BRUCE LELAND TO SUPPORT THE PDS COMMAND HAS     *
//*     ALSO BEEN IMPLEMENTED.                                        *
//*                                                                   *

//* SEVERAL CHANGES WERE MADE TO THIS PROGRAM ON 6/10/88 TO BETTER    *
//* SUPPORT ITS USE FROM THE PDS COMMAND PROCESSOR:                   *
//*  1. CHANGES WERE MADE TO ALLOW PDS CHECKPOINT PROCESSING TO       *
//*     TERMINATE THE COMPARISON.                                     *
//*  2. ADDED CODE TO SUPPRESS PAGES CONTAINING ONLY HEADER           *
//*     INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS THAT COMPARE AS EQUAL.                *
//*  3. ADDED CODE TO SUPPRESS OUTPUT LINES IN THE RECAP REPORT       *
//*     FOR MEMBERS THAT COMPARE AS EQUAL.                            *
//*  4. ADDED FREEPOOL INSTRUCTIONS AFTER DCB CLOSE STATEMENTS SO     *
//*     THAT PDS CAN LINK TO THIS ROUTINE WITHOUT LOSING STORAGE.     *
//*  5. ADDED FREEMAIN INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DYNAMIC AREA AND THE      *
//*     MEMBER STORAGE ARRAY.                                         *
//*  6. ADDED OBTAIN MACROS TO GET THE FMT1DSCB FOR THE INPUT AND     *
//*     OUTPUT DATA SETS TO DETERMINE IF SEQUENTIAL OR PARTITIONED    *
//*     COMPARE IS REQUIRED.                                          *

*        WRITTEN BY. BILL GODFREY,  PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION.
*        INSTALLATION. PRC COMPUTER CENTER INC, MCLEAN VA.
*        DATE WRITTEN. MAY 12 1981.
*        DATE UPDATED. SEPTEMBER 17 1981.
*        ATTRIBUTES. RE-ENTRANT.
*        DESCRIPTION.
*         THIS TSO COMMAND INVOKES A COMPARE UTILITY PROGRAM
*         TO COMPARE TWO SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS (OR MEMBERS).
*
*         THE INVOKED UTILITY PROGRAM 'COMPAREB' IS A MODIFIED
*         VERSION OF THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM FROM THE CBT TAPE.
*
*         THE COMMAND CAN OPTIONALLY INVOKE THE IBM UTILITY
*         'IEBCOMPR' OR A ZAPPED IEBCOMPR NAMED 'ZEBCOMPR'.
*         ZEBCOMPR DISPLAYS UNMATCHED RECORDS IN EBCDIC INSTEAD OF HEX.
*
*         THE COMMAND ALLOCATES THE TWO DATA SETS AND PASSES
*         THEIR DDNAMES TO THE UTILITY PROGRAM.
*
*        LOG OF CHANGES.
*         14MAY81 - COMPARE MEMBERNAMES BEFORE ISSUING MSG03.
*         15JUN81 - ZEBCOMPR KEYWORD ADDED.
*         16JUN81 - FULL KEYWORD ADDED.
*         16JUN81 - USERS CAN NOW USE THE NAME 'COMPARE' FOR BOTH
*                   THE TSO COMMAND AND THE BATCH PROGRAM (COMPAREB).
*                   IF A USER EXECUTES COMPARE AS A BATCH PROGRAM
*                   (EXEC PGM=COMPARE) OR FROM THE CALL COMMAND,
*                   THE COMMAND SIMPLY PASSES CONTROL DIRECTLY TO
*                   THE COMPAREB PROGRAM, AS IF THE USER HAD SPECIFIED
*                   EXEC PGM=COMPAREB.  THIS IS USEFUL AT INSTALLATIONS
*                   THAT INSTALLED THE BATCH PROGRAM AS 'COMPARE'
*                   BEFORE THEY HAD THE COMPARE COMMAND, AND DONT WANT
*                   TO MAKE THE USERS CHANGE THEIR EXISTING JCL.
*         17SEP81 - ASM/NOASM KEYWORD ADDED.
*         15OCT86 - CHANGE PROMPTS FOR DATASET NAMES TO INCLUDE OLD
*                   AND NEW. ALSO UPDATED THE HELP WITH ALL THE
*                   OPTIONS.     JIM MARSHALL
*         30MAR88 - ELIMINATE CHECK FOR SEQUENTIAL DS ONLY. COMPAREB
*                   WILL NOW HANDLE FULL PDS SPECIFICATION.
*                          GUY ALBERTELLI.
*         10MAY88 - ADD IN CODE FROM VERSION IN CBT FILE 296 FROM
*                   MR. BRUCE LELAND TO
*                     1. SUPPORT PDS COMMAND
*                     2. USER UNIT SYSALLDA IN MVS
*                     3. ELIMINATE 013-18 IF SPECIFIED MEMBER DOES
*                        NOT EXIST
*                           GUY ALBERTELLI
*         10JUN88 - ADD IN CODE TO PROVIDE A FREEPOOL AFTER DCB CLOSE
*                   TO FREE STORAGE OBTAINED FOR DCB BUFFERS
*                           BRUCE LELAND
*         31NOV92 - ADD IN CODE TO AVOID S013 FOR MISSING MEMBERS
*                   ALSO, ADD CODE TO DEFAULT THE NEW DATA SET MEMBER
*                   NAME IF IT IS LEFT OFF (THIS CAN BE USED TO
*                   COMPARE TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE SAME MODULE).
*                           BRUCE LELAND
*         01OCT09 - WHEN COMPARING ENTIRE PDS DATA SETS (THAT IS,
*                   OLD DATA SET DSORG IS PO AND NO MEMBER NAME IS
*                   SPECIFIED) CHANGE THE TYPORG PARAMETER ON THE
*                   IEBCOMPR/ZEBCOMPR CONTROL STATEMENT FROM 'PS'
*                   TO 'PO' SO IEBCOMPR/ZEBCOMPR DOES NOT CHOKE
*                   ON THE PDS DIRECTORY, BUT COMPARES SAME-NAMED
*                   MEMBERS INCLUDING DIRECTORY ENTRY USERDATA.

*   THIS IS AN ENHANCEMENT (COMBINATION) OF TWO FLAVORS OF THE YALE   *
*   COMPARE PROGRAM. THE FIRST WAS TAKEN FROM FILE 45 OF THE CBT      *
*   TAPE AND WAS MODIFIED FROM THE ORIGINAL BY MR. BRENT TOLMAN.      *
*   THE SECOND SOURCE IS THE VERSION FROM FILE 300 OF THE CBT TAPE    *
*   AND WAS MODIFIED BY MR. BILL GODFREY AND MR. JIM MARSHALL         *
*   ADDITIONAL CODE FROM THE VERSION FROM FILE 296 OF THE CBT TAPE    *
*   HAS BEEN ADDED TO ALLOW THIS VERSION TO ALSO FUNCTION UNDER       *
*   THE PDS COMMAND. FILE 296 IS FROM MR. BRUCE LELAND                *
*                                                                     *
*   THE INTEND OF THIS COMBINATION IS TO PRODUCE A VERSION THAT       *
*   CAN COMPARE EITHER TWO ENTIRE PDS'S, OR TWO SEQUENTIAL FILES.     *
*   IT IS ALSO DESIRED THAT IT CAN BE INVOKED BY THE 'COMPARE'        *
*   TSO COMMAND WRITTEN BY MR. BILL GODFREY.                          *
*                                                                     *

*   THE FEATURES IN THIS PROGRAM ARE:                                 *
*    1. USES THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM LOGIC FOR COMPARING AND RESYNC- *
*       RONIZATRION.                                                  *
*    2. SUPPORTS COMPARES OF FULL PDS DATASETS (DON'T SPECIFY A       *
*       MEMBER NAME TO USE THIS FEATURE).                             *
*    3. SUPPORTS COMPARES OF TWO SEQUENTIAL DATASETS (EITHER REAL     *
*       SEQUENTIAL DATASETS OR MEMBERS SPECIFIED IN JCL).             *
*    4. SUPPORTS RECORD SIZES DIFFERENT FROM 80 BYTES BUT LESS THAN   *

*   SEVERAL CHANGES WERE MADE TO THIS PROGRAM ON 6/10/88 TO BETTER    *
*   SUPPORT ITS USE FROM THE PDS COMMAND PROCESSOR:                   *
*    1. CHANGES WERE MADE TO ALLOW PDS CHECKPOINT PROCESSING TO       *
*       TERMINATE THE COMPARISON.                                     *
*    2. ADDED CODE TO SUPPRESS PAGES CONTAINING ONLY HEADER           *
*       INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS THAT COMPARE AS EQUAL.                *
*    3. ADDED CODE TO SUPPRESS OUTPUT LINES IN THE RECAP REPORT       *
*       FOR MEMBERS THAT COMPARE AS EQUAL.                            *
*    4. ADDED FREEPOOL INSTRUCTIONS AFTER DCB CLOSE STATEMENTS SO     *
*       THAT PDS CAN LINK TO THIS ROUTINE WITHOUT LOSING STORAGE.     *
*    5. ADDED FREEMAIN INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DYNAMIC AREA AND THE      *
*       MEMBER STORAGE ARRAY.                                         *
*                                                                     *

*            OPT2 IS 'MEM', 'DIR', OR 'NAME'; 'NAME' IS THE DEFAULT   *
*                 VALUE.  PRINT=MEM INDICATES THAT IF ONE PDS CONTAINS*
*                 A MEMBER, BUT THE OTHER PDS DOES NOT CONTAIN A MEMBER
*                 WITH THE SAME NAME, THE  ENTIRE MEM WILL BE LISTED. *
*                 PRINT=DIR INDICATES THAT THE COMPARISON OF MEMBERS  *
*                 WON'T TAKE PLACE, BUT THE RECAP RPT WILL BE PRODUCED*
*                 TO SHOW WHICH MEMBERS EXISTS IN EACH PDS.  PRINT=NAME

*          DATA SET CBT1274J   AT LEVEL 002 AS OF 07/20/83
* CHANGED PARM DEFAULT FROM 1000 TO 9999     AXC-CBT
*
*   THIS IS AN ENHANCEMENT TO THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM THAT IS
*   DISTRIBTED AS FILE 226 ON THE CONN. BANK MODS TAPE.  THE PURPOSE
*   OF THE ENHANCEMENT IS TO ALLOW THE COMPARE PROGRAM TO PROCESS
*   TWO PDS FILES RATHER THAN TWO SEQUENTIAL FILES.  THE ORIGINAL
*   PROGRAM HAS BEEN MODIFIED A LITTLE TO ACCOMODATE THE FRONT
*   END PDS PROCESSOR.
*
*
*
*   THE OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF A DETAILED LISTING AND A
*   RECAP REPORT.  THE DETAILED LISTING SHOWS:
*      - THE MEMBER NAME, DATA SET NAME, AND VOL/SER OF EACH MEMBER
*        PROCESSED.
*      - ANY DIFFERENCES THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE MEMBERS.
*      - A COUNT OF UNEQUAL BLOCKS OF DATA AS WELL AS THE RECORD COUNTS
*        FOR EACH MEMBER.
*   THE RECAP LISTING FORMAT IS:
*      OLD MEM=XXXXXXXX PAGE NNNN NEW MEM=YYYYYYYY STATUS
*      THE STATUS MAY BE
*          - EQUAL           BOTH MEMBERS ARE THE SAME
*          - NOT EQUAL       THERE ARE DIFFERENCES
*          - NO MATCH        THE MEMBER EXISTS IN ONLY ONE PDS
*
*   WE USE THE PROGRAM TO COMPARE PARMLIB, PROCLIBS, ETC. FROM ONE
*   CPU TO ANOTHER AND ALSO AS AN AID WHEN INSTALLING NEW SCP RELEASES.

*  07MAY81 - BILL GODFREY, PLANNING RESEARCH CORP.                    *
*   .  CHECK FOR 'IGNORE' DD WITH DEVTYPE AND BYPASS OPEN IF NOT      *
*      FOUND, SO OPEN WILL NOT WTO 'DD STATEMENT MISSING'.            *
*   .  NAME CHANGED TO 'COMPAREB' (SAVING NAME 'COMPARE' FOR A TSO    *
*      COMMAND WHICH WILL INVOKE THIS PROGRAM).                       *
*   .  ACCEPT ALTERNATE DDNAMES FROM INVOKER.                         *
*      DDNAMES ARE IN SAME SLOTS AS IBM UTILITIES.                    *
*   .  USE R11 AS BASE REGISTER INSTEAD OF R13                        *
*   .  CONVERT PARM TO CAPS.                                          *

*   .  PROGRAM CHANGED TO ALLOW RECORDS LONGER THAN 80 BYTES TO       *
*      BE COMPARED.  A GOOD WAY TO COMPARE LOAD MODULES IS TO         *
*      COMPARE HEX DUMPS OF THEM. NOW THIS PROGRAM CAN COMPARE        *
*      PRINT FILES (IF THEY ARE FIXED LENGTH RECORDS).                *
*   .  CHANGE ALL BAL-R10 INSTRUCTIONS TO USE BAL-R14 INSTEAD,        *
*      (AND SAVE R14) SO WE CAN USE R10 FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE.          *
*   .  PUT THE RECORD LENGTH IN R10.                                  *
*   .  CHANGE ALL INSTRUCTIONS THAT USE THE RECORD LENGTH (80)        *
*      OR 2 RECORD LENGTHS (160) TO USE THE VALUE IN REGISTER R10     *
*      INSTEAD, SO THE PROGRAM CAN COMPARE MORE THAN 80 BYTES.        *
*   .  CHANGE MLENGTH FIELD TO A HALFWORD AND USE IT TO HOLD          *
*      A ZERO OR AN EIGHT INSTEAD OF A 79 OR 71.                      *
*   .  FIX S0C9 IN DCB OPEN EXIT, DIVIDING BY LRECL ZERO WHEN         *
*      RECFM IS UNBLOCKED.                                            *

*      SOURCE) UNLESS PARM=ASM IS SPECIFIED.                          *
*   .  FIX PARM FIELD BUG INTRODUCED 07MAY81, PARM=FULL WAS NEVER     *
*      RECOGNIZED AFTER THAT CHANGE.                                  *
*   .  CHECK PARM FIELD FOR 'FULL' OR 'ASM' ANYWHERE IN FIRST 16      *
*      BYTES.                                                         *

*      R1 WAS DESTROYED PRIOR TO PARMX. USE R4 INSTEAD OF R1.         *
*   .  CHANGE R10 TO 256 IF LRECL GREATER THAN 256.                   *
*                                                                     *
*   NOTE: THIS PROGRAM WORKS CORRECTLY ONLY ON FIXED LENGTH RECORDS   *
*   FROM 80 TO 256 BYTES LONG. ONLY THE FIRST 80 BYTES OF A RECORD    *
*   ARE LISTED. NO WARNING MESSAGE IS ISSUED FOR RECORDS LONGER THAN  *

*  21NOV91 - GREG PRICE (GP@P6)                                       *
*   .  HANDLE LRECL LESS THAN 80                                      *
*      - NEVER MOVE MORE THAN LRECL BYTES TO PRINT LINE BUFFER        *
*      - FORCE 'FULL' IF LRECL IS NOT GREATER THAN 8                  *
*  30MAR92 - GREG PRICE (GP)                                          *
*   .  CORRECTLY DETECT TYPE=ASM, DO NOT CORRUPT PARM LENGTH REG R2   *
*   .  ADD ROUTCDE=(11) TO ALL WTOS EXCEPT ONE WHICH ALREADY HAD IT   *
*   .  PUT TIME AND JULIAN DATE IN PAGE HEADING LINE                  *
*   .  COMPARE WHOLE RECORD EVEN IF MORE THAN 256 BYTES LONG          *
*   .  HANDLE UNDEFINED AND VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS                   *

*   THIS IS AN ENHANCEMENT (COMBINATION) OF TWO FLAVORS OF THE YALE   *
*   COMPARE PROGRAM. THE FIRST WAS TAKEN FROM FILE 45 OF THE CBT      *
*   TAPE AND WAS MODIFIED FROM THE ORIGINAL BY MR. BRENT TOLMAN.      *
*   THE SECOND SOURCE IS THE VERSION FROM FILE 300 OF THE CBT TAPE    *
*   AND WAS MODIFIED BY MR. BILL GODFREY AND MR. JIM MARSHALL         *
*   ADDITIONAL CODE FROM THE VERSION FROM FILE 296 OF THE CBT TAPE    *
*   HAS BEEN ADDED TO ALLOW THIS VERSION TO ALSO FUNCTION UNDER       *
*   THE PDS COMMAND. FILE 296 IS FROM MR. BRUCE LELAND                *

*   THE INTEND OF THIS COMBINATION IS TO PRODUCE A VERSION THAT       *
*   CAN COMPARE EITHER TWO ENTIRE PDS'S, OR TWO SEQUENTIAL FILES.     *
*   IT IS ALSO DESIRED THAT IT CAN BE INVOKED BY THE 'COMPARE'        *

*   SEVERAL CHANGES WERE MADE TO THIS PROGRAM ON 6/10/88 TO BETTER    *
*   SUPPORT ITS USE FROM THE PDS COMMAND PROCESSOR:                   *
*    1. CHANGES WERE MADE TO ALLOW PDS CHECKPOINT PROCESSING TO       *
*       TERMINATE THE COMPARISON.                                     *
*    2. ADDED CODE TO SUPPRESS PAGES CONTAINING ONLY HEADER           *
*       INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS THAT COMPARE AS EQUAL.                *
*    3. ADDED CODE TO SUPPRESS OUTPUT LINES IN THE RECAP REPORT       *
*       FOR MEMBERS THAT COMPARE AS EQUAL.                            *
*    4. ADDED FREEPOOL INSTRUCTIONS AFTER DCB CLOSE STATEMENTS SO     *
*       THAT PDS CAN LINK TO THIS ROUTINE WITHOUT LOSING STORAGE.     *
*    5. ADDED FREEMAIN INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DYNAMIC AREA AND THE      *
*       MEMBER STORAGE ARRAY.                                         *
*                                                                     *

*   THE PROGRAM IS SELF CONTAINED;  SIMPLY ASSEMBLE AND LINK          *
*   AND ITS READY TO USE.                                             *
*                                                                     *

*       5) //OLD      DD  DSN=PDS2,DISP=SHR                           *
*       6) //IGNORE   DD  *      OPTIONAL                             *
*                                                                     *
*   WHERE    NNNN IS 3 OR 4 NUMERICS INDICATING AN ESTIMATE OF HOW    *
*                 MANY MEMBERS EXIST IN THE PDS WITH THE MOST MEMBERS.*
*                 THE DEFAULT VALUE IS 9999.  IF A VALUE OF LESS THAN *
*                 100 IS SUPPLIED, THE PROGRAM WILL CHANGE THE VALUE  *
*                 TO 100.  IF THERE ARE MORE MEMBERS THAN INDICATED   *
*                 BY THE SIZE PARAMETER, THE PROGRAM MAY ABEND.       *
*                                                                     *
*            OPT1 IS EITHER 'FULL', 'ASM', OR NOT SPECIFIED (THE      *
*                 DEFAULT). ACTUALLY, IF THE USER PROVIDES ANY VALUE  *
*                 OTHER THAN 'FULL', OR 'ASM' THEN THE DEFAULT WILL BE*
*                 ASSUMED.                                            *
*                 -TYPE=FULL INDICATES THAT ALL 80 COLS OF THE CARD   *
*                  IMAGE PDS WILL BE USED IN THE COMPARISON.          *
*                 -TYPE=ASM INDICATES THAT COLS 1-72 OF THE CARD      *
*                  IMAGE PDS WILL BE USED IN THE COMPARISON AND THE   *
*                  DEFAULT IGNORE ASSEMBLER DATA WILL BE USED.        *
*                 -IF NOT SPECIFIED ONLY COLS 1-72 WILL BE COMPARED,  *
*                  AND NO DEFAULT IGNORE DATA WILL BE USED.           *
*                                                                     *
*            OPT2 IS 'MEM', 'DIR', OR 'NAME'; 'NAME' IS THE DEFAULT   *
*                 VALUE.  PRINT=MEM INDICATES THAT IF ONE PDS CONTAINS*
*                 A MEMBER, BUT THE OTHER PDS DOES NOT CONTAIN A MEMBER
*                 WITH THE SAME NAME, THE  ENTIRE MEM WILL BE LISTED. *
*                 PRINT=DIR INDICATES THAT THE COMPARISON OF MEMBERS  *
*                 WON'T TAKE PLACE, BUT THE RECAP RPT WILL BE PRODUCED*
*                 TO SHOW WHICH MEMBERS EXISTS IN EACH PDS.  PRINT=NAME
*                 INDICATES THAT UNMATCHED MEMBERS WILL NOT BE PRINTED*
*                 IN THEIR ENTIRITY, HOWEVER, THEY WILL BE FLAGGED AS *
*                 UNMATCHED ON THE RECAP REPORT.                      *
*                                                                     *
*     THE 'NEW' AND 'OLD' DD STATEMENTS SHOULD BOTH POINT TO EITHER   *
*     PDS DATASETS OR SEQUENTIAL DATASETS (OR A MEMBER OF A PDS). IF  *
*     THE DATASET TYPES ARE MISMATCHED THEN THE COMPARISON TERMINATES *
*     WITH A RETURN CODE OF 16.                                       *
*                                                                     *

*          DATA SET CBT1274J   AT LEVEL 002 AS OF 07/20/83
* CHANGED PARM DEFAULT FROM 1000 TO 9999     AXC-CBT
*
*   THIS IS AN ENHANCEMENT TO THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM THAT IS
*   DISTRIBTED AS FILE 226 ON THE CONN. BANK MODS TAPE.  THE PURPOSE
*   OF THE ENHANCEMENT IS TO ALLOW THE COMPARE PROGRAM TO PROCESS
*   TWO PDS FILES RATHER THAN TWO SEQUENTIAL FILES.  THE ORIGINAL
*   PROGRAM HAS BEEN MODIFIED A LITTLE TO ACCOMODATE THE FRONT
*   END PDS PROCESSOR.
*
*
*
*   THE OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF A DETAILED LISTING AND A
*   RECAP REPORT.  THE DETAILED LISTING SHOWS:
*      - THE MEMBER NAME, DATA SET NAME, AND VOL/SER OF EACH MEMBER
*        PROCESSED.
*      - ANY DIFFERENCES THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE MEMBERS.
*      - A COUNT OF UNEQUAL BLOCKS OF DATA AS WELL AS THE RECORD COUNTS
*        FOR EACH MEMBER.
*   THE RECAP LISTING FORMAT IS:
*      OLD MEM=XXXXXXXX PAGE NNNN NEW MEM=YYYYYYYY STATUS
*      THE STATUS MAY BE
*          - EQUAL           BOTH MEMBERS ARE THE SAME
*          - NOT EQUAL       THERE ARE DIFFERENCES
*          - NO MATCH        THE MEMBER EXISTS IN ONLY ONE PDS
*
*   WE USE THE PROGRAM TO COMPARE PARMLIB, PROCLIBS, ETC. FROM ONE
*   CPU TO ANOTHER AND ALSO AS AN AID WHEN INSTALLING NEW SCP RELEASES.

*  07MAY81 - BILL GODFREY, PLANNING RESEARCH CORP.                    *
*   .  CHECK FOR 'IGNORE' DD WITH DEVTYPE AND BYPASS OPEN IF NOT      *
*      FOUND, SO OPEN WILL NOT WTO 'DD STATEMENT MISSING'.            *
*   .  NAME CHANGED TO 'COMPAREB' (SAVING NAME 'COMPARE' FOR A TSO    *
*      COMMAND WHICH WILL INVOKE THIS PROGRAM).                       *
*   .  ACCEPT ALTERNATE DDNAMES FROM INVOKER.                         *
*      DDNAMES ARE IN SAME SLOTS AS IBM UTILITIES.                    *
*   .  USE R11 AS BASE REGISTER INSTEAD OF R13                        *
*   .  CONVERT PARM TO CAPS.                                          *
*   .  CHANGE SYSPRINT LRECL FROM 109 TO 121                          *
*   .  TEST ALL DCB'S FOR SUCCESSFUL OPEN                             *
*  09JUN81 - BILL GODFREY                                             *
*   .  PROGRAM CHANGED TO ALLOW RECORDS LONGER THAN 80 BYTES TO       *
*      BE COMPARED.  A GOOD WAY TO COMPARE LOAD MODULES IS TO         *
*      COMPARE HEX DUMPS OF THEM. NOW THIS PROGRAM CAN COMPARE        *
*      PRINT FILES (IF THEY ARE FIXED LENGTH RECORDS).                *
*   .  CHANGE ALL BAL-R10 INSTRUCTIONS TO USE BAL-R14 INSTEAD,        *
*      (AND SAVE R14) SO WE CAN USE R10 FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE.          *
*   .  PUT THE RECORD LENGTH IN R10.                                  *
*   .  CHANGE ALL INSTRUCTIONS THAT USE THE RECORD LENGTH (80)        *
*      OR 2 RECORD LENGTHS (160) TO USE THE VALUE IN REGISTER R10     *
*      INSTEAD, SO THE PROGRAM CAN COMPARE MORE THAN 80 BYTES.        *
*   .  CHANGE MLENGTH FIELD TO A HALFWORD AND USE IT TO HOLD          *
*      A ZERO OR AN EIGHT INSTEAD OF A 79 OR 71.                      *
*   .  FIX S0C9 IN DCB OPEN EXIT, DIVIDING BY LRECL ZERO WHEN         *
*      RECFM IS UNBLOCKED.                                            *

*      SOURCE) UNLESS PARM=ASM IS SPECIFIED.                          *
*   .  FIX PARM FIELD BUG INTRODUCED 07MAY81, PARM=FULL WAS NEVER     *
*      RECOGNIZED AFTER THAT CHANGE.                                  *
*   .  CHECK PARM FIELD FOR 'FULL' OR 'ASM' ANYWHERE IN FIRST 16      *
*      BYTES.                                                         *

*      R1 WAS DESTROYED PRIOR TO PARMX. USE R4 INSTEAD OF R1.         *
*   .  CHANGE R10 TO 256 IF LRECL GREATER THAN 256.                   *
*                                                                     *
*   NOTE: THIS PROGRAM WORKS CORRECTLY ONLY ON FIXED LENGTH RECORDS   *
*   FROM 80 TO 256 BYTES LONG. ONLY THE FIRST 80 BYTES OF A RECORD    *
*   ARE LISTED. NO WARNING MESSAGE IS ISSUED FOR RECORDS LONGER THAN  *
*   256 OR VARIABLE LENGTH.  ** NO LONGER APPLICABLE -- GP MAR 92 **  *

*  21NOV91 - GREG PRICE (GP@P6)                                       *
*   .  HANDLE LRECL LESS THAN 80                                      *
*      - NEVER MOVE MORE THAN LRECL BYTES TO PRINT LINE BUFFER        *
*      - FORCE 'FULL' IF LRECL IS NOT GREATER THAN 8                  *
*  30MAR92 - GREG PRICE (GP)                                          *
*   .  CORRECTLY DETECT TYPE=ASM, DO NOT CORRUPT PARM LENGTH REG R2   *
*   .  ADD ROUTCDE=(11) TO ALL WTOS EXCEPT ONE WHICH ALREADY HAD IT   *
*   .  PUT TIME AND JULIAN DATE IN PAGE HEADING LINE                  *
*   .  COMPARE WHOLE RECORD EVEN IF MORE THAN 256 BYTES LONG          *
*   .  HANDLE UNDEFINED AND VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS                   *
*  12OCT92 - GREG PRICE (GP@FT)                                       *
*   .  AVOID S0C4 BY SKIPPING IGNORE TEST IF NOT FIXED LENGTH RECORDS *
*  12JUN93 - BRUCE LELAND AS SUGGESTED BY GREG PRICE                  *
*   .  MADE CHANGES TO GETMAIN A VARIABLE AMOUNT OF                   *
*      STORAGE BETWEEN 100K AND 2000K; THEN FREEMAIN 16K              *

 TITLE 'YALE COMPARE     ---  BRUCE LELAND   ---  VERSION 2.0    '
*     CMPRSEQ  CSECT
*
*   THIS COMPARE PROGRAM ORIGINATED AT YALE UNIVERSITY AND WAS OBTAINED
*     FROM THE CONNECTICUT BANK AND TRUST COMPANY MODS TAPE (FILE 226)
*
*   THIS COMPARE PROGRAM USES ONLY COLUMNS ONE THROUGH 72; THUS, ANY
*     TWO VERSIONS OF A PROGRAM MAY BE EASILY COMPARED EVEN IF ONE
*     (OR BOTH) OF THE FILES HAS BEEN RESEQUENCED.  IF NEITHER FILE
*     HAS BEEN RESEQUENCED, A PARM OF "FULL" MAY BE CODED TO REQUEST
*     THAT ALL EIGHTY COLUMNS BE USED IN THE COMPARISON.  A FACILITY
*     IS ALSO PROVIDED TO IGNORE TRIVIAL CARD IMAGES (SUCH AS " EJECT "
*     OR " SPACE 3 " IN AN ASSEMBLER SOURCE PROGRAM).
*
*   THIS PROGRAM USES ALL AVAILABLE CORE IN ITS REGION AFTER OPENING
*     ITS INPUT/OUTPUT FILES (EXCEPT FOR 4K WHICH IS RELEASED).  THE
*     OBTAINED CORE AREA IS USED AS A COMPARE BUFFER WHICH IS ONLY
*     DUMPED (WRITTEN TO SYSPRINT) WHEN IDENTICAL RECORDS (BASED ON
*     THE FIRST 72 BYTES) ARE FOUND IN THE OLD AND NEW DATA SETS.  IF
*     THE COMPARE BUFFER OVERFLOWS, THE PROGRAM TERMINATES.  THEREFORE,
*     IF IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE TWO DATA SETS MAY BE VERY FAR OUT OF
*     SYNC, A LARGE REGION SHOULD BE USED.  THE NUMBER OF UNMATCHED
*     RECORDS THAT CAN BE BUFFERED AT ONE TIME CAN BE CALCULATED FROM
*     THE EXPRESSION:  (REGION SIZE - 8K - BUFFERS) / 160
*     AS A GENERAL RULE, 30K IS SUFFICIENT FOR ABOUT 100 UNMATCHED
*     RECORDS AT A TIME, AND 100K IS SUFFICIENT FOR ABOUT 500 UNMATCHED
*     RECORDS AT A TIME.
*
*   CARD IMAGES OF THE TRIVAL DATA IS INPUT FROM THE IGNORE DDNAME;
*     IF THE DDCARD IS MISSING, A TABLE OF TRIVIAL DATA FOR ASSEMBLER
*     SOURCE CODE WILL BE ASSUMED (THIS INCLUDES " EJECT ", " SPACE   "
*     " SPACE 1 ", " SPACE 2 ", " SPACE 3 " AND BLANK COMMENT CARDS).
*
*
*
*   THE PROGRAM FORMAT ON THE CBT MODS TAPE WAS DISASSEMBLED SOURCE; IT
*     WAS RECOMMENTED, RESYMBOLIZED, REDOCUMENTED AND SLIGHTLY MODIFIED
*     BY  A. BRUCE LELAND (ABL)  OCTOBER, 1978

)F FUNCTION -
  THE COMPARE COMMAND COMPARES TWO DATA SETS.  IT IS A FRONT-END TO
  A BATCH UTILITY TO ENABLE THE COMPARE PROCESS TO BE CARRIED OUT
  IN A TSO SESSION.

  COMPARE INVOKES EITHER THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM (COMPAREB)
           -OR-   THE IBM COMPARE UTILITY PROGRAM (IEBCOMPR).

  COMPAREB CAN COMPARE TWO SEQUENTIAL INPUTS (WHICH MAY BE A
  SEQUENTIAL FILE OR A SINGLE MEMBER FROM A PARTITIONED DATA SET).

  COMPAREB CAN COMPARE TWO PARTITIONED LIBRARIES SO THAT LIKE-NAMED
  MEMBERS ARE COMPARED WHENEVER A MEMBER NAME MATCH OCCURS, AND A
  LISTING OF MEMBER NAME MATCHING DETAILS IS ALSO PRODUCED.

  COMPAREB CAN COMPARE RECORDS OF FIXED, VARIABLE OR UNDEFINED RECORD
  LENGTH.  THE SHORTER OF THE TWO INPUT MAXIMUM RECORD LENGTHS IS
  COMPARED.  FOR VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS, THE RDW (RECORD DESCRIPTOR
  WORD) IS ALSO COMPARED.  FOR UNDEFINED LENGTH RECORDS, A DIFFERENCE
  OF ONLY EXTRA TRAILING NULLS WILL NOT BE DETECTED.  BECAUSE COMPAREB
  COMPARES PHYSICAL BIT PATTERNS, LOAD MODULES AND SPANNED RECORD FILES
  THAT HAVE BEEN REBLOCKED WILL PROBABLY COMPARE AS HAVING SUBSTANTIAL
  DIFFERENCES EVEN THOUGH THEY CONTAIN LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT DATA.

  COMPAREB WILL NOT COMPARE THE LAST EIGHT BYTES OF THE MAXIMUM RECORD
  LENGTH (OFTEN RESERVED FOR SEQUENCE NUMBERS) UNLESS 'FULL' IS
  SPECIFIED.

  (FOR INFORMATION ABOUT INVOKING 'COMPAREB' DIRECTLY WITHOUT THE
  TSO 'COMPARE' COMMAND FRONT END, ENTER
                                         HELP COMPARE O(YALE)
  UNDER TSO.)

)X SYNTAX  -
         COMPARE  'OLD-DSNAME'  'NEW-DSNAME'  IEBCOMPR
             FULL  ASM/NOASM
             OVOL('VOLUME')  OUNIT('UNIT')
             NVOL('VOLUME')  NUNIT('UNIT')
             SYSOUT / PRINT / NOPRINT / OUTFILE('DDNAME')

  REQUIRED - 'OLD DSNAME'   'NEW DSNAME'
  DEFAULTS - THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM (COMPAREB) IS USED.
             PRINT - DISPLAY DIFFERENCES ON TSO TERMINAL.
             ASM   - IGNORE ASSEMBLER SOURCE 'SPACE', 'EJECT'
                     AND BLANK COMMENT CARD IMAGES.
  ALIAS    - NONE
)O OPERANDS -
  'OLD-DSNAME' -  THE NAME OF THE SYSUT1 OR OLD DATA SET.
             A MEMBER NAME MAY BE SPECIFIED IF IT IS PARTITIONED.
  'NEW-DSNAME' -  THE NAME OF THE SYSUT2 OR NEW DATA SET.
             A MEMBER NAME MAY BE SPECIFIED IF IT IS PARTITIONED.
             IF THE DATA SET IS PARTITIONED AND A MEMBER IS NOT
             SPECIFIED, THE MEMBER DEFAULTS TO THE OLD MEMBER NAME.
))FULL     - INCLUDE THE SEQUENCE NUMBERS IN THE COMPARISON.
             IT SHOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE SPECIFIED FOR ANY
             UNDEFINED OR VARIABLE LENGTH RECORD INPUT.
             (COMPAREB ONLY.)
))ASM      - SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPARISON DATA IS ASSEMBLER SOURCE.
             SEQUENCE NUMBERS, 'SPACE', 'EJECT' AND BLANK COMMENT
             CARD IMAGES WILL NOT BE COMPARED.  (COMPAREB ONLY.)
))NOASM    - SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPARISON DATA IS NOT ASSEMBLER
             SOURCE.  (COMPAREB ONLY.)
))IEBCOMPR - THE IBM UTILITY PROGRAM 'IEBCOMPR' IS TO BE USED.
))OVOL     - VOLUME CONTAINING OLD DATA SET.  NOT NEEDED IF CATALOGED.
             IF YOU USE OVOL, YOU SHOULD ALSO USE NVOL EVEN IF THE
             NEW DATA SET IS CATALOGED.
))OUNIT    - UNIT NAME FOR ALLOCATING OLD DATA SET.
             NOT NEEDED IF CATALOGED.
))NVOL     - VOLUME CONTAINING NEW DATA SET.  NOT NEEDED IF CATALOGED.
             IF YOU USE NVOL, YOU SHOULD ALSO USE OVOL EVEN IF THE
             OLD DATA SET IS CATALOGED.
))NUNIT    - UNIT NAME FOR ALLOCATING NEW DATA SET.
             NOT NEEDED IF CATALOGED.
))PRINT    - DIRECTS MESSAGES TO THE TERMINAL.  THIS IS THE DEFAULT.
))NOPRINT  - DIRECTS MESSAGES TO A DUMMY FILE.
))SYSOUT   - DIRECTS MESSAGES TO A SYSOUT DATA SET.
))OUTFILE  - DIRECTS MESSAGES TO THE SPECIFIED DDNAME.

))YALE     - 'YALE' IS NOT AN OPERAND, BUT JUST A HELP ENTRY TO
             DOCUMENT THE 'COMPAREB' BATCH UTILITY.

             'COMPAREB' REQUIRES JCL SIMILAR TO THE FOLLOWING:

             //        EXEC PGM=COMPAREB,REGION=2M,
             //             PARM='SIZE=NNNN,TYPE=OPT1,PRINT=OPT2'
             //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
             //OLD      DD  DSN=YOUR.INPUT1,DISP=SHR
             //NEW      DD  DSN=YOUR.INPUT2,DISP=SHR
             //IGNORE   DD  *            <=== OMIT IF NOT REQUIRED
             IGNORE CARD-IMAGE 1
             ...
             IGNORE CARD-IMAGE N
             /*

    WHERE    NNNN IS 3 OR 4 NUMERICS INDICATING AN ESTIMATE OF HOW
                  MANY MEMBERS EXIST IN THE PDS WITH THE MOST MEMBERS.
                  THE DEFAULT VALUE IS 9999.  IF A VALUE OF LESS THAN
                  100 IS SUPPLIED, THE PROGRAM WILL CHANGE THE VALUE
                  TO 100.  IF THERE ARE MORE MEMBERS THAN INDICATED
                  BY THE SIZE PARAMETER, THE PROGRAM MAY ABEND.

             OPT1 IS EITHER 'FULL', 'ASM', OR NOT SPECIFIED (THE
                  DEFAULT).  ACTUALLY, IF THE USER PROVIDES ANY VALUE
                  OTHER THAN 'FULL', OR 'ASM' THEN THE DEFAULT WILL BE
                  ASSUMED.
                  -TYPE=FULL INDICATES THAT ALL BYTES OF THE INPUT
                   RECORD WILL BE USED IN THE COMPARISON.
                  -TYPE=ASM INDICATES THAT THE DEFAULT IGNORE
                   ASSEMBLER DATA WILL BE USED.
                  -IF NOT SPECIFIED THEN THE LAST EIGHT BYTES OF THE
                   RECORD WILL NOT BE COMPARED, AND NO DEFAULT
                   IGNORE DATA WILL BE USED.
                  -PARM='TYPE=FULL,TYPE=ASM' IS A VALID PARAMETER.

             OPT2 IS 'MEM', 'DIR', OR 'NAME'; 'NAME' IS THE DEFAULT
                  VALUE.  PRINT=MEM INDICATES THAT IF ONE PDS CONTAINS
                  A MEMBER, BUT THE OTHER PDS DOES NOT CONTAIN A MEMBER
                  WITH THE SAME NAME, THE  ENTIRE MEM WILL BE LISTED.
                  PRINT=DIR INDICATES THAT THE COMPARISON OF MEMBERS
                  WON'T TAKE PLACE, BUT THE RECAP RPT WILL BE PRODUCED
                  TO SHOW WHICH MEMBERS EXISTS IN EACH PDS.  PRINT=NAME
                  INDICATES THAT UNMATCHED MEMBERS WILL NOT BE PRINTED
                  IN THEIR ENTIRITY, HOWEVER, THEY WILL BE FLAGGED AS
                  UNMATCHED ON THE RECAP REPORT.

      THE 'NEW' AND 'OLD' DD STATEMENTS SHOULD BOTH POINT TO EITHER
      PDS DATASETS OR SEQUENTIAL DATASETS (OR A MEMBER OF A PDS). IF
      THE DATASET TYPES ARE MISMATCHED THEN THE COMPARISON TERMINATES
      WITH A RETURN CODE OF 16.

 **   NOTE: 'COMPAREB' WILL ONLY SHOW THE FIRST PART OF LONG
 **   RECORDS THAT CAUSE MISMATCHES.

      OBVIOUSLY, THIS INFORMATION CAN BE ADAPTED TO THE TSO ENVIRONMENT
      WHERE 'COMPAREB' CAN BE INVOKED WITH THE TSO 'CALL' COMMAND,
      OR AN INSTALLATION-DEPENDENT LINKLIST-CALL COMMAND SUCH AS
      'INVOKE' OR '$'.
