//*           THIS FILE IS IN IEBUPDTE SYSIN FORMAT AND CONTAINS:   *   FILE 296
//*                                                                 *   FILE 296
//*     DSAT and DSATNEW fixed for 8-character TSO prefixes.        *   FILE 296
//*          (z/OS 2.3)                                             *   FILE 296

//*     DSAT modified further by Andreas Freybier.  Bugs fixed.     *   FILE 296
//*          All branch instructions replaced by Jump instructions. *   FILE 296

//*     DSATNEW renamed by Sam Golob, because of incompatibility    *   FILE 296
//*          with older versions of PDS 8.6.  Newest version        *   FILE 296
//*          PDS86 -- VERSION 8.6.12.13  SEPTEMBER 15, 2011         *   FILE 296
//*          fixes the incompatibility, but if you have an older    *   FILE 296
//*          PDS, this DSAT would cause problems in formatting LC   *   FILE 296
//*          or LISTC or LISTF.  Therefore to keep it separate,     *   FILE 296
//*          I have renamed it to DSATNEW.                          *   FILE 296
