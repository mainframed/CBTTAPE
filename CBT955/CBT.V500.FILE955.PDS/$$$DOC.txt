I - Overview
------------

RMTLOG is a z/OS started task that transmits z/OS console hardcopy
messages to an external RFC 3164/5424 compliant Syslog appliance
or server.  Its purpose is to enhance z/OS security and auditability
by establishing near real time logging to an external syslog server.
Such a remote syslog appliance/server can be any device that is
compliant with RFC 3164 and/or RFC 5424.  Unix and Linux servers
are typically packaged with syslogd or syslog-ng, both of which are
RFC compliant.

RMTLOG also demonstrates useful assembler and z/OS programming
techniques including:
- Access Register programming;
- Extended MCS consoles, including the MSCOPER and MCSOPMSG macros for
  managing consoles and console message units;
- TCPIP sockets programming;
- MVS start/stop interface (Handle START and STOP operator cmds.)

The two principal components required for z/OS remote logging are the
RMTLOG z/OS started task running on z/OS, and the remote Syslog
server compliant with RFC 3164 and/or 5424.

SUPPORT:
No support is provided for this software.  This software is a beta
version, which means that it may have bugs, and has not been fully
tested with all possible configurations and conditions.  While not
required, it would be greatly appreciated if you sent your feedback
to me.

II   How it Works
-----------------
INITIALIZATION:
RMTLOG is an APF authorized started task.  Upon initialization, RMTLOG
establishes itself as a software only extended MCS console, with options
specified to receive the z/OS HARDCOPY message set.  The RMTLOG started
task then sees all hardcopy messages.

The RMTLOG task runs with settings specified in a parameter file that is
allocated to the PARMS DDNAME.  See Appendix B for details on the
parameter file statements.

RMTLOG runs continuously until it is stopped.  It stays in a disabled
wait until it is given something to do:  Either process a new Message
Data Block (syslog message), process a stop or modify command, or send a
message to the remote syslog server.

See Appendix A for the started task JCL and Appendix B for the Parameter
file parameters and format.

THE SYSLOG SERVER:
The syslog server is a server that accepts UDP datagrams or TCP
connections, and writes the payload of these packets to a file as
specified in RFC 3164 and/or RFC 5424.  For more information on the
Syslog protocol (RFC 5424), see http://tools.ietf.or

OPERATION:
The RMTLOG server runs as a started task, and should be started as early
as possible during the IPL process, prior to TCPIP initialization.  In
such a case, RMTLOG will capture and buffer SYSLOG messages while it
waits for TCPIP to initialize.  RMTLOG will deliver those buffered
messages to the remote SYSLOG server once it is reachable via TCPIP.


Start RMTLOG:
To start the RMTLOG task, enter the z/OS console command:
   S RMTLOG

or specify a similar START command in the PARMLIB(COMMNDxx) member, or
in system automation software if used.

Notes when starting RMTLOG before TCPIP is up:
- RMTLOG can be started prior to TCP/IP initialization.  In such a
  case, the RETRYINT and RETRIES parameters in the PARMS member
  should be set to values that allow for an adequate retry period.

- The SIZE and QLIMIT parameters must be large enough to allow
  RMTLOG to queue all the hardcopy messages that are issued before
  TCPIP is initialized, and the remote SYSLOG server can be reached.

Stop RMTLOG:
To stop the RMTLOG task, issue the z/OS STOP command:
   P RMTLOG

Communications or syslog server outages:  If communications disruptions
to the syslog server occur, or if the syslog server itself has an
outage, RMTLOG will continue to queue z/OS messages up to the limits
that are defined by the QLIMIT and SIZE parameters of the PARMS file.
Once communications are restored, the queued messages are sent to the
syslog server.

Priority:
The RMTLOG started task should be given a high enough dispatching
priority to ensure that it continues passing Syslog records, and does
not have console messages backed up.  RMTLOG should not need to be
marked as non-swappable, although this can be d

III   Other Uses
----------------
Log processing tools such as Splunk can be used to view and process log
data from a variety of hosts.  By using RMTLOG to get z/OS syslog
messages onto a Linux or Unix system, tools such as Splunk can easily be
used to examine z/OS messages.


IV   Future Enhancements
------------------------
Some possible future enhancements to RMTLOG include:

1. Allow IP address for Syslog server;

2. Enhance MCS and TCP/IP error handling;

3. Specify multiple Syslog servers for failover.

4. Allow directives in the parameter file to send certain types of
   records to different servers if desired.

5. Allow directives in the parameter file to exclude or include certain
   records based on some kind of pattern matching;

6. Allow dynamic changing of parameters in the PARMS member either by
   allowing changes to be submitted via a MODIFY command, or by
   allowing the PARMS parameter member to be changed and then
   refreshed.

7. Establish ESTAE environment to make RMTLOG more bullet-proof.

8. Optimize the code to reduce the instruction path for each syslog
   record processed.  Currently the data gets copied twice; the program
   would be more efficient if it only moved the data once.


Appendix A   Started PROCEDURE
------------------------------

//RMTLOG PROC
//*--------------------------------------------------------------------
//* RMTLOG - Remote Syslog Task.
//*--------------------------------------------------------------------
//* 05/29/2010 John C. Miller.
//*--------------------------------------------------------------------
//LOGGER   EXEC PGM=RMTLOG,TIME=1440             <=== (1)
//STEPLIB  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.LINKLIB          <=== (2)

//SYSTCPD  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.TCPIP(TCPDATA)   <=== (4)
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*

(1) Execute statement.   TIME=1440 makes this task not time out.

(2) APF authorized link library that contains the RMTLOG module.
    STEPLIB can be omitted if the RMTLOG module is in a linklist LPA
    List library.

(3) LRECL(80) file containing the parameters for RMTLOG.

(4) TCPDATA file, if required for your installation.  May be needed for
    dns name lookup of the remote syslog server, depending on the
    configuration of TCP/IP on z/OS.


Appendix B   Parameter File
---------------------------
The parameter file is an LRECL(80) PDS member that contains settings for
the RMTLOG started task.  The parameters are all space delim meaning
that each line contains a parameter name, followed by one or more
spaces, followed by the value for that parameter.  Lines th begin with
either  #  or  *  in column one are ignored i.e. are treated as
comments.  A sample parameter member is supplied with the RMTLOG package
in member PARMS.

Parameter:  Example:            Description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SERVER      rmtlog.jmit.com     Host name of SYSLOG server.  This should
                                be a partially or fully qualified domain
                                name for the server that will receive
                                the syslog records.  Be sure that the
                                DNS servers specified in the z/OS TCPIP
                                stack are able to resolve this name.

SERVERIP    70.102.3.45         IP address of SYSLOG server.  Note:
                                Note:  SERVERIP or SERVER can be coded,
                                but not both.  An error message will
                                be issued if both SERVER and SERVERIP
                                are coded.

HOSTAME     myhost              Overrides the local host name specified
                                in the active TCPDATA file.  Some syslog
                                servers use this value to affect how
                                logs are handled.

PROTO       TCP                 UDP or TCP Specifies the protocol to use
                                in communicating with the remote SYSLOG
                                server.  If using the older BSD Syslog
                                facility (described by RFC 3164) then
                                only UDP can be specified here, as the
                                BSD Syslog daemon only responds to UDP
                                requests.  See Appendix C Syslog Server
                                for more information on configuring the
                                Syslog server.

PORT        514                 Usually set to 514. UDP or TCP port to
                                which RMTLOG will send Syslog messages.
                                The Syslog Server must be listening on
                                this port for Syslog requests.

CNAME       RLG01               Up to 8 characters.  The name of the
                                Extended MCS console.  Mainly or
                                documentary purposes.  This name can be
                                used with the D EMCS command   e.g.:
                                D EMCS,FULL,CN=RLG01

TIMESRC     MESSAGE             MESSAGE: Takes the time stamp from the
                                z/OS Message Data Block (MDB).  This
                                will result in the remotely logged
                                message having the same time stamp as
                                the original local SYSLOG message.
                                SYSTEM:  Causes the current z/OS system
                                time to be placed in the remotely logged
                                message.

PRI         035                 3 digit number. Default PRI value.  See
                                Appendix C on Syslog Server, and RFC
                                3164 and RFC 5424 for an extensive
                                treatment of the PRI value.  It can be
                                left as its default value of 035 to
                                start with.

RETRYINT    15                  Retry seconds.  If the syslog server
                                cannot be reached, the parameter
                                determines how long to wait (in seconds)
                                before retrying the connection.

RETRIES     0                   How many times to retry before giving
                                up, and issuing a fatal message.  A
                                value of 0 means to never give up
                                retrying, and is the recommended value.

SIZE        512                 Number of megabytes allowed for the
                                messages data space.  Minimum is 1, and
                                maximum is 2048 (2gb)

QLIMIT      524288              Maximum number of MCS messages that can
                                be queued.  Maximum value is 2147483647,
                                (2 billion) which equates to X 7FFFFFFF
                                .

Appendix C   Syslog Server
--------------------------
HARDWARE / OS PLATFORM The remote Syslog server can be any platform that
is capable of running an RFC 3164 or RFC 5424 compliant syslog server.
Most mainst Linux distributions come with a syslog server installed that
is capable of satisfying the requirements for such a server.  Red Hat En
Linux (RHEL) 5.3 was used as the development platform for RMTLOG, and
the sample configurations in this document are what would be us RHEL or
CENTOS Linux.  An Intel based Linux or Solaris server is an inexpensive
but capable platform for hosting the remote Syslog se

SYSLOG SOFTWARE:
Many Linux distributions come with the BSD Syslog facility already
installed.  BSD Syslog only accepts UDP syslog requests, not TCP.  best
results, it is recommended that BSD Syslog be either uninstalled or
disabled, and Syslog-ng (Next Generation) be installed inste Syslog-ng
can be configured to accept either UDP or TCP syslog requests, and TCP
connections offer the benefits of greater reliabilit and proper
sequencing of records even under congested network situations.
Syslog-ng can be downloaded from the Syslog-ng home page a
http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/

An Open Source (free) version of Syslog-ng is available at this site, as
is a  Premium  (i.e. not free) version.  The free version wo fine for
the purposes of RMTLOG.  This site has information on configuring
Syslog-ng, but a sample configuration (such as was used in development
of RMTLOG) is shown below.

SAMPLE SYSLOG-NG  CONFIGURATION FOR USE WITH RMTLOG:

@version: 3.0
#
# Syslog-ng configuration for use with RMTLOG
#
options {
  use_fqdn(no);
  keep_hostname(yes);
  use_dns(no);
  dns_cache(no);
  long_hostnames(off);
  };

#---
# Default source for internal messages.
#---
source s_local {
internal();
unix-stream("/dev/log");
# messages from the kernel
file("/proc/kmsg" program_override("kernel: "));
};

#---
# Default destination for internal messages.
#---
destination d_messages { file("/var/log/messages"); };



#---
# RMTLOG source and destination.  The destination as coded here will res
# in a separate log file for each host that is logged in the directory:
# /var/log/HOSTS/<hostname>.  This can be changed as desired.
#---
source TCP_UDP {
  tcp( port(514));
  udp( port(514));
  };

destination logip {
  file("/var/log/HOSTS/$HOST" perm(0600) create_dirs(no) dir_perm(0700)
  };

#---
# Source and destination connections.
#---
log {
  source(s_local);
  destination(d_messages);
  source(TCP_UDP);
  destination(logip);
  };

RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX (RHEL) 5.X CONFIGURATION
Listening:
If a BSD Syslog server is chosen, then the following changes need to be
made to the RHEL configuration:  In the file /etc/sysconfig/syslog, add
the  -r  flag to SYSLOGD_OPTIONS.  When finished, it should look
something like this:

SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-m 0 -r"

If the Syslog-ng syslog server is installed, the above change is not
needed.  Syslog-ng already listens on both UDP and TCP port 514 TCP
directive in the Source entry in the configuration file.

Firewall:
The firewall must be instructed to allow inbound datagrams / packets on
port 514.  For RHEL5, select GUI as follows:  System / Admini Level and
Firewall.

Click the  Other Ports  arrow, and then click the  Add  button, specify
the port number (e.g. 514) and type (UDP or TCP).  Click OK t

OTHER CONFIGURATION ISSUES:
Log file size and location:  As Syslog data can grow to be quite large,
it is strongly recommended that the Syslog files be mounted on a
separate, dedicated file prevent the Syslog server system from crashing
if the log files become  full.  It is also recommended that the file
system that is to as large as possible to prevent running out of
storage.

Log Rotation:
Use of the logrotate package on Linux platforms is highly recommended.
Logrotate will automatically break up the log file into a siz and
compress these files for maximum space efficiency.  For more
information, Google on  logrotate rhel  for example, if RHEL is the


Network connectivity:
Hosts that are sending Syslog records to the Syslog server should have
robust, high-speed network connectivity to the Syslog server w

Dedication:
It is strongly recommended that the Syslog server be dedicated solely to
recording syslog records from remote hosts.  Other workloads timely
processing of Syslog recording requests.
