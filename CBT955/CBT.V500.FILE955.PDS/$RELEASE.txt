Release Notes:
--------------
09/21/2016 -
Tested and operational on z/OS 2.0 without reassembly.

11/10/2010 -
v1.1
Added SERVERIP parameter to allow specifying syslog server by ipv4
address instead of by domain name.  I am not calling this code beta any
longer, as it has been in production on at least one z/OS system for
over 5 years.  However it would be helpful to have any feedback or bug
reports.

06/20/2010 -
v1.0 (beta)
Original version, developed on z/OS 1.10. I'm calling this a beta
version mainly because it's only been run at a couple of sites.
