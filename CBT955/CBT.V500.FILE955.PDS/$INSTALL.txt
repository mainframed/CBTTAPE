Quick Install Instructions:
---------------------------

1) Modify the ASM member to reflect your local libraries, and run.  The
   job should complete with a condition code of 0.

2) Create and customize a PARMS member.  See the $$$DOC member for more
   information.  A sample PARMS members is included in this PDS.

3) Create a started PROC.  You may need to create a STARTED RACF profile
   for the new started task.  Use member RMTLOG$ in this PDS as an
   example, changing the data set names as appropriate.

4) Configure and start a syslog server as per the $$$DOC member.

5) Start RMTLOG with the command: S RMTLOG

You should see z/OS messages in the log file of the SYSLOG server.

Note:
It does not matter which is started first, the RMTLOG started task,
the remote syslog server, or TCPIP.  If RMTLOG is started first, it
will buffer z/OS syslog messages while it continues retrying the
TCPIP socket init, and while waiting for the remote syslog server to
start responding.


If RMTLOG is started before TCPIP and the remote syslog server, be sure
that the RETRYINT and RETRIES settings are set appropriately in the
PARMS member.
