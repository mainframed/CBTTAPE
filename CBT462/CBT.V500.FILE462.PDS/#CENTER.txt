    This Edit Macro allows a user to center the data in a dataset
    between the specified bounds. The only requirement is for the lines
    you wish centered to be marked by an S line command.


%SYNTAX:+   CENTER
+
+           There are no other operands for this command.
+           The lines you want centered must be designated with
+           an S line command. Use S followed by a number or a block
+           command version (SS SS).
