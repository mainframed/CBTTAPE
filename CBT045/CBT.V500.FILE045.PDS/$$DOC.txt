JES2 SOURCE COMPARE SYSTEM

     ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS PDS IS THE ORIGINAL PDS COMPARE PROGRAM
     CALL PDSCMPR                                           AXC

 DEVELOPED BY:
     BRENT TOLMAN
     TMS
     SALT LAKE CITY
     UTAH 84118

PURPOSE:
     SHOW ALL CHANGE ACTIVITY BETWEEN TWO RELEASES OF JES2 ON THE
     ASSEMBLY LISTINGS.

COMPONENTS:
     PDSCMPR  - ORIGINAL PDS COMPARE PROGRAM
     JES2CMPR - AN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAM THAT IS A MODIFICATION OF
                THE PDSCMPR PROGRAM.  THIS PROGRAM CREATES A PDS THAT
                CONTAINS ALL OF THE CHANGES BETWEEN TWO RELEASES.
     JES2LIST - AN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAM THAT READS THE ABOVE PDS,
                THE SYSPRINT OUTPUT FROM THE ASSEMBLER AND PRINTS A
                NEW ASSEMBLY LISTING SHOWING WERE CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED.
     CMPRPDS  - A JCL STREAM THAT EXECUTES JES2CMPR.
     JES2ASM2 - A PROC THAT EXECUTES THE ASSEMBLER AND THEN JES2LIST TO
                CREATE THE POST ASSEMBLY LISTING
     ASM88888 - A JCL STREAM THAT ASSEMBLES ALL OF THE JES2 MODULES.

NOTES:
   1)  THE SYSTEM ISN'T AS POLISHED AS IT MIGHT BE, BUT IT DOES WORK
       FAIRLY WELL:

           - SINCE BOTH THE OLD CODE AND THE NEW CODE ARE SHOWN IN THE
             POST ASSEMBLY LISTING, A LITTLE CAUTION IS REQUIRED WHEN
             READING THE LISTING TO NOTE WHAT IS COMMENTS AND WHAT IS
             EXECUTED CODE.  THE LISTING CLEARLY FLAGS CHANGES IN THE
             RIGHT HAND MARGIN TO HELP AVOID CONFUSION.  IF DESIRED,
             THE JES2LIST PROGRAM COULD BE MODIFIED SO THE OLD "WAS"
             CODE DOESN'T PRINT.

           - DEPENDING ON HOW THE JES2 CHANGE TEAM SEQUENCES THEIR
             CHANGES, SOME OF THE NEW CODE MAY LIST BOTH AS EXECUTED
             CODE AND AS COMMENTS.  THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE NEW CODE
             HAS A SEQUENCE NUMBER LESS THAN THE OLD CODE.  FOR
             EXAMPLE, IF THE OLD CODE WAS:

                 MVI X,C' '      X00001200
                 MVI Z,C' '      X00001300

             AND THE NEW CODE IS

                 MVI X,C'0'      X00001180
                 MVI Y,C'0'      X00001200
                 MVI Z,C'0'      X00001300

             THE MVI X,C'0'      X00001180 WOULD LIST BOTH AS EXECUTED
             CODE AND AS A COMMENT SAYING "NEW".  THIS WILL BE MUCH MORE
             CLEAR AFTER YOU USE THE SYSTEM.  IT COULD BE CORRECTED BY
             MODIFYING JES2LIST; AT THE PRESENT TIME, JES2LIST READS THE
             OLD CODE CHANGES FIRST AND THEN THE NEW CODE CHANGES.  TO
             FIX THIS PROBLEM, JES2LIST WOULD HAVE TO READ BOTH THE OLD
             AND NEW CODE CHANGES AND THEN PROCESS WHICH EVER ONE HAD
             THE LOWEST SEQUENCE NUMBER FIRST.  AGAIN, IF YOU PAY
             ATTENTION TO THE FLAGS IN THE RIGHT HAND MARGIN, THIS ISN'T
             MUCH OF A PROBLEM.

           - IF THERE ARE NO CHANGES IN A MODULE, THEN JES2LIST WILL GET
             A S013-18 ABEND.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED A NUMBER OF
             WAYS IN THE CODE, BUT HAS SIMPLY BEEN HANDLED WITH JCL; IF
             THE JES2LIST STEP ABENDS, THEN AN "IEBGENER" STEP IS EXECUTED
             TO COPY THE ORIGINAL ASSEMLY LISTING TO A SYSOUT DATA SET.

           - JES2LIST SHOWS MACROS THAT HAVE BEEN CHANGED, BUT DOESN'T TRY TO
             SHOW ANY CHANGES IN THE CODE THAT GETS EXPANDED.
             FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE $#CKPT MACRO HAS CHANGED BETWEEN RELEASE,
             EACH TIME THE  $#CKPT MACRO IS CODED, THERE WILL BE A FLAG IN THE
             MARGIN, BUT THERE WILL BE NO FLAGS TO NOTE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN
             THE CODE THAT THE MACRO GENERATED.

  2) THE SYSTEMS WAS DESIGNED AND IS BEING USED BY TMS TO CLEARLY SHOW JES2
     CHANGES, BUT OBVIOUSLY COULD BE USED FOR ANY APPLICATION WRITTEN
     IN ASSEMBLER.  IT SPECIFICALLY TREATS APPLICATIONS WITH MORE THAN
     ONE MODULE, BUT THERE IS NO REASON IT COULDN'T BE USED WITH INDIVID-
     UAL PROGRAMS.
