//***FILE 185 contains tools to help you control the TSO auth       *   FILE 185

//*           to your TSO session.  Between this file, and File     *   FILE 185

//*           help you in this matter, both in altering the         *   FILE 185
//*           "common storage" copies of the auth tables created    *   FILE 185
//*           by PARMLIB (members IKJTSOxx), and in altering the    *   FILE 185
//*           individual TSO session's auth tables pointed to by    *   FILE 185

//*           File 185 also contains source code (member ASMTABLS)  *   FILE 185

//*           a greatly expanded IKJTABLS load module to authorize  *   FILE 185
//*           programs and commands under TSO.  When run in an APF  *   FILE 185
//*           authorized STEPLIB in a TSO session, this IKJTABLS    *   FILE 185
//*           load module will override IKJTSOxx from PARMLIB and   *   FILE 185
//*           will also override the copies of IKJTEFE2, IKJEFTE8,  *   FILE 185
//*           IKJEFTAP, and IKJEFTNS that are in SYS1.LPALIB.       *   FILE 185

//*           The source code (member ASMTABLS) was created with    *   FILE 185
//*           the aid of the vendor product STARTOOL FDM from       *   FILE 185
//*           Serena, Inc.  I have included a free method of        *   FILE 185

//*           current IKJTABLS load module, using only free tools.  *   FILE 185
//*           This is completely self-contained in XMIT format,     *   FILE 185

//*           in that pds, and member $$NOTE2 in this pds, will     *   FILE 185

//*           The load library is included in this file, in member  *   FILE 185
//*           LOADLIB, in TSO XMIT format.  Just do a TSO RECEIVE   *   FILE 185

//*           If you want to authorize everything that everybody    *   FILE 185

//*           authorization of some programs and/or commands.       *   FILE 185
//*           I have tried to include all the commands that I       *   FILE 185
//*           use, and all the names that I could find on the       *   FILE 185
//*           live systems, but you may most likely need some       *   FILE 185
//*           more.  To quickly obtain a list of programs in your   *   FILE 185
//*           session's auth tables see the LWATMGR and LWATEDIT    *   FILE 185
