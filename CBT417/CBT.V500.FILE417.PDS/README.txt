RACF Administration (RACFADM) makes many security tasks simple.  It
lists user, group, data set, and general resource profiles by means of a
user-friendly, menu-driven interface; it provides interactive
modification of most fields.

Among its features are: connecting groups to a user, adding permissions,
user authorization searching across classes, and displaying the group
from which an authorization is granted.

Written in customizable Rexx, RACFADM includes an exec to automate
creation of aliases or data sets when creating a new TSO user and can
browse all RACF system options from a single, scrollable display.

To begin using execute the RACFADM member found in the EXEC library.
