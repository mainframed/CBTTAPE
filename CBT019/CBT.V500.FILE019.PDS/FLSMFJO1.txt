*        THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN TO FORMAT A REPORT OF SELECTED      *
*        SMF TYPE 30 STEP OR JOB STATISTICS RECORDS.                  *
*                                                                     *
*        IT WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LARGEST          *
*        RESOURCE USERS OF THE SYSTEM.  BY PRODUCING A LIST           *
*        SORTED IN CPUTIME SEQUENCE OR EXCP COUNT SEQUENCE,           *
*        OR TAPE MOUNTS SEQUENCE, THE TOP GROUP OF JOBS IN            *
*        EACH CATAGORY CAN BE DETERMINED.  BY PRODUCING A             *
*        REPORT WITH NODETAIL AND AVERAGES REQUESTED, A               *
*        PROFILE CAN BE DETERMINED FOR THE SELECTED GROUP             *
*        OF JOBS.  THIS PROGRAM WAS USED TO SIGNIFICANTLY             *
*        REDUCE THE CPU RESOURCES OF OUR PRODUCTION BATCH             *
*        JOBS BY POINTING OUT OUR BIGGEST 'HOGS'.                     *

*        DAY OF THE WEEK SELECTION CAN BE MADE ON THE ACCORDING       *
*        TO THE DAY OF THE WEEK ACCORDING TO THE DATE THE STEP        *
*        STARTED OR ENDED.  THE KEYWORD SDAY IS USED TO SPECIFY       *
*        WHICH DAYS WILL BE SELECTED BASED UPON START DATE.           *
*        THE KEYWORD EDAY IS USED FOR SELECTION BASED ON STOP         *

*        THE SDAY OR EDAY STATEMENT OR MULTIPLE STATEMENTS            *
*        CAN BE USED.  IN EITHER CASE, THE SUBPARAMETERS ARE          *

*        "INCLUDE" ONE OR MORE DAYS WHILE OTHERS "EXCLUDE".           *

*        LEAST 1 "INCLUDING" STATEMENT MUST BE USED OR NO DAYS        *

*        IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THROUGH AN INVALID COMBINATION OF        *

*        PARAMETERS ARE PROCESSED IN THE ORDER ENTERED.  FOR          *

*        THIS COMBINATION WOULD LOGICALLY EXCLUDE ALL DATA.           *
*                                                                     *

*        THIS COMBINATION WOULD LOGICALLY EXCLUDE ALL DATA.           *
*        IF ONLY EXCLUDING PARAMETERS ARE ENTERED, NO SELECTION       *
*        CAN OCCUR.  IT IS PROBABLY SAFER TO ONLY USE INCLUDING       *
*        STATEMENTS.                                                  *

*                       SPECIAL DATE/TIME ISSUES                      *
*                                                                     *
*        SELECTION OF DATA BY DATE AND TIME IS, BY NECESSITY,         *
*        A LITTLE CONVOLUTED.  THE SMF DATA FOR THE INFORMATION       *
*        FORMATTED BY THIS UTILITY HAS TWO DIFFERENT DATES AND        *
*        TIMES.  THERE IS THE START DATE AND TIME FOR THE JOB,        *
*        STEP OR INTERVAL.  THERE IS ALSO THE END DATE AND TIME       *
*        THAT IS THE TIME WHEN THE SMF RECORD WAS CREATED.            *
*        BEING ABLE TO SELECT BY EITHER IS DESIRABLE.                 *
*                                                                     *
*        THERE ARE ALSO TWO DIFFERENT DATE AND TIME CONDITIONS        *
*        THAT ARISE:                                                  *
*                                                                     *
*        1)  NEED FOR ALL DATA FOR THE SAME TIME RANGE FOR            *
*            SEVERAL DAYS.  THE EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND            *
*            IS WANTING ALL ACTIVITY FROM 8:00AM TO 5:00PM            *
*            FOR A DATE RANGE.  FOLLOWING IS HOW TO ACCOMPLISH        *
*            THIS:                                                    *
*                                                                     *
*            DATE=2003/07/07:2003/07/11                               *
*            STIME=08.00:17.00                                        *
*                                                                     *
*            THIS WOULD DISPLAY ONLY ACTIVITY THAT STARTED            *
*            DURING PRIME SHIFT ON THE SPECIFIED DATES.               *
*                                                                     *
*        2)  NEED FOR ALL DATA FROM A SPECIFIC TIME ON A              *
*            GIVEN DAY UNTIL A SPECIFIC TIME ON ANOTHER DAY.          *
*            THIS ALLOWS PROCESSING AN INVERVAL THAT CROSSES          *
*            THE MIDNIGHT TIME LINE.  FOLLOWING IS HOW TO             *
*            ACCOMPLISH THIS:                                         *
*                                                                     *
*            DATE=2003/07/09:2003/07/10                               *
*            STIME=11.00                                              *
*            ETIME=13.00                                              *
*            TIMEINCLUSIVE                                            *
*                                                                     *
*            THIS WOULD DISPLAY ALL ACTIVITY FROM 11:00AM ON          *
*            THE FIRST DAY UNTIL 01:00PM ON THE SECOND DAY.           *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
