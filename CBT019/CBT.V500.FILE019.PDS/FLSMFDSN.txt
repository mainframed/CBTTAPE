*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*        MULTIVOLUME DATASETS ARE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE.  THIS IS       *
*        BECAUSE OF THE VARYING WAYS THAT SMF REPORTS THEM.  THE      *
*        ISSUES ARE AS FOLLOWS:                                       *
*                                                                     *
*        1)  MULTIVOLUME SEQUENTIAL FILES HAVE A RECORD WRITTEN       *
*            FOR EACH VOLUME OF THE DATASET AS END-OF-VOLUME OR       *
*            END-OF-FILE IS REACHED.  THIS ALLOWS THE BLOCK           *
*            COUNTS TO BE DISPLAYED FOR EACH VOLUME. SINCE            *
*            EACH VOLUME WILL PRODUCE A UNIQUE LINE ON THE            *
*            REPORT WITH DIFFERENT DATES AND/OR TIMES IT MAY          *
*            APPEAR AS IF EACH LINE IS A SEPARATE ACCESS              *
*            INSTEAD OF PART OF THE SAME PROCESS.                     *
*                                                                     *
*        2)  MULTIVOLUME SEQUENTIAL FILES WHICH ARE PROCESSED         *
*            AS BDAM FILES SUCH AS ADABAS DATASETS ARE                *
*            PROCESSED AS TRUE MULTIVOLUME FILES WITH THE             *
*            BLOCK COUNT REFLECTING THE TOTAL I/O FOR ALL             *
*            VOLUMES.                                                 *
*                                                                     *
*        3)  MULTIVOLUME VSAM FILES ALSO SHOW US AS MULTIVOLUME       *
*            DATASETS WITH I/O COUNTS REFLECTING THE TOTAL FOR        *
*            ALL VOLUMES.                                             *
*                                                                     *
*        4)  WHEN THE VOLSER IS REQUESTED ON THE REPORT, IT           *
*            WILL SHOW ONLY THE FIRST VOLUME OF A MULTIVOLUME         *
*            DATASET.  THERE WAS NO GOOD WAY TO DISPLAY ALL           *
*            OF THEM WITHOUT APPEARING AS SEPARATE EVENTS.            *
*                                                                     *
*        5)  WHEN SELECTING OR EXCLUDING BY VOLSER, ALL               *
*            VOLUMES FOR A MULTIVOLUME DATASET ARE CONSIDERED.        *
*            AGAIN, IF THE VOLSER IS PRINTED ON THE REPORT, IT        *
*            WILL SHOW ONLY THE FIRST VOLSER WHICH MAY NOT BE         *
*            THE VOLSER USED FOR SELECTION.                           *
*                                                                     *

*                           NOTE                                      *

*        DAY OF THE WEEK SELECTION CAN BE MADE ON THE ACCORDING       *
*        TO THE DAY OF THE WEEK ACCORDING TO THE DATE THE DATA        *
*        SET WAS OPENED OR CLOSED.  THE KEYWORD ODAY IS USED          *
*        TO SPECIFY WHICH DAYS WILL BE SELECTED BASED UPON            *
*        OPEN DATE.  THE KEYWORD CDAY IS USED FOR THE CLOSE           *
*        DATE.  ONE OR MORE SUBPARAMETERS CAN BE SPECIFIED ON         *
*        THE ODAY OR CDAY STATEMENT OR MULTIPLE STATEMENTS            *
*        CAN BE USED.  IN EITHER CASE, THE SUBPARAMETERS ARE          *
*        PROCESSED IN THE ORDER SPECIFIED.  SOME SUBPARAMETERS        *
*        "INCLUDE" ONE OR MORE DAYS WHILE OTHERS "EXCLUDE".           *
*        BECAUSE OF THIS THE ORDER OF ENTRY IS CRITICAL.  AT          *
*        LEAST 1 "INCLUDING" STATEMENT MUST BE USED OR NO DAYS        *
*        WILL BE SELECTED.  THE "INCLUDING' STATEMENTS ARE AS         *

*        AFTER "INCLUDING" DATA FOR SOME DAYS OF THE WEEK, ONE        *
*        OR MORE CAN THEN BE "EXCLUDED".  THE "EXCLUDING"             *
*        SUBPARAMETERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:                                *
*                                                                     *
*        1)  NOSUNDAY         EXCLUDE SUNDAY DATA                     *

*        IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THROUGH AN INVALID COMBINATION OF        *

*        1)  NEED FOR ALL DATA FOR THE SAME TIME RANGE FOR            *
*            SEVERAL DAYS.  THE EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND            *
*            IS WANTING ALL ACTIVITY FROM 8:00AM TO 5:00PM            *
*            FOR A DATE RANGE.  FOLLOWING IS HOW TO ACCOMPLISH        *
*            THIS:                                                    *

*            THIS WOULD DISPLAY ONLY ACTIVITY FOR DATASETS            *

*        2)  NEED FOR ALL DATA FROM A SPECIFIC TIME ON A              *
*            GIVEN DAY UNTIL A SPECIFIC TIME ON ANOTHER DAY.          *
*            THIS ALLOWS PROCESSING AN INVERVAL THAT CROSSES          *
*            THE MIDNIGHT TIME LINE.  FOLLOWING IS HOW TO             *

*            THIS WOULD DISPLAY ONLY ACTIVITY FOR DATASETS            *
*            THAT WERE OPENED AFTER 11:00AM ON THE FIRST              *
*            DAY UNTIL 01:00PM ON THE SECOND DAY.                     *
