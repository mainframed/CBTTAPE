         This program is designed to run as a TSO command, started
         task or a batch job to look up the selected module(s) in the
         system link list or link pack area.  If the module is in the
         link list, the link list library name will be displayed.  If
         the module is in the link pack area, its address will be
         displayed along with the name of the resident area in which it
         is located such as PLPA, FLPA, ECSA, etc.  The first part of
         each module is displayed also since it can contain date,
         time, or copyright information which may be of interest.


         When the program is run from TSO, the user will be prompted
         for a module name and the response will be displayed on the
         TSO user terminal.  When it is run as a started task, a WTOR
         request will be made for the module name and the response
         will be sent to the console.  If it is run as a batch job,
         the module name will be entered as the first 8 characters of
         a record read from the sysin file and the response will be
         written to the SYSPRINT file.

         The program will continue to ask for other module names until
         end-of-file is reached on the SYSIN file for a batch job or a
         'STOP', 'END', or '/*' is received from a TSO user or the
         operator console.



                           SAMPLE JCL

        BATCH JOB

        //JOBNAME  JOB ....
        //MODLOOK  EXEC PGM=MODLOOK
        //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
        //SYSIN    DD  *
        IDCAMS
        IEFW21SD



        STARTED TASK

        //MODLOOK  PROC
        //MODLOOK  EXEC PGM=MODLOOK

        The operator will be prompted for a module name and the
        results will be written to the console.



       TSO

       Just enter 'MODLOOK' at the READY prompt or under Option 6 of
       ISPF.



                            SPECIAL NOTE

         The advent of dynamic linklists has created an issue
         for this utility.  Different address spaces can now
         have different linklist concatinations.  The only
         information that this utility can access is for the
         linklist for the address space that calls this
         program.

         1)  ENTER MODLOOK MODULE NAME:

             This message prompts for another module name to be used
             to search the link list or link pack area.  if the
             response is 'STOP', 'END', or '/*', the program will
             terminate.
