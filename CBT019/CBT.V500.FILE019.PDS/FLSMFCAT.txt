*        IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THROUGH AN INVALID COMBINATION OF        *

*        THIS COMBINATION WOULD LOGICALLY EXCLUDE ALL DATA.           *

*        THIS COMBINATION WOULD LOGICALLY EXCLUDE ALL DATA.           *
*        IF ONLY EXCLUDING STATEMENTS ARE ENTERED, NO SELECTION       *
*        CAN OCCUR.  IT IS PROBABLY SAFER TO ONLY USE INCLUDING       *
*        STATEMENTS.                                                  *

*                       SPECIAL DATE/TIME ISSUES                      *
*                                                                     *
*        SELECTION OF DATA BY DATE AND TIME IS, BY NECESSITY,         *
*        A LITTLE CONVOLUTED.  THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT DATE AND       *
*        TIME CONDITIONS THAT ARISE:                                  *
*                                                                     *
*        1)  NEED FOR ALL DATA FOR THE SAME TIME RANGE FOR            *
*            SEVERAL DAYS.  THE EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND            *
*            IS WANTING ALL ACTIVITY FROM 8:00AM TO 5:00PM            *
*            FOR A DATE RANGE.  FOLLOWING IS HOW TO ACCOMPLISH        *
*            THIS:                                                    *
*                                                                     *
*            DATE=2003/07/07:2003/07/11                               *
*            TIME=08.00:17.00                                         *
*                                                                     *
*            THIS WOULD DISPLAY ONLY ACTIVITY FOR DATASETS            *
*            DURING PRIME SHIFT ON THE SPECIFIED DATES.               *
*                                                                     *
*        2)  NEED FOR ALL DATA FROM A SPECIFIC TIME ON A              *
*            GIVEN DAY UNTIL A SPECIFIC TIME ON ANOTHER DAY.          *
*            THIS ALLOWS PROCESSING AN INVERVAL THAT CROSSES          *
*            THE MIDNIGHT TIME LINE.  FOLLOWING IS HOW TO             *
*            ACCOMPLISH THIS:                                         *
*                                                                     *
*            DATE=2003/07/09:2003/07/10                               *
*            TIME=11.00:13.00                                         *
*            TIMEINCLUSIVE                                            *
*                                                                     *
*            THIS WOULD DISPLAY ONLY ACTIVITY FOR DATASETS            *
*            THAT WERE PROCESSED AFTER 11:00AM ON THE FIRST           *
*            DAY UNTIL 01:00PM ON THE SECOND DAY.                     *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*        SEE THE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION FOR DATE, TIME,             *
*        AND TIMEINCLUSIVE FOR DETAILS.  WITH THE FLEXABILITY         *
*        PROVIDED BY THIS UTILITY IT REALLY CAN GET A LITTLE          *
*        CONFUSING.                                                   *
