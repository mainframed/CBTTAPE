         This program is designed to print a report listing all of the
         datasets on a volume based upon information from the system
         catalogs.  The input to this program must be the output from
         an IDCAMS LISTCAT command.  It is expected that an IDCAMS
         'LISTCAT VOL CAT(user.catalog.name)' command will be executed
         for each catalog in the system.  The contents of these reports
         can then be examined for every dataset and volser to produce
         the report.

         If no PARM is entered on the EXECute statement for the program
         the report will print a report for all volumes which are found
         in the report.  The PARM can specify a volser or volser prefix
         that will be used to determine which volumes are to be listed.

         An optional DD statement for SYSUT2 can be included in the
         JCL for the program to produce a raw data file containing an
         entry for each dataset in the report.  If this file is not
         needed, simply omit the DD statement.  The format of each 80
         character record is as follows:

         01-06 - Volser
         07-50 - Dsname
         51    - Multi-volume indicator (M or blank)
         52-61 - Dataset type (NONVSAM, CLUSTER, AIX, or USERCAT)
         62-80 - Reserved

    Description: This message is generated by the FLVOLLST utility.
                 A SYSPRINT DD statement is required to define the

         Action: ABEND U002

    Description: This message is generated by the FLVOLLST utility.
                 A LISTCAT DD statement is required to define the

 Message Format: VOLL003 - THE PARM MUST SPECIFY A 1 TO 6 CHARACTER
                           VOLSER - JOB ABORTED

         Action: ABEND U003
