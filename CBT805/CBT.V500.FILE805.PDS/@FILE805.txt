//*     OVERVIEW                                                    *   FILE 805
//*     --------                                                    *   FILE 805
//*       This dataset contains several programs which may be of    *   FILE 805
//*       general interest to other installations.  They are, of    *   FILE 805
//*       course, available on an as-is condition with the usual    *   FILE 805
//*       disclaimer.                                               *   FILE 805
//*                                                                 *   FILE 805
//*       I am under no illusions about the level of my assembler   *   FILE 805
//*       coding skills.  I'm not an expert by any means.           *   FILE 805
//*       However, having said that, these programs were used in    *   FILE 805
//*       z/OS 1.7 and our current z/OS 1.9 environment.  They      *   FILE 805
//*       should work on any IBM supported system.  Some may not    *   FILE 805
//*       work on earlier systems.                                  *   FILE 805
//*                                                                 *   FILE 805
//*       This dataset contains the source code and JCL needed      *   FILE 805
//*       to establish an SNMP sub-agent, an EMC (Extended MCS)     *   FILE 805
//*       monitoring started task and an externally called          *   FILE 805
//*       storage snap program. Its sister dataset contains the     *   FILE 805
//*       user written macros needed to compile the programs.       *   FILE 805
//*       The IBM macros can be found in SYS1.MACLIB,               *   FILE 805
//*       TCPIP.SEZAMAC and SYS1.AMODGEN. A list of the macros      *   FILE 805
//*       and control block DSECTS used can be found in member      *   FILE 805
//*       $$CTLBLK.                                                 *   FILE 805
//*                                                                 *   FILE 805
//*       For some of the metrics I gather, I couldn't figure       *   FILE 805
//*       out how to get the information through control block      *   FILE 805
//*       chaining (I DID mention I wasn't an expert in this).      *   FILE 805
//*       To compensate for this, I use/call system REXX execs      *   FILE 805
//*       from which I issue JES2 commands, HSM commands, etc.      *   FILE 805
//*       and process the output from these commands. Not the       *   FILE 805
//*       most efficient way to do it, but it works.                *   FILE 805
//*                                                                 *   FILE 805
//*       2/10/09 - As of this writing, I have discovered a bug     *   FILE 805
//*       with system REXX in that AXRCMD does not handle           *   FILE 805
//*       certain types of multi-line command output (e.g.          *   FILE 805
//*       $DSPOOL, F HSM,QUERY CDS, etc.). A PMR has been opened    *   FILE 805
//*       with IBM.                                                 *   FILE 805

//*       This SNMP sub-agent attaches several subtasks which       *   FILE 805
//*       query/check various system metrics and updates            *   FILE 805
//*       established MIB values. These values may then be          *   FILE 805
//*       queried by an external monitor (such as NimBUS in our     *   FILE 805
//*       case) and alerting done. All of the SNMP interfacing      *   FILE 805
//*       is done via the Distributed Program Interface (DPI).      *   FILE 805
//*       See RFC 1228 for more information.                        *   FILE 805
//*                                                                 *   FILE 805
//*       Future enhancements:                                      *   FILE 805
//*       - Eliminate the system REXX execs by going directly to    *   FILE 805
//*         the control blocks                                      *   FILE 805
//*       - Finish the RENT process. Currently the sub-tasks are    *   FILE 805
//*         re-entrant but the overall load module is not.          *   FILE 805
//*       - Add a MODIFY command to dynamically change the timer    *   FILE 805
//*         interval for any of the sub-tasks (currently            *   FILE 805
//*         hardcoded).                                             *   FILE 805
//*                                                                 *   FILE 805

//*       The EMC monitoring program can be used to monitor         *   FILE 805
//*       console messages and issue SNMP traps to an external      *   FILE 805
//*       monitoring system for alerting purposes. The sample       *   FILE 805
//*       included here was based on a sample IBM program found     *   FILE 805
//*       in SYS1.SAMPLIB(IEAEXMCS).                                *   FILE 805

//*       Note: The EMC monitoring program issues SNMP traps.       *   FILE 805
//*       Ours is coded to use the 'awtrap' program which I         *   FILE 805
//*       found within the base Unicenter code from Computer        *   FILE 805
//*       Associates (CAI) and is found in the HFS/ZFS file:        *   FILE 805

//*       If you do not have access to this command, you will       *   FILE 805
//*       need to code or find own trap command or issue one via    *   FILE 805
//*       DPI.                                                      *   FILE 805
