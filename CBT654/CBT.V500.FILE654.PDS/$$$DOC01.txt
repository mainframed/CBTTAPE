Full Screen Interface (FSI) is a programming library modeled
after SPF that supports full screen 3270 programming.  To use
FSI, one more more application panels are coded and stored in the
Panel Library or PLIB data set.  The application program uses a
Display function call to display the panel.  Input / output
variables are used to allow the application to display dynamic
content to the screen and allow the application program to
retrieve input data from the terminal.

FSI uses an execution environment that the application program
must run underneath.  To run a FSI application, the FSI
environment must first be created using the FSISTART command
specifying the application name as a parameter.  The FSISTART
command will load the FSI environment and then attach the
application program.

Standard Disclaimer

FSI is a part-time fun project that I started working on while
traveling.  I found myself killing a lot of time in airports and
fired up MVS 3.8 under Hercules on my laptop.  The code "mostly
works" at this point.  There is a lot of need for improvement.
Error handling is almost non-existent.  I diagnose errors using
the TSO TEST command since the code produces very few error
messages.

There is a lot of room for enhancement and improvement if you
would like to help take this project forward.  When I get more
spare time I may try to improve upon what I have here.

This is by far not the best code I have ever written in my life
but it just evolved a few lines at a time.  Since I was
traveling, I did not have access to any of my reference
materials.  A lot of the original code was written to try
something out and see what happened.  When I get the right
results, I added more code and attempted something else.  If you
look at the code it will pretty much look as though is was
written that way.  There was no overall plan or design I was
working from.
