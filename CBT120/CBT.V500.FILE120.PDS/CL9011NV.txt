                MVS TOOLS AND TRICKS OF THE TRADE
                         November 1990

                                      Sam Golob
                                      MVS Systems Programmer


      This month, before our regular business, I'd like to thank a
big contributor to public software in the MVS world.  Bill Godfrey,
who works for Planning Research Corp. near Washington D.C., has
written many programs and TSO commands in current use by programmers
all over the world.  Bill has also extended the life of some older
IBM-distributed tools which would have gone by the wayside with the
arrival of XA and ESA.  Many of us probably do not realize that we
are using some of Bill's programs ourselves.

      Much of Bill's work was sent into the CBT MVS Tape while he was
working together with Jim Marshall of the Air Force.  Bill wrote the
stuff, and Jim would send it into Arnie Casinghino, who administers
the CBT tape.  A lot of Bill's pioneering work was done in the late
70's and early 80's.

      Just SOME examples of Bill Godfrey's work are:  the CDSCB program
for changing Format 1 VTOC entries (CDSCB was featured in my JULY 1990
column).  The $$MACROX modifications are source patches to the IFOX00
assembler, which allow all macro names and their originating libraries
to be reported in an assembly listing.  (The SLAC Mods to Assembler H
supply a similar report for the IEV90 assembler.)  Other TSO tools are
his LPSCB and CPSCB programs (for listing and modifying TSO session
attributes) and his many extensions to TSO EDIT and TSO TEST (some of
these were described in "TSO TEST Enhancements" by Alan Field - August
1990).

      Bill Godfrey has also contributed important disassemblies of the
IBM utilities INCORZAP and DELINK0 from the object code only versions,
making these programs available in readable assembler source.

      Bill's disassembly of INCORZAP into assembler source code is
especially noteworthy.  INCORZAP is a program which zaps IN-STORAGE
copies of NUCLEUS or LPALIB modules.  It was originally written in the
PL/S language by Robert Budge when he worked for IBM.  Later, after
Budge had left IBM and didn't have access to PL/S, he saw a copy of
Bill Godfrey's assembler source on a CBT tape.  The assembler language
version of INCORZAP allowed Budge to fix the code so that it could
modify protected storage under XA.

      Here's how INCORZAP works.  INCORZAP can look at the CSECT
structure of a module in SYS1.LPALIB or in the disk copy of the
NUCLEUS.  It then goes to the module's load point in core, doing
AMASPZAP-type VER and REP zaps on the IN-STORAGE versions of these
modules (plus a page fix).  Under old MVS/370, the PLPA and NUCLEUS
in-core storage had been accessible.  Under XA, some of that storage
is "protected".  Robert Budge's new version, called XACORZAP, can turn
off the protection, and change the storage anyway.

      Bill Godfrey is also the ORIGINAL author of "TSSO" (Time Sharing
Subsystem Option) which allows the execution of TSO commands on an MVS
system console.  Bill's original version of TSSO is on CBT Tape File
306.  Although the preferred version of TSSO is Version 4.3 from Marc
Schare (File 401), Bill Godfrey started bringing the TSO environment
to the domain of the operator console, paving the way for what
followed.

      Much of Bill Godfrey's code can still be found in Jim Marshall's
two large collections of tools.  TSO tools are on File 300 of the CBT
tape.  Batch programs are on File 316.  These collections are very
much worth exploring.  Robert Budge's XACORZAP code is found on
File 421, with full documentation included.

THE WONDERS OF THE NEW "REVIEW" COMMAND.

      Our regular topic concerns a neglected but useful GENERAL
BROWSING TOOL, the REVIEW command, which works under TSO.  REVIEW
was originally written by Bruce Leland.  Bruce's version appears
on the CBT Tape, File 296.  The extension of REVIEW which sparks our
current interest was written by Greg Price of Melbourne, Australia.
There is about DOUBLE the amount of code in Greg's version of REVIEW.
Greg's code appears in source on File 134 of the CBT tape, and in load
module form on File 135.

      Greg Price jokes about his version of REVIEW that "it is a case
of creeping featurism".  I myself feel that featurism is generally
useful for us sysprogs, who are always scrapping to acquire any power
or utility services that might be available.  Greg's REVIEW is FULL
of powers that await to be tapped.

      Greg Price's REVIEW contains an awful lot of function.  Greg
claims that his REVIEW will allow browsing of most files that have a
VTOC entry, including VSAM files; REVIEW will format individual
records within control intervals.  REVIEW will also allow browsing of
TAPE files, as well as disk files of up to 32760 bytes record length.
You can browse the active VSAM SMF file, as well as SMF history files
that have been written to tape.  REVIEW (in "SMF mode") will format
the SMF records by type, and will interpret much of the recorded data
on the TSO screen.  REVIEW will often allow you to look at files that
are currently OPEN.  REVIEW can also be told to bypass I/O error spots
and EOF markers, both on disk and on tape.  Many extremely large files
can be quickly REVIEWed FROM THE BOTTOM.  That's a feature which even
ISPF BROWSE doesn't have!

      Greg's REVIEW (unlike Bruce's earlier version) can handle an
entire partitioned dataset.  REVIEW has some special features that are
tailored for pds'es, notably its OFFLOAD of selected (or all) members
to a sequential dataset in IEBUPDTE format (preserving ISPF stats
if they are present).

             If you REVIEW a dataset name that is a pds, you are
presented with a sortable and flexible member list display (see Figure
One).  Much useful work can be done from this display.  This member
list also makes possible the OFFLOAD feature of REVIEW.

      The rest of our column will detail some of REVIEW's special
capabilities, so you can imagine some of the mileage that you might
get from it.


REVIEW AS A TSO COMMAND.

      Using REVIEW is very simple.  At a TSO terminal, one merely
types:

           REVIEW   dataset.name      (where the dataset.name refers
                                       to either a sequential dataset,
                                       a pds, or the VTOC name of a
                                       VSAM file.  It may also be a
                                       cataloged tape file.)

    or     REVIEW   filename  FILE    (where the filename is a ddname
                                       allocated to the TSO session.)

If dataset.name is a partitioned dataset, a complete member list
appears (see Figure One).  In the member list, one may enter a LINE
COMMAND of "S" (for REVIEW), "B" (for ISPF BROWSE if available) or "E"
(for ISPF EDIT if available).  An eight-byte "locate" field for
positioning to a given member, is the only input field on the member
list, besides the one-byte code input field on each line next to the
member name.  PFKEYS can be used as input to member list mode.  Their
meanings are listed in the prompt area at the top of the member list.
Some PFKEYS are devoted to sorting the member list in different ways.
Figure One shows various member list sorts, and gives other
information on using the member lists.

      If a sequential file or a VSAM file is being REVIEWed, the data
appears immediately.  See Figure Two for the sample REVIEWing of some
data.  When actually looking at data, we say we are in "REVIEW-data
mode".  All command descriptions which follow (except for the case
of member offloading) apply to being in REVIEW-data mode.

      When REVIEWing a member or a single dataset, the user has a lot
of flexibility.  PF1 is the HELP key.  A question mark "?" on the
command line or the "KEYS" command will have the same effect as PF1.
This will cause a second panel to be shown, which displays the current
use of the other PFKEYS.  See Figure Three.

      It pays to install Bruce Leland's fullscreen TSO help program
that is called "HEL".  HEL is found on CBT tape File 296 or on File
134.  The HEL load module is on File 135.  If the REVIEW "TSO help"
member has been put into the TSO SYSHELP concatenation, then a second
hit of PF1 will make detailed help available in fullscreen mode.

      Some general commands are available from the REVIEW-data mode
command line.  From the data mode command line, the "TSO" subcommand
will allow us to execute any TSO command from within REVIEW.  If we
are looking at a pds member, the "DIR" command, entered on the command
line, will get us into the member list mode.  From within any member,
the "MEM newmembr" command will switch us to REVIEWing another
member.

      ASCII data may be displayed on an EBCDIC terminal with the
"ASCII" command, which toggles ASCII mode on and off.  If SMF data
("live" from the VSAM file, or from a backup tape) is being displayed,
the "SMF" command toggles SMF record interpretation on and off.
Almost all types of SMF records are partially or completely
interpreted by the "SMF mode" of REVIEW.

      HEX data is displayed by the "HEX" command, which toggles
"HEX mode" on and off.  Newer color terminals may benefit from
"COLOR mode", which may be toggled on or off using the "COLOR"
command.

      Let's talk about actually looking at a dataset.  There are
various "FIND" commands which can help you.  "FIND" is an ordinary
string find command, but with the argument translated to uppercase.
This is similar to the action of the "FIND" subcommand in ISPF edit or
browse.  To achieve an "asis" effect, the "FINDCHR" command is used.
Under "FINDCHR", no uppercase translation is done.  "FINDHEX" helps
locate hex strings.  If SMF data is being looked at in SMF mode, the
"FINDSMF" command will locate the next occurrence of a given SMF
record type.

      The "LIST" command will position you to a particular logical
record number.  For example, "LIST 340" will position you to the
340th record of the file.  The usual "UP nnn" and "DOWN nnn",
"RIGHT nnn" and "LEFT nnn" commands are available.  "+" and "-"
are aliases for DOWN and UP.  "<" and ">" are aliases for LEFT and
RIGHT.  TOP and BOTTOM have their usual meanings.

      REVIEW has some conveniences built in, for looking at large
files.  Suppose we're trying to look at the BOTTOM of a file that has
200,000 records.  Let's say we've entered the "BOTTOM" command.  If
the records are FIXED BLOCKED, and REVIEW can calculate TTR data for
the bottom of the file, then REVIEW positions itself at the bottom
immediately.  No time-consuming block scanning has to be done.  For
variable-blocked data or for "find" searches where this technique
cannot be used, REVIEW has another feature that is good for the user.
Suppose you have entered the BOTTOM command on a large
variable-blocked file and the computer is cranking away.  A press of
"attention" will stop REVIEW in its tracks at the point where it
currently is.  You will see the point that it has gotten to thus far.
That relieves the suspense of waiting--you can follow REVIEW's
progress as it is moving along.  At any point, you may resume the
progress, by reentering BOTTOM or the particular "FIND" commmand you
were using.

      One of the neat features of REVIEW is the "NEWTOP" command that
can be used in REVIEW-data mode.  NEWTOP is issued with an operand of
a relative-TTR address to the beginning of the dataset, as in:

           NEWTOP  0010A

      When this is entered, REVIEW assumes that relative-TTR location
0010A within the dataset is the real top-of-data.  NEWTOP can thus be
used to position past I/O error spots and end-of-file markers in the
dataset.  Deleted PDS members and data past the "DS1LSTAR" high-water
mark of "valid data" can be browsed using this tool.  For tape files,
the operand of NEWTOP is interpreted as a relative block number.  One
can look at "inaccessible data" on tapes, too.  To reset REVIEW so that
it will again look at the real top of the data, simply enter "NEWTOP"
without any operands, or "NEWTOP 0".


OFFLOADING MEMBERS TO SEQUENTIAL DATASETS.

      REVIEW has the capability of "sequentializing" selected members
of partitioned datasets and preserving their ISPF statistics in that
process.  This facility depends on two things:  the REVIEW member list
for partitioned datasets, and pre-allocation of a SYSUT2 ddname to
a sequential output dataset that will receive the offloaded members.

      To use the OFFLOAD capability of REVIEW, simply REVIEW a pds
and get into member-list mode.  You should have previously allocated
a sequential dataset with compatible DCB attributes to the current
dataset, using the file name of SYSUT2.

      Then you do the following:  If you want to OFFLOAD all of the
members, sort the member list (using PFKEYS) into a desired order.
Then in the 8-byte "LOCATE" field of the member list, type the word
"=OFFLOAD".  REVIEW will signal when it has finished the offloading
process and has closed the SYSUT2 output dataset.

      If you want to offload only SOME of the members, do the
following:  Sort the member list in the most convenient way, or in
any desired order.  Then type "O" as a line command next to some of
the names you want to offload.  Press enter.  Doing this will
highlight the desired members in the member list.  Go down the member
list and choose all the members you want by typing "O" next to them
and pressing enter.  When you've finished, type "=OFFLOAD" in the
locate field as before.  REVIEW will offload the selected members in
the member list order, and will announce when it has closed the SYSUT2
dataset.

      The command "=REFRESH" in the locate field of the member list
will clear all members previously selected for offloading.  A line
command of "R" (which stands for REFRESH) next to a member chosen for
offload will cancel its selection.

      You can see that OFFLOAD is a useful facility.  You'll realize
this even more when you've used it yourself.


REVIEWING TAPES.

      Any cataloged tape file may be REVIEWed by entering its name
as the operand of the REVIEW command under TSO.  The tape file might
be described either as a dataset name or as a ddname (TSO file name).
If you are pointing to a ddname, the keyword "FILE" must follow the
name.

      A mount message will be issued to the MVS system console, and
the operators will be instructed to mount the tape.  Once mounted, the
tape is positioned to the beginning of the data in the cataloged file.

      Entering successive REVIEW subcommands will cause the tape to be
appropriately positioned, and REVIEW behaves similarly to the way it
did for a disk file.

      Uncataloged standard-labeled tape files can be REVIEWed by a TSO
user who has the MOUNT attribute, if the UNIT and VOLUME parameters are
used in the ALLOCATE command for the tape file.  This is OK as long as
the file sequence number is 1.  Greg Price supplies a CLIST for the
purpose of REVIEWing tape files whose file sequence number is not 1.
This CLIST comes on Greg's CBT Tape File 134 under the name REVTAPE.
The idea of the CLIST is to exploit the POSITION parameter of the
ALLOCATE TSO command for tape files.  Please see Figure Four for a
copy of Greg's REVTAPE CLIST, and notice his comments there.

      Greg Price's REVIEW has more power than we have described, and
it is very much worth a good look from every MVS sysprog.  I hope that
our introduction will stimulate your creativity, and that this useful
program will help your shop.  Good luck.  See you next month.

FIGURE ONE.  MECHANICS OF THE REVIEW MEMBER LIST.

              Illustration of REVIEW partitioned dataset member list,
              sorted in various ways.  Note that the "LOCATE" field
              has 8 characters for positioning the list, and for
              command input.  Command input in the LOCATE field
              must be preceded by an equal sign.  Only currently
              supported commands from the LOCATE field are
              =OFFLOAD and =REFRESH.  An "S" LINE COMMAND next
              to a member name will REVIEW the member.  If ISPF
              is active, then "B" will BROWSE the member, and
              "E" will EDIT it.  "O" next to a member will flag it
              after enter is pressed, for offloading using =OFFLOAD.
              Member list PFKEY instructions are shown on the
              second line.

FIGURE THREE.   REVIEW HELP SCREEN FOR PFKEYS.

                 This screen may be entered any time the user is
                 looking at a dataset.  The "KEYS" command or a
                 question mark "?" will invoke this panel.  An
                 invalid command, such as "U", will return the
                 user to REVIEWing the dataset.

FIGURE FOUR.   GREG PRICE'S CLIST FOR REVIEWING DATA ON TAPES.

                This CLIST is needed for looking at tape files that
                do not have a file sequence number of 1.  One can
                see from Greg's comments that the REVIEW command can
                open new horizons to the programmer.
