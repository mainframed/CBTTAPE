SMP/E Preprocessing

      This month we'll be talking about SMP/E Preprocessing, which I
helped develop about fifteen years ago, and which is still useful
today.  SMP/E Preprocessing has to do with keeping track of your
operating system maintenance PTFs.  With the techniques we'll discuss
today, you can have a great measure of power and control over the
fixes that will go on to your system, even before SMP/E has ever
"seen" them.

      The idea of SMP/E Preprocessing is to look at a tape file of
maintenance PTFs or any SMPPTFIN file, before it goes on to your
system.  I've found it wise never to completely trust IBM's software
packaging, and I always try and study how it is put together.
On occasion, IBM will claim to have sent a certain PTF on a tape, and
it really isn't there.  You only find out about the error after you've
attempted to RECEIVE the PTF from the tape, and SMP/E tells you there
are no PTFs eligible to be RECEIVEd.  SMP/E does not give you any
actual knowledge or information about the contents of the SMPPTFIN
tape file.  All SMP/E tells you, is whether the desired PTF is there,
or not.  No other information is forthcoming, unless you're willing
to risk RECEIVEing many other PTFs that you may not want.

      How, then, can you pre-screen an SMPPTFIN file?  You can copy
it to disk and attempt to BROWSE it with ISPF.  Then you can do
repeated FIND commands for the "++ PTF" keyword, starting in column
1, that indicates the presence of a new PTF.  Having found a PTF, you
can next look for the FMID keyword which denotes the system component
that the PTF belongs to.  However, since IBM-shipped PTF files can be
very large, sometimes containing 20 million lines or more, this is not
usually a practical way of finding out what is going on.  However, I
must say that the REVIEW program from File 134 of the CBT MVS Tape is
considerably better than ISPF Browse for this purpose.

      We have a far better way to pre-examine PTF files.  Almost 20
years ago, Jerry Lawson of the Hartford Insurance Group wrote an
assembler program which reads an SMPPTFIN file, and which sorts all
the PTFs on it, by the product id (FMID) to which they belong.  The
output of Jerry's program is a report.  With this program, we can read
a PTF tape and find out what products and PTF numbers are represented
in it.  Even a very large SMPPTFIN file can be processed very quickly
by Jerry's program.  At least this is a step in the right direction.
We can pre-screen a PTF tape to find out what's on it.  The only
drawback is that we can't directly use the report data, as it stands,
to feed input to an SMP/E job.

      For this reason, I was not fully satisfied with Jerry's report
as it was.  I wrote a COBOL post-processing program to read the
report, and to format the PTF numbers, arranged by FMID, so they could
be directly fed into a new SMP/E RECEIVE, APPLY, or ACCEPT job.  This
gave me full FORFMID control of the SMPPTFIN tape, before SMP/E ever
"got its grubby paws" on it.

      Another problem we have with looking at an SMPPTFIN file, is
that it's often very large.  Wouldn't it be nice to break it up into
a pds, with each PTF as a separate member?  Then, you could BROWSE,
EDIT, or otherwise pre-process each PTF as a separate entity, instead
of being forced to look at it as a small part of a huge file.  I
solved this problem by writing another COBOL program to help me
break up any SMPPTFIN file by PTFs, APARs, USERMODs, or FUNCTIONs.
(Sorry to have used COBOL, but it was quick and dirty, and
it worked.)  By breaking up the original huge file into its component
PTFs, seen separately, we can have access to much more initial
information about a PTF if we want it.  We'll see more about this,
later on.

      Now, we'll look into some of the details of each of these
techniques, so that you'll be able to add these "weapons" to your
arsenal of system control tools.  I'll show you a lot of the control
over PTFs that you can gain, and you can use your own inventiveness
and creativity to further exploit this additional knowledge.


WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE SOFTWARE

      Jerry Lawson's report program, and my supporting programs, can
be found on File 118 of the CBT MVS Utilities Tape, which is a huge
collection of free MVS software that is independently produced.  You
can order physical tapes throgh NaSPA, or you can duplicate a tape if
somebody else has one (a good tape duplication program can be found
on File 229 of the CBT Tape).  Most of the CBT Tape materials can be
found on the NaSPA cd-rom.  However, the best place to get to specific
CBT Tape files is to download them from www.naspa.net, which points to
the NaSPA-sponsored site at www.cbttape.org.  Simply go to www.naspa.net
and click on "Online CBT Tape".  Then click on "Download CBT".  When
you go to the online home of the CBT Tape, you're assured of getting
the latest versions of the files.

      On CBT Tape File 118, Jerry Lawson's program is called PUTXREF,
and my post-processing program is called SMPFMUPV.  A sample execution
jobstream is included as member JCL2.  I wrote my original COBOL
programs in VS/COBOL, but I've included COBOL II versions of the
source, and there are 3 compile and linkedit jobs, IGYWCL1, IGYWCL2,
IGYWCL3, which compile the COBOL II source programs under LE/370.  In
my tests, these programs worked correctly.  The latest software is
scheduled to be loaded on Version 420 of the CBT Tape, File 118, but
meanwhile, it can be found on the net at:
ftp://ftp.cbttape.org/pub/cbttape/adhoc/file118.zip .  When this file
is downloaded to the pc, you can unzip it and then upload it in binary
(i.e. no translation or crlf) to the MVS system.  The dataset will be
in TSO XMIT format, and to make it usable, you do a TSO RECEIVE
INDATASET('yourid.FILE118.XMI').  You'll get a partitioned dataset
that contains all the good stuff.  In case you can't get the newest
version of File 118, the source programs SMPFMU2V and SMPUPD2 are
correct, except for one data name in SMPUPD2 called FUNCTION, which
became a COBOL reserved word, and which has to be changed to FUNCTON.

HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE

      In Figure 1, I've included a sample of execution JCL for a
jobstream to look at an SMPPTFIN file, which could be on tape or on
disk, and to produce Jerry Lawson's PUTXREF report.  This is followed
by my post-processing, which produces a file like the one shown in
Figure 2.  You'll see that every SYSMOD on the SMPPTFIN file is
reported according to its FMID, and you can feed the output into
SELECT statements on an SMP/E RECEIVE, APPLY, or ACCEPT job.

      In practice, I maintain a partitioned dataset which records
the contents of every input SMPPTFIN tape I have.  I run each of
them through this processing, and I write a new pds member
corresponding to each tape.  I call the partitioned dataset
userid.PTFPDS or some similar name, and I keep it around
permanently.  If I need to find on which tape a particular PTF is, I
do a dataset search with the FIND subcommand of the PDS program
(from File 182 of the CBT Tape).  If you're licensed for STARTOOL
(from Serena Inc. in Burlingame, California), it performs the same
function.  The FIND subcommand can be used to globally scan across
all members of the pds, and it will show every tape I have, which
contains that particular PTF.  With the PDS command pointed at my
PTFPDS dataset, a sample search command might be:  FIND : /ptfname/
where the colon (:) denotes a command to search all members of the
PTFPDS partitioned dataset.

      In addition, I can do a FIND on a particular FMID, and the
PDS program will show me every PTF I have in house on a tape, which
belongs to that FMID.  If you examine Figure 2, you'll see that the
comment field next to each PTF number, contains the FMID that the
PTF belongs to, and you can search on that FMID name.  You can use
whatever global search utility you have, against all or some of the
members of this pds, and you can instantly see how useful this kind
of processing can be.


BREAKING A BIG SMPPTFIN FILE INTO SEPARATE PTFS

      My SMPUPD program from File 118 of the CBT Tape can be used
to break up an SMPPTFIN file into a pds containing each PTF as a
separate member.  The COBOL II version of the SMPUPD source is called
SMPUPD2.  All that SMPUPD does is to make a copy of the SMPPTFIN file
with a few subtle changes.  Before each ++ PTF keyword (or ++ APAR
or ++ USERMOD or ++ FUNCTION), SMPUPD inserts an IEBUPDTE-type
./ ADD NAME=ptfname card, containing the name of the PTF or other
SYSMOD that's there.  This serves to separate each SYSMOD in the
SMPPTFIN file from its neighbor.  SMPUPD also does one more thing.
It changes any ./ string starting in column 1, which would denote an
internal IEBUPDTE control card in the PTF, to a different string:
./.  This allows for the correct IEBUPDTE or PDSLOAD post-processing
of the copied (and changed) SMPUPD output file.

      I have to talk about our IEBUPDTE substitute program called
PDSLOAD.  PDSLOAD can be found on File 093 of the CBT Tape.  Besides
performing a member load of a partitioned dataset from an IEBUPDTE
format sequential dataset (the equivalent of IEBUPDTE, PARM=NEW),
PDSLOAD can be set up to automatically convert all of the imbedded
./ strings within each member, back to the original ./ strings they
once were.  Thus, if you use PDSLOAD instead of IEBUPDTE to load the
SMPUPD-modified copy of the original SMPPTFIN dataset into a pds,
you won't have to convert imbedded >< strings globally back to ./ as
they originally were.  If you use PDSLOAD to create your pds, the
original PTFs will be separated and correct as they were shipped.
Look at sample JCL member SMPUPDJ, in File 118 of the CBT Tape, or
look at Figure 3, to see how to load a partitioned dataset with the
separated PTFs.

      The value of being able to look at separate PTFs from a big
SMPPTFIN file is obvious to most people.  If you only care about one
PTF, you don't have to look at other PTFs that you don't want to see.
You might also want to RECEIVE the single PTF directly, and not as a
part of a big file.  But there's another, more subtle advantage, if
you know how to read the object decks that are on each PTF.

      Sometimes you need to fit a system modification, such as a
load module zap, to a new version of an IBM module.  If IBM doesn't
provide source code for the new version, or if you can't get to the
source code display from IBMLINK, you've got another alternative.
You can disassemble the code from the object deck that's shipped
with the latest PTF.  Normally, disassemblers don't read 80-byte
format object decks directly.  So you can use the ISPF editor to
copy the object deck to a separate file, linkedit it, and then
disassemble the resulting load module, so you can fit your mod.
Free disassemblers can be found on Files 171, 217, 238-242, and
354 of the CBT Tape.

      However, if you're lucky enough to have the STARTOOL vendor
product from Serena (mentioned above), STARTOOL has a disassembler
that will directly disassemble code from an 80-byte object deck.
The STARTOOL object code disassembler is invoked with the READOBJ
subcommand.  Using STARTOOL, you can point to the pds that contains
the PTFs separated from the SMPPTFIN file, or an SMPPTS dataset for
that matter.  Get a member list under STARTOOL (ML subcommand), and
then invoke the line command of READ against any PTF in the dataset.
This will instantly disassemble all the object decks in the PTF.
You can now look at the assembler code in the PTFs, to help in
fitting your mods.

      I hope this month's talk was instructive.  The techniques
certainly are different than what you normally see as an MVS systems
programmer.  But their utility value is obvious, and in the long run
you'll save a lot of maintenance time, if you make a regular practice
of incorporating these methods in your everyday work.  Good luck.
See you next month.

Figure 1.   JOBSTREAM TO RUN BASIC SMP/E PREPROCESSING

            This jobstream takes an SMPPTFIN file (a PTF file on
            disk or on tape) and first runs Jerry Lawson's PUTXREF
            report against it.  Then, the job runs postprocessing
            program SMPFMUPV against the report, to produce an
            80-byte PTF list sorted by FMID, as shown in Figure 2.
