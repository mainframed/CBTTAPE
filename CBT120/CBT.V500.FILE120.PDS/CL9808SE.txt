When IBM Says You Can't... Sometimes You Can - Part 2

      I admit that I'm very spoiled by my system programmer tool
collection.  I can do stuff that other people "can't do".  But I'm
willing to share my "secrets".  That's what this column is all
about.  Any tool or trick that makes our working life easier, or
that reduces system down time, or which helps the system to run more
efficiently, is fair game for discussion in this column.

      IBM supplies many tools which come with an MVS or OS/390
operating system.  Some of these are very basic, functional, and user
unfriendly, such as AMASPZAP.  Others are very complicated, quite
friendly, and have lots of features, such as ISPF and PDF.  Still
others are very complicated, not too friendly, but do a good job, such
as SMP/E.  Just about everything that IBM supplies, works.  (I've seen
one or two things that didn't.)  But no matter how much IBM specifically
supplies, there's always room for improvement.  That's because IBM
never made a goal for themselves, to supply every tool a user will
ever need.  Rather, they deliver very functional basic tools, and leave
a lot of room for users (and vendors) to build further tools from the
robust processing structures which they supply.

      I'd say that MVS and OS/390 are quite "accessible systems".
This is what I mean.  Users can write programs to run under MVS, which
perform functions that IBM themselves never intended to write.  For
example:  I don't think IBM ever intended to release a program to
dynamically load new versions of JES2 exits.  Another example:
Initially, the SPF and ISPF designers never designed one
multi-function member list menu, under which you could BROWSE, EDIT,
RENAME, DELETE, add or change ISPF statistics, or examine many
internal details of a pds member, all from the same member list.  A
third example:  IBM hasn't come out with an interactive disassembler
(load module to assembler source code) until recently, or a convenient
interactive delinker (load module to 80-byte object decks) at all.
IBM hadn't done any of these things.  But users have.  And their tools
were largely built on the building blocks which IBM itself has
supplied.

      I think that IBM deserves praise for building products that have
foundations for adding more function.  But the function won't come,
unless the users, or vendors, take it upon themselves to do the adding.
Fortunately, many users have already done a lot of work, and their
products are available to the public.  The result is that there are
large collections of free tools for MVS which everyone can use, if
they'd but take the time to obtain and install them.

      One of the large collections of tools is the CBT MVS Utilities
Tape, and its companion, the CBT Overflow Tape.  These are independently
produced collections of machine-readable software and other goodies,
most of them in source code form.  The CBT Tapes contain documentation
about other collections as well.  Information about the CBT Tapes can
be obtained at a web site:  http://members.aol.com/cbttape  and the
tapes themselves can also be obtained from the NaSPA office and other
places.  If you have any one of these tapes, you can make many copies
for others, using a program on the tape called COPYMODS, from File
229.

      Now, we'll talk about a few things that IBM says you can't do,
because they don't supply you with the tools.  And we'll see how you
can do them indeed, with tools you can get from the CBT MVS Tape.
These tools were built by users like you and me.


CLIPPING A PACK WHILE IT'S ONLINE

      "Clipping" a disk pack is another name for changing its volume
serial name.  In other words, if the pack's id was PACK01, you might
need to change it to PACK02.  IBM's standard method for doing this is
to take the pack offline, and to run its low-level disk pack support
program, ICKDSF in a batch job, to change the id.  This works well, as
do almost all of the IBM-supplied utilities.  Only problem is, that you
have to take the pack offline first.

      Normally, taking a disk pack offline is not a big problem.  You
go to the operator console and vary the unit offline.  If the unit is
currently being used, it won't come offline right away, but it will
remain "pending offline" until all of the active tasks using that pack
have terminated.  However, sometimes there's an emergency, and you
can't wait for the pack to go offline, or you can't get it to go
offline at all.  Then, you need to have another technique up your
sleeve.

      Enter the UCLA Fullscreen ZAP program.  As designed originally
by a group of systems programmers at UCLA, Fullscreen ZAP is made to
change bytes of data in any dataset, not just load modules.  The ZAP
program is a TSO Command Processor, designed to work under TSO.  ZAP
shows you a full screen of data in a record (really a block) from the
dataset, and allows you to examine or change any byte.  I might add,
that Fullscreen ZAP has its own built-in "help" information, and it's
a lot more user-friendly than IBM's AMASPZAP program.  Fullscreen ZAP
is powerful stuff, but it's not ready for our pack clipping needs,
just yet.

      Along came Greg Price, who added a super-powerful feature to the
Fullscreen ZAP program--the FULLVOL keyword.  If you're running ZAP as
an authorized TSO command (normally it doesn't have to run authorized),
and you add the FULLVOL keyword after the dataset name, some high power
"magic" is then done.  Before opening the dataset, ZAP (under FULLVOL)
manipulates the DEB (Data Extent Block) for the dataset to say that the
extents for the dataset encompass the entire pack.  So instead of
showing you the beginning of the dataset, ZAP, under FULLVOL, shows you
the beginning of the pack--cylinder 0, track 0, record 1!

      Now, you can begin to see what we're getting at.  Where is a
disk pack's id record?  It's on cylinder 0, track 0, record 3.  After
specifying a dataset that's on the pack you want to clip (you can use
'FORMAT4.DSCB' as a dataset name, with the VOL( ) keyword to specify
the particular pack), you add the FULLVOL keyword, and Fullscreen ZAP
will place you just two records before the record you want to see.
You advance two records by entering the "R" subcommand twice, and
there you are!  The volume id field can be reached at 8 bytes off the
beginning of the 3rd record, so you enter the subcommand "+8" to get
there.  The next 6 bytes are the volume id.  You can enter an "S"
subcommand to replace the id with another name, and you use the "ZAP"
subcommand of ZAP, to write the changes to disk.  The pack is now
clipped.  On newer MVS systems, and on OS/390 systems, the new pack id
will go into effect when the pack goes offline and comes back online
again.  On older systems such as MVS/XA, you vary the pack offline,
and you have to do a MOUNT command, specifying the new volume id,
after the pack is varied online again.

      Here's one of my own war stories.  I once had a problem where
there were two identically-named packs on the same "running MVS
system".  The first one, with the lower unit name, had incorrect data
on it.  The second one, which had been restored from a backup, had the
correct data.  For a certain reason, we had much difficulty getting the
first pack offline.  It was during production time, and we had to re-IPL
very soon.  You can tell me what would happen after the IPL.  The wrong
pack, which had the lower unit address, would come online again, unless
you entered the proper operator response to the "duplicate id" message.
Our operators (on a different floor) weren't trained correctly for the
reply.  I had the quick solution.  I placed a dummy "unique" dataset on
the "wrong" volume, and invoked ZAP for that dataset, using the FULLVOL
keyword.  Then I changed that pack's volume serial name as we've
described.  After the IPL, the correct pack came up under its own
volser name, and the old pack came up under its new name.  See how
useful such a technique is?


PRESERVING ISPF STATS AFTER "IEBUPDTE" SEQUENTIALIZATION

      I don't know how important ISPF statistics are to you.  But they
often are very important to me.  ISPF statistics show how large a pds
member is.  They show who updated the member last, and when.  When
you're looking through a library of source code, the ISPF statistics
will show a lot of telltale information and necessary history for each
member.  If you're moving a "source-type" pds from one location to
another, I'd bet you'd really prefer to preserve the ISPF statistics
of the members.

      IEBUPDTE is an IBM utility that is most often used for updating a
card-image source code member with an incremental update, using its
./ CHANGE NAME=memname  control cards.  IEBUPDTE can also be used to
"string out" all (or several) members of a partitioned dataset into a
single sequential dataset, with the member data strung out, one member
after another.  Data from one member is distinguished from data from
the next member by an IEBUPDTE header card in the form:
      ./ ADD NAME=memname
which separates each member from the next.  You can reconstitute the
partitioned dataset from the sequentialized IEBUPDTE-format dataset,
by another invocation of IEBUPDTE, with PARM=NEW.  Each sequentialized
member will be stowed as a separate new member by the IEBUPDTE
program, which reads the ./ ADD cards, to act as separators.

      IEBUPDTE has one disadvantage in this process.  IBM invented
IEBUPDTE before they invented ISPF statistics.  The IEBUPDTE utility
has a provision to preserve SSI information, which was present in
"ancient times", but it simply has no provision to include control
information about ISPF statistics in its ./ ADD cards.  So the stowed
members, after an IEBUPDTE sequentialization and reload of a pds, do
not have the ISPF statistics preserved.  They simply get lost.

      Enter some clever users, who created and standardized their own
system of preserving ISPF statistics in ./ ADD cards.  This system has
become so popular, that we don't need IBM.  Several programs on the CBT
Tape will perform the sequentialization and create ./ ADD cards with
the ISPF stats in this format, and several other programs will
reconstitute pds members from this format, with the ISPF statistics
preserved.  See Figure 1 for the format of the ./ ADD cards that have
the ISPF stats.

      Programs which sequentialize a pds and preserve ISPF stats are:
LISTPDS from File 316 of the CBT Tape (using the following parms):

//    PARM='UPDTE(><),SPF,NOLIST,DECK,NOSEL' ,

OFFLOADW from File 093 of the CBT Tape, and REVIEW from File 134.  To
use REVIEW under TSO for this purpose, you allocate FILE(SYSUT2) to
an already created sequential output dataset, REVIEW a pds member, use
the DIR subcommand while under REVIEW to get a directory listing, and
from the directory listing, invoke the =OFFLOAD subcommand.  In
addition, the vendor product STARTOOL (from Serena International) with
its COMBINE subcommand, adheres to these same conventions.

      Programs which reload a partitioned dataset from a sequential
version and preserve ISPF stats are:  PDSLOADW from File 093 of the
CBT Tape, and the SEPARATE function of the vendor product, STARTOOL.
In addition, OFFLOADW and PDSLOADW aren't restricted to LRECL=80.  They
both can handle fixed blocked datasets with record lengths up to 256.


OLD LINKAGE EDITOR RESTRICTIONS

      You may not know it, but you can still execute the old linkage
editor (as opposed to the DFSMS binder) by executing PGM=HEWLKED
instead of PGM=HEWL.  The old linkage editor, which is still
distributed with DFSMS on OS/390, currently has the restriction that
card-image object decks cannot be blocked with a factor of more than
40, that is, the block size can't be bigger than 3200.  This is a silly
restriction from OS/MFT days, that was finally eliminated only with the
introduction of the binder.

      This restriction of the old linkage editor was never removed by
IBM for all these years.  What's so surprising, is that the restriction
is artificial, and is hard-coded into the linkage editor code, even in
the DFSMS version of HEWLKED.  You can re-code the maximum block sizes
for object decks, to a block size of 32720, and a blocking factor of
409, by zapping a few places in the linkage editor.  Sample zaps to do
this may be found on File 257 of the CBT Tape, and I've shown one of
them in Figure 2.  I'm mentioning this fact, just to illustrate how
easily an age-old IBM restriction can sometimes be removed.

      To sum up, every time IBM mentions a restriction which bothers
you, you should take it with a grain of salt.  Frequently, you can't
get around it.  But sometimes, more often than not, you can.  If you
have a question about some IBM restriction, post a query on the
IBM-MAIN Internet forum (see this column, April 1998).  Many of the
people who monitor that forum are knowledgeable in free system tools.
There may very well be a way around the restriction after all.
