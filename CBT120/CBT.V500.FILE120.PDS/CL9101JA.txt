"THE ARCHIVER" PART II - MORE ABOUT AN INTRIGUING NEW PRODUCT.

      Last month, we introduced the new free product called "The
ARCHIVER".  The ARCHIVER stores and compresses non-VSAM data of almost
any type, into one single VSAM cluster.  This compressed data is
item-by-item exportable, still compressed, onto a tape file.  All the
data can be faithfully reconstituted to its original form from either
the "archive" VSAM cluster or from the "archive export" tape.

      "The ARCHIVER", originally designed as a vehicle for sysprogs to
store "all their stuff in one place", has the potential to eventually
revolutionize small-scale in-house backups, and to allow far more
efficient packaging of software collections and products.

      As a personal example, I have stored the contents of 274
SMP-related pds libraries, and 15 large sequential datasets, in one
VSAM "archive" cluster.  After reorganization, the VSAM cluster
occupied around 10000 tracks of 3380 disk space.  The "archive export"
tape, which contained all this data, occupied barely more than one and
a half 3480 cartridges.  My previous, less efficient IEBCOPY backups
took about eight cartridges on average.

      "The ARCHIVER" Version 4.0 or above, can be obtained on a NEW
CBT MVS Tape at version level 321 or higher.  The ARCHIVER is on
File 147.

      Please use Version 4.0 or higher of The ARCHIVER, because The
ARCHIVER was extensively reworked at that level.  Previous versions
don't have the great data compression.  VSAM files created with
previous "ARCHIVER" versions are upwardly convertible using the
CONVERT command of the current "ARCHIVER" version.

      This month, I'll explain some further details of ARCHIVER
workings to add to what we said last month, and I'll show some more
examples.  I hope that you can exploit The ARCHIVER creatively for
your advantage, and to the advantage of your shop.


A QUICK REVIEW.

      The ARCHIVER is written by Rick Fochtman from Chicago.  It
stores almost any kind of data in a VSAM cluster.   A stored data
item has 5 keys--the first four, member name, group, subgroup, and
type--have 10 characters apiece.  The last key, the version number,
is a binary integer that ranges from 1 to a large value (16 Meg).
Keyword parameters are used in almost all the control statements.
Individual entries are referred to as "items".

      Storing an item in a VSAM Archive cluster is called UNLOADing.
Comments in a control statement start with an asterisk in column 1.
Dynamic allocation of required files is done either by a SET control
statement or a DSN or DDN keyword parameter.  We'll give an example.
To UNLOAD all members of a PDS into an archive, we may use control
statements such as:

  SET VSAM1DSN=TST.SAMPLE.ARCHIVE
  SET DSN=TST.OUR.SAMPLE.PDS
  UNLOAD ITEM=(*,SAMPLEPDS,11/09/90,PRODUCTION)

or more easily:

  SET VSAM1DSN=TST.SAMPLE.ARCHIVE
  UNLOAD ITEM=(*,SAMPLEPDS,11/09/90,PRODUCTION),DSN=TST.OUR.SAMPLE.PDS

These statements will cause all members of the dataset:
TST.OUR.SAMPLE.PDS to be unloaded (and compressed) into the previously
defined VSAM cluster:  TST.SAMPLE.ARCHIVE .  See Figure One for a
complete example.  See Figure Two for a list of ARCHIVER control
statements and what they do.  This material was discussed in detail
last month.  Now, we'll pick up where we left off, and we'll talk
about how The ARCHIVER dynamically allocates most of the files that it
needs.


THE ARCHIVER'S DYNAMIC FILE ALLOCATION.

      File allocation when using The ARCHIVER is regulated by the
"SET" control statement.  There are three forms of SET.  These are:

      SET VSAM2DDN=ddname    or  SET VSAM2DSN=cluster name
      SET VSAM1DDN=ddname    or  SET VSAM1DSN=cluster name
      SET DDN=ddname         or  SET DSN=non-VSAM dsname

VSAM2DDN or VSAM2DSN is used only in a situation when there are two
clusters involved in the operation.  In that case, VSAM2D-N would
refer to the "from" cluster and VSAM1D-N would refer to the "to"
cluster.  Examples are the "COPY" or "CONVERT" control statements.
("CONVERT" moves items from an old-format ARCHIVE cluster to a
current-format cluster.)  These operations copy or convert items from
one ARCHIVE cluster to a second.

      During most other ARCHIVER operations, when only one VSAM
cluster is involved, VSAM1DDN or VSAM1DSN is used to point to the
cluster.

      Non-VSAM datasets are always pointed to by SET DDN or SET DSN
statements.  Of course, a SET DDN statement must refer to a ddname
specified in your JCL.  A SET DSN statement will automatically invoke
dynamic allocation to get to a cataloged non-VSAM dataset.  Currently,
SET DDN statements pointing to ddnames, are the only way for The
ARCHIVER to get to non-cataloged non-VSAM datasets.

      VSAM cluster values or non-VSAM dataset names that are specified
by SET operands will remain in effect until overridden by another SET
operand.  In addition, the VSAM2DDN, VSAM1DDN, DSN etc. statements can
be appended to the operands of any other ARCHIVER command.  For
example:

       UNLOAD ITEM=(*,*,LINKLIB,*),DSN=TSTBSSG.TEST.LINKLIB

would be the equivalent of:

       SET    DSN=TSTBSSG.TEST.LINKLIB
       UNLOAD ITEM=(*,*,LINKLIB,*)                   .

That's pretty much the story when it comes to The ARCHIVER's dynamic
allocation.  It's quite straightforward and simple.

      Currently, there's one "gotcha" in the matter.  "LOADT", which
copies items from an item-selectable ARCHIVE tape dataset to a pds or
sequential dataset, performs a similar function to "LOAD", which goes
from a VSAM archive dataset to the non-VSAM dataset.  In other words,
"LOAD" and "LOADT" are parallel functions.  Currently, the input to
"LOADT" is the same as the input to "LOAD", namely VSAM1DDN or
VSAM1DSN, even though the item-selectable tape dataset is not a VSAM
dataset.  Normally, a VSAM1DSN statement would be inappropriate to
point to a non-VSAM dataset, and would cause an error.

      If you would run a "LISTT" against the item-selectable tape
dataset, VSAM1DSN or VSAM1DDN wouldn't work.  Since the dataset is
really non-VSAM, you need to use DSN or DDN to do the dynamic
allocation for "LISTT".  This matter is somewhat confusing, but I
think it is the only significant "SET" control statement problem.
Rick may correct this situation in the future.  If he does, he will
inform you.  This slight problem in use, is greatly outweighed by The
ARCHIVER's enormous data storage advantages.


CHANGING EXISTING ENTRIES IN THE VSAM CLUSTER.

      The ARCHIVER service functions can control entries in a VSAM
archive dataset very closely.  The "ALTER" control statement, also
termed "RESPECIFY" in older ARCHIVER versions, accomplishes a renaming
and re-keying service for archived items.

      Syntax for ALTER is:

   ALTER ITEM=(.......),NEW=(.......)

where the NEW operand has the same syntax as the ITEM operand with an
important exception.  In the NEW operand, generic characters such as
"*" and "%" are treated as ordinary characters, and can be a part of
the key names.  Only the "*" character alone will be treated in the
NEW operand as a generic, to signify that the corresponding old value
will remain unchanged.  "RESPECIFY" still remains a valid alias for
the ALTER control statement.

      Let's give an example of how ALTER might be used.

      Suppose two pds'es have been unloaded into an archive.  One of
them is SYS1.LINKLIB and the other is PPS.LINKLIB, a program product
library.  The UNLOAD statements might read:

   UNLOAD ITEM=(*,SYS1LINKLB,11/15/90,MVSRES),DSN=SYS1.LINKLIB
   UNLOAD ITEM=(*,PPSLINKLIB,11/15/90,VEND01),DSN=PPS.LINKLIB

      You might want to change the some of the modules in PPS.LINKLIB
to have a special designation.  Suppose all modules beginning with the
designation "ISR" are to be singled out into a category called ISPF/PDF.
Our ALTER statement might then read:

   ALTER ITEM=(ISR*,PPSLINKLIB,*,*),NEW=(*,ISPF/PDF,*,*)

      It is clear that a lot of item rearranging may be accomplished
from within the VSAM archive, after many items have already been
unloaded into it.

      Because of key arrangement, however, CA and CI splits and
space expansion may occur through extensive use of ALTER.  If you are
constantly manipulating a VSAM archive file, it is wise to reorganize
the file frequently.  Normal IDCAMS EXPORT-IMPORT or REPRO functions
may be used to reorganize and compactify an actively used VSAM archive
cluster.

      Reorganization may also be necessary several times during many
large UNLOADs into a VSAM archive.  You'll usually find that reorgs
will save you a lot of disk space, and will be helpful, especially if
you want a VSAM archive to stay around on disk for some time.


ADDING NOTES.  SPECIAL DOCUMENTATION THAT IS VERY CONVENIENT.

      Any archived item is capable of having NOTEDATA attached to it.
Notes can be added to individual items separately, or they can be
added generically.  Notes may be used to further qualify or clarify
the nature of the items being archived, and they can be of great
convenience to their creator, or to any user of the archive.

      Notes in an archive can be shown with a LIST command, if the
keyword NOTE=YES is used.  NOTE=YES is not the default.

      There is a small amount of learning necessary to use the NOTE
facility, and this concerns the input dataset, where the notes are
fed into The ARCHIVER.

      The note input dataset is an 80-byte card-image dataset, in
which columns 73-80 contain key data for the notes.  Text data
is in columns 1-72.  The key data is used to determine which note
images are appended to which items.  The data for many notes may be
mixed up on one input file, but all is dependent on key values in
columns 73-80.  Blanks in columns 73-80 constitute comments in the
note input data file.

      Let's consider an example.  Suppose the ARCHIVER source pds
has been unloaded on the archive cluster TST.TEST001.ARCHIVE with
the statement:

   UNLOAD ITEM=(*,ARCHIVE,UTILITY,SOURCE),DSN=TSTBSSG.ARCHV402.SOURCE

We want to mark all the resultant items in the archive with copyright
information from the author.  This might be done with the statement:

   ADDNOTE ITEM=(*,ARCHIVE,UTILITY,SOURCE),KEY=ARCHIVER

At this point, we don't know how KEY=ARCHIVER is fed in.  This comes
from the note input file, which is allocated by a ddname, and a
control statement like:

   SET DDN=NOTEFILE

The note file will have the word "ARCHIVER" in columns 73-80, opposite
the statements:

----------------------------------------------------------------------  ARCHIVER
THIS IS A PART OF THE VSAM ARCHIVER PROGRAM, WRITTEN BY RICHARD         ARCHIVER
A. FOCHTMAN, JR. AND COPYRIGHTED 1990.  EXCEPT WHERE NOTED, ALL         ARCHIVER
PARTS OF THE ARCHIVER ARE REENTRANT, REUSABLE, AND REFRESHABLE.         ARCHIVER
----------------------------------------------------------------------  ARCHIVER

All items in the archive which satisfy the addnote item qualifications,
will get the keyed remarks appended to them as notes.  These notes can
be listed by a statement:

   LIST ITEM=(*,ARCHIVE,UTILITY,SOURCE),NOTE=YES

Now the DYNAM program in the ARCHIVER source pds is public domain,
and is therefore not copyrightable.  We can add an additional note
to the DYNAM item, to say that DYNAM is public domain.  Please notice
that adding the additional note does not erase any old notes.  Old
notes must be completely deleted and then replaced.  Let's add the
special note for the public-domain module with the keyword of "DYNAM"
in columns 73-80 of the note input file, so that:

******************************************************************      DYNAM
* THIS PARTICULAR SUBROUTINE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE CBT MODS TAPE *      DYNAM
* AND IS PUBLIC DOMAIN SOFTWARE, NOT SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT.       *      DYNAM
******************************************************************      DYNAM

This note might be added with the control statement:

   ADDNOTE ITEM=(DYNAM,ARCHIVE,UTILITY,SOURCE),KEY=DYNAM

so that the DYNAM item will have a note that reads:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS IS A PART OF THE VSAM ARCHIVER PROGRAM, WRITTEN BY RICHARD
A. FOCHTMAN, JR. AND COPYRIGHTED 1990.  EXCEPT WHERE NOTED, ALL
PARTS OF THE ARCHIVER ARE REENTRANT, REUSABLE, AND REFRESHABLE.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
******************************************************************
* THIS PARTICULAR SUBROUTINE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE CBT MODS TAPE *
* AND IS PUBLIC DOMAIN SOFTWARE, NOT SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT.       *
******************************************************************

      You get the picture.


A FEW "UNOFFICIAL BENCHMARKS".

      I personally spent some hours testing "The ARCHIVER" before
the time of this writing.  I did an "UNLOAD" of 63 system libraries
into a VSAM archive on a work pack.  These included SYS1.LINKLIB on
an XA 2.2.3 system, SYS1.LPALIB, SYS1.NUCLEUS, our company's program
product library, SYS1.MACLIB, AMODGEN, panel libraries, PSF libraries,
and so forth.  There were a total of over 15,000 non-alias items
loaded.  Wall clock time for the whole thing on a heavily loaded 3090
model 180 was about 2 hours and 44 minutes.

      The VSAM ARCHIVE occupied 400 cylinders on a 3380 disk before
it was reorganized, and 200 cylinders after it was reorganized.

      The "LIST" function for all the items in this ARCHIVE was
near-instantaneous, taking 14 wall-clock seconds to list 15,938 items.
"LIST" only has to read the VSAM header records for each item.
There are not too many EXCP's.

      Creating an item-selectable "ARCHIVE EXPORT" tape from this
ARCHIVE took 47 minutes of wall clock time, to 3480 cartridge.  A
TAPEMAP run (File 299 of CBT tape version 321) showed that the
cartridge was almost exactly half full--253 feet was used for the
backup of all these libraries!  A full cartridge has about 500 feet,
as measured by the TAPEMAP program.

      A "LISTT" run to list the contents of the item-selectable
ARCHIVE tape, took about two minutes of wall clock time after the
tape was mounted.  This was a cartridge.

      A "LOADT" was done to restore all LINKLIB load modules from the
item-selectable ARCHIVE tape to a junk load library on a work pack.
This load library restore was followed by a csect compare to the
original SYS1.LINKLIB.  It showed exact comparison and no loss of
members or aliases except for two things which were normal:
different note-list ttrs in the overlay modules, and the restore of
orphaned aliases to non-alias status.  To me, that restore sounds
like a success.

      I restored the archived members of SYS1.FONTLIB (PSF fonts)
from the archive tape to a junk disk copy of the library.  I got
an exact match, and no loss of members.

      Restore of SYS1.MACLIB produced an exact compare.

      This isn't bad.


FUTURES.

      Rick Fochtman is planning a whole series of enhancements for
The ARCHIVER product.  To be fully informed, order new CBT tapes,
look at File 147, and keep in touch with Rick or with me.  We hope
that soon, the CBT Tape itself will be converted to ARCHIVER
item-by-item EXPORT format on tape, because of the great compression
factor, and the uniformity in storing items from diverse sources.

      I hope you found this interesting and useful.  If you use the
CBT tapes, it will definitely be useful.

      Good luck.  See you next month.
