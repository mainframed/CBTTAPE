A TOUR OF THE WORLD THROUGH FULLSCREEN ZAP - PART I.

      One of the most useful single tools in the public domain, for an
MVS systems programmer, is the Fullscreen ZAP program, originally from
UCLA in California.  I have mentioned fullscreen ZAP numerous times in
the history of this column, but from my many "straw polls" of working
systems programmers over the years, I don't think the message has taken
hold as much as it should.  That's the reason for running this series
of at least two parts, to explain the uses of this beautiful program
in some detail.

      Fullscreen ZAP is a nearly complete replacement for IBM's
utility to change data on disk files, known as AMASPZAP or "superzap".
The advantage of Fullscreen ZAP is that it can be used for disk
exploration far more conveniently, allowing you to take a "Tour of
your DASD World".

      Fullscreen ZAP in its current incarnations, allows a system
programmer, with authorization, to easily view and change any record
on a disk pack.  Without authorization, one can do the same thing for
most individual datasets.  In FULLVOL (full volume) mode, ZAP can be
used to CLIP a pack (change its volume id) while it is online, and to
view and zap IPL text or any other "track zero" data.  VTOC access is
also easy and sure.  Unlike its IBM equivalent AMASPZAP or HMASPZAP,
Fullscreen ZAP allows you to see what you're doing every step of the
way and to find what you're looking for, even if you originally
didn't know where it was.

      Fullscreen ZAP has an almost complete tutorial self-contained
in its one load module, consisting of thirteen help screens.  Any time
you need help, you type a question mark "?" or "HELP".  This will
initiate a rotating sequence of displays for all these help screens.
When you've seen what you need, typing a "U" will return you to your
previous work place.

      Our current series on Fullscreen ZAP will consist of at least
two parts, explaining how to use the program.  We shall include some
"war stories" to show you the kind of tight situations this program
could save you from.  Of course, any short series such as ours can't
teach you everything about a powerful multi-use product.  Our aim is
simply to get more people to use Fullscreen ZAP so its benefit for
themselves and their installations can be spread around.


INSTALLATION AND BEGINNINGS.

      Fullscreen ZAP is a single load module.  It is in the public
domain, and its source is readily available on the CBT MVS
Utilities Tape, available from either NaSPA (414) 423-2420, or SPLA
(305) 284-6257.  Versions of Fullscreen ZAP source code can be found
on Files 186 or 134 on the CBT Tape (File 186 preferred), and a load
module created from the source of File 134 can be found on File 135.

      Installation consists of one assembly and linkedit of the load
module.  You can even IEBCOPY the load module from File 135 and use
it immediately.  The source code requires some UCLA macros to assemble
properly.  These are contained on the previously mentioned files, or
on the UCLA file, File 149.  The ZAP load module is a TSO command, and
it is invoked from any library accessible to your TSO session.  See
Figure 1 for a good overview of ZAP command invocation options.

      Let's see how to begin using the ZAP command.  ZAP can be used to
examine, dump, and update in place, any type of sequential, partitioned,
or direct access dataset.  If the user is authorized, ZAP can similarly
manipulate VTOCs, catalogs, VVDSs and components of VSAM datasets.
ZAP is not restricted to load modules only.  But since the updating
of load modules is probably the most frequent use of IBM's AMASPZAP,
we shall begin by showing this use of Fullscreen ZAP, to keep things
familiar.

      In our example, we will look at csect IEBDSCPY of load module
IEBCOPY which is a member of the cataloged copy of SYS1.LINKLIB on
our system.  From TSO Ready, we enter:  "ZAP SYS1.LINKLIB" .  There
will appear a fullscreen display, with the cursor pointing to a command
area.  From the command area, we enter two commands.  The first is:
"MIEBCOPY" (or "member IEBCOPY").  The second is:  "EIEBDSCPY"
(or "entry point IEBDSCPY").  The screen resulting from these commands
is shown in Figure 2.  Decimal 224 bytes in the vicinity of our data
are displayed in hex and in EBCDIC.

      A wedge-shaped character among the hex data, points to our
current location.  This is at the beginning of the csect IEBDSCPY,
or at location +0 within the csect.  We enter the command:  "+212"
in the command area, to relocate us hex 212 further into the data
record of the csect.  This is obviously in the middle of some code.
We may disassemble the code by typing the command:  "DISASM" in the
command area.  The result is now shown in Figure 3.

      At this point, we may choose to change the data or to leave
it alone.  To change the data, we have the subcommand "S" followed
by up to eight hex bytes of new data (without an intervening space).
We can also "OR" the original data data with this new data by using
"O" instead of "S".  We can "AND" that data using "A" instead.  Or we
can "XOR" the data with our hex operand, by using "X" instead.

      If we have decided to keep our changes, we enter the command
"ZAP" in the command area to write our changes in place, back to the
original data block.  We can invoke the "LOG" subcommand, to make a
record of what we've done.  To end the ZAP session, we simply type
the command "END" in the command area.  We may receive a message if
we want to keep the log.  If we say YES, the log is written to
SYSOUT(A).  Otherwise, the log is deleted.  To write the log to a
dataset, that dataset must be pre-allocated to the ddname ZAPLOG.
When we ZAP a load module, the program writes an IDR zap record to
the load module, using our TSO id name to identify the maker of the
change.


USING ZAP FOR ANY ARBITRARY DATASET ON A DISK VOLUME.

      To zap a non-cataloged dataset on a disk volume, enter the ZAP
command with the VTOC dataset name, followed by the keyword:  "VOL()".
See Figure 1 for the format.  For example, if we wanted to look at
the copy of SYS1.LINKLIB on the alternate residence volume called
ALTRES, we need merely enter:  "ZAP SYS1.LINKLIB VOL(ALTRES)".  Then
we proceed as before.

      For non-partitioned datasets, the result of the primary command
will get us directly into the first disk record of the dataset.  That
is also true for partitioned datasets, but the first disk record of a
partitioned dataset is the first block of the directory, and we need
the "M" (and possibly "E") commands to reach what we want subsequently.
In any case, we may position ourselves forward or backward, starting
initially from the beginning of the file.  Please bear in mind that our
use of the term "disk record" or "record" really refers to physical
data blocks on the disk.  ZAP does not do any logical deblocking.

      Two useful commands to know at this point are "L" and "F" which
are "find" commands.  These can be used to search forward from the
current point to find either hex or EBCDIC strings.  The difference
between "L" and "F" is that "L" will not proceed to look past zero
length records or "EOFs", but "F" will look past EOFs.  Both of them
will stop at the end of the dataset extents.  To search for a hex
string, merely enter the string immediately after L or F with no
intervening space.  To look for an EBCDIC string, enclose the string
between slashes after the L or F, with no intervening space.  A "repeat
find" is executed merely by entering the letter "L" or "F" again, by
itself.

      Some uses for "L" or "F":  One obvious one is when you're pointed
to a Format 4 record which is a VTOC header, and you want to find the
subsequent Format 1 record belonging to a dataset on the pack.  Simply
enter "F/dataset.name/" in the command area, and ZAP will get you to
to proper Format 1 record promptly.  This record can then be changed
or even zeroed out, if you want.  A second use is if you want to do
a scan-replace for a string, somewhere within the dataset.  Merely
point to the beginning of the dataset with the "P" command, and then
use the "L" or "F" commands to determine the first location of the
desired string to replace.  Enter an "S" command to replace the string
when you're there.  Then do a repeat find by executing "F" again, and
so on.

      ZAP does not have to be used to make changes, but since it shows
you up to 224 bytes at a time, ZAP is a useful tool for browsing on
disk.  Its many commands for finding strings and moving back and forth
within a dataset, can be employed for the purpose of exploration, as
well as for changing data.  PF8 is like a "Page Down" and PF7 is like a
"Page Up" command within a data block on disk.  "R" will advance one
record; "R+n" will advance n records from the current record.  "B" will
point one record back.  And so on.  The tutorial is very helpful to
show the power of these commands.


FULLVOL .....

      Greg Price of Melbourne, Australia has made ZAP into the Mario
Perillo of the disk pack, by introducing the FULLVOL parameter at ZAP
invocation time.  With the FULLVOL parameter, Fullscreen ZAP allows
you to make a "global tour" of an entire disk pack, as though the whole
pack were one dataset.

      FULLVOL works as follows.  The user simply enters the name
of a dataset on a disk pack, possibly with the VOL() keyword parameter
just to make sure he or she has the volume right.  The ZAP invocation
is followed by the word, "FULLVOL".  For example, to look at the volume
ALTRES, you might enter:  "ZAP SYS1.LINKLIB VOL(ALTRES) FULLVOL".
ZAP then alters the DEB of the dataset SYS1.LINKLIB to pretend that
its extents started at the very beginning of the disk pack and ended
at the very end of the pack.  Actually, ZAP knows that it is in FULLVOL
mode.  When in FULLVOL mode, ZAP shows a volume name at the bottom
of the display, instead of a dataset name that it usually shows there.

      FULLVOL mode has immediate uses.  Record 3 of Track zero of
Cylinder zero is the Disk Id of the volume.  In FULLVOL mode, simply
enter the subcommand, "R+2" and you're there.  See Figure 4 which
displays the disk id of a volume in this way.  The volume id field
of this physical record can be changed in the usual way, to "CLIP"
the pack while it is still online.  You can see everything you're doing.
Then you need merely re-mount the pack, using the new volume id.  It
may be necessary to bring the pack offline and then online before
re-mounting it.

      Another use of FULLVOL mode is to examine IPL text on a volume.
Usually this text begins in Record 5 of Track zero, if it is present
on a volume.  Often, an IPL failure on a new RES pack is caused by
lack of replacement of the old IPL text with new IPL text for the
new operating system release.  With Fullscreen ZAP in FULLVOL mode
there's no guesswork anymore.  Just proceed two records past the
volume id, and see what's there.  The eyecatchers for any IPL text
will stare you right in the face.

      Another exploitation of FULLVOL mode is to scan-replace strings
in a dataset that is enqueued DISP=OLD by a long-running job, but
which is not really active.  Merely determine the CCHHR disk location
of the dataset by using a VTOC map or some other tool, or by exploring
with Fullscreen ZAP itself.  Then get into FULLVOL mode on that pack.
Position yourself to the Cylinder and Track location of the beginning
of the dataset (from your exploration knowledge), and then use the
"F" (or "find") subcommand over and over, as described above.  This
works because you are not really accessing the dataset by its own name.
You are accessing it through the name of another dataset on the pack
that is not currently being enqueued upon, and which allows you to
explore the entire pack at will.  This is slick stuff to know about.


TO BE CONTINUED.

      I hope this is enough to whet your appetite and get you started
exploring the newer versions of Fullscreen ZAP from the CBT Tape.  Next
month, I'll show you some more useful tricks that this tool makes
possible.  Good Luck.  See you soon.

FIGURE 1.  The following is a portion of TSO help for the ZAP command
           written and elucidated by Jeff Broido.  The portion shown
           here illustrates how to invoke ZAP from a TSO session and
           most of the options that can be used at invocation time.


Function

   The ZAP command is used to examine, dump, and update in place any
   type of sequential, partitioned, or direct access dataset.  If the
   user is authorized, ZAP can also similarly manipulate VTOCs,
   catalogs, VVDSs and components of VSAM datasets.

   Any record format is accepted.  This command is the TSO interactive
   equivalent of IBM's service aid AMASPZAP (otherwise known as
   IMASPZAP, HMASPZAP or "Superzap").

Syntax

     ZAP  'DSNAME'  VOLUME('SERIAL')  CRT  NOT3270  TERSE/VERBOSE
           BLKSIZE('BLKSIZE')  NOLOG/LOG  ALLOCDSN('DSNTOALLOC')
           FULLVOL

   Required: 'DSNAME'
   Defaults:  TERSE, NOLOG
              No volume implies a cataloged dataset.
              If you invoke ZAP at a terminal in the 3270 family,
                 CRT is the default.
              BLKSIZE defaults to the blocksize of the dataset.

   Note:  Usage of the ALLOCDSN keyword is required only for the
          'DSNAME' of FORMAT4.DSCB

FIGURE 2.  This is a Fullscreen ZAP screen after two subcommands have
           been entered.  ZAP was originally invoked to get into
           SYS1.LINKLIB to look at csect IEBDSCPY from load module
           IEBCOPY.  "ZAP SYS1.LINKLIB" was entered from TSO Ready
           mode.  Then, the subcommand MIEBCOPY (or "member IEBCOPY")
           was entered from the command area of the ZAP screen.
           Finally, EIEBDSCPY (or "entry point IEBDSCPY") was entered
           in the command area.  The resulting screen is shown below.
           Note two things.  First, the most recently entered command
           is re-shown in the open space two lines below the command
           area.  This command is modifiable and usable if the primary
           command area is left blank.  Second, notice the wedge that
           points to the data at offset +0 of the entry point.  This
           wedge shows the current modifiable area of the data.  A
           command to the command area can modify up to eight bytes
           from the location of the wedge, forward.
