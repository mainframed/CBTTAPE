UNDELETING DATA - PART 2

      Last month, we began to consider the subject of how to
"undelete" data that had been deleted from disk.  We asked the
question:  "If data is deleted from disk and isn't there any more,
how is it possible to get it back?"  The answer is, that often, the
process of deleting disk data only involves removing a pointer to the
data, as opposed to wiping the data off the disk entirely.  If one
can properly restore all the pointers to the data, then one can
recover the data.  The trick is, does one truly know the way the
system is pointing to the data, across changes in the operating system
and in data management from release to release, and from device to
device?

      Life has become more complicated.  System Managed Storage has
introduced additional intricacies into the way disk data is kept track
of.  Several flavors of RAID devices have replaced conventional DASD
partly or completely, in many installations.  These devices differ
greatly in the internals of their workings, and we have to know
whether they will logically behave like "real DASD" or not.  Our
approach, when faced with a tough job of recovering irreplaceable data
that's "still there", is to be clever, to simplify the situation as
much as possible, to keep a clear head that stays open to new evidence
of the truth, and to stick to basics.

      Today, the discussion will concentrate on how to recover data
from a disk dataset which was "deleted" by the system.  Last month, we
covered many basic principles of how data is located on disk, and we
also looked at a few tools that are capable of restoring deleted pds
members.  When restoring a pds member, we bear in mind that the dataset
itself has not disappeared, just a directory entry that points to the
former location of a member, has been wiped out.  A pds directory entry
contains relatively little new data, minimally a member name, and a
relative TTR (track and record) location from the beginning of the
dataset.  This can be automatically scanned for by a program, and
filled in.  Since a new pds member is always written at the end of the
previous data, there is no problem of keeping track of "free space" and
preventing a new member from writing over it.  Now, we're facing what
happens when the entire dataset, pds or otherwise, is gone.  What can
we do to effectively get it back?  All the extent information is gone.
All the DCB information is gone.  We haven't saved the VTOC information
about what the data looks like.  In short, recovering a deleted dataset
is a far tougher problem to tackle.


TOOLS WE'LL NEED

      In this column, I like to write about tools that are available
for everybody to use, no matter how "low budget" your shop is.  I'm
very glad that many such tools are available, and a big "thank you" is
in order, for all the people who contributed to writing and fixing
them.  Most of these tools (at least the ones that don't come from IBM)
may be found on the CBT MVS Utilities Tape, a huge, free, independently
produced collection of "system programmer stuff" which can be obtained
(among other places) from the NaSPA office.  The CBT Tape is updated
quite frequently, and there is also a "CBT Overflow Tape" that contains
a lot of additional public software.  Fairly recent versions of the
CBT MVS Tapes are included on the NaSPA cd-rom, but the tapes
themselves are usually updated quite a few times between editions of
the cd-rom.  Current info about the CBT Tapes is maintained at web
site:   http://members.aol.com/cbttape

      We'll have to set up some tools (or others of equivalent
functionality, if available) from the CBT Tape, in order to attempt an
undelete of a disk dataset.  For relative simplicity, and because of
space considerations here, we'll limit ourselves to talking
specifically about attempting to undelete non-VSAM datasets.  Tools
needed are:  A disk mapping program which shows track extents.  One
example is the IEHMAP program from File 083 of the CBT Tape, or some
of the similar programs which are called MAPDISK.  The Fullscreen ZAP
TSO command (from File 134, load module on File 135) will have to be
run in authorized mode.  To learn how to do "non-invasive private TSO
authorization for sysprogs", see Files 185 and 186 of the CBT Tape.
If module IKJTABLS is run from an authorized STEPLIB, it overrides
(the public) settings in IKJTSOnn of PARMLIB.

      Other helpful tools are the PDS TSO command package from File
182.  If you're licensed for PDS's successor, STARTOOL from Serena,
it's all to the good, but for this job, STARTOOL is useful but not
necessary.  STARTOOL has a facility to format (and change) all the
Format 1 DSCB fields, once a working Format 1 DSCB has been created.
Of course, we'll use ISPF.  And the REVIEW TSO browser from File 134
(load module on File 135) will also be helpful.


WORKING ON A PROBLEM

      We all shudder to think about the scenario:  dataset deleted, no
backup.  It's a pds (source or load module).  For simplicity, it's on a
seldom-used non-SMS pack.  To curtail usage of the pack, you might try
varying it offline to all systems except a test MVS system, or using
some other clever trick as necessary.  If the data was on an
SMS-controlled pack, the pack has to be removed from SMS control.  See
the end of Figure 1 for sample JCL.

      Now, the first thing you have to do is to disable the VTOC
index, if there is one.  For that, you'll have to run an ICKDSF OSVTOC
job (also see Figure 1).  If the VTOC is nearly full, you'll have to
make sure there's room for a few extra Format 5 (free space) entries,
by moving a few datasets to another pack.  Once the VTOC is non-indexed,
we can start work.

      The idea is to take a blank VTOC entry that's all hex zeros
(Format 0 entry), and create a Format 1 VTOC entry that points to the
correct data extents, and behaves "authentically".  After this work is
done, the pack "free space" must be adjusted, so the new "dataset"
we've created will have extents that are marked as allocated.  Finally,
we'll use ISPF 3.2 and other ISPF functions, to look at the new
dataset and see if it behaves as it should.  Then we'll make minor
adjustments as necessary, and copy off the data to another pack, if
we can.

      Our next task is to figure out where the data was.  Initially,
we have to find the first extent.  For a pds, this will be a directory,
and if we see it, we should be able to identify the member names.  If
the member names look like those in the deleted dataset, we've made a
lot of headway.  Deleted datasets leave unoccupied data extents on the
disk pack.  We next have to map the disk pack with a tool that has an
absolute track mapper (we'll use IEHMAP from File 083 of the CBT Tape),
and we'll examine all of the empty extents that look like they are the
proper size.  That is, if we happened to know that the deleted dataset
had a 300-track first extent, we'll look in the IEHMAP report for an
unoccupied extent of 300 tracks, to search first.  Here's where you have
to use your head!

      After we've picked some likely extents where the data might have
been, we need a tool to examine the data that's there.  It's not every
systems programmer who has a tool to look at unallocated data on a disk
pack!  But we have one--it's called UCLA Fullscreen ZAP, as enhanced by
Greg Price, running authorized, in FULLVOL mode.  We can examine all the
data in the entire disk pack with Fullscreen ZAP, and we can go to
absolute cylinder, track, and record locations.

      Here's what we do.  We invoke ZAP in FULLVOL mode by saying:  TSO
ZAP 'FORMAT4.DSCB' VOL(volser) FULLVOL.  This takes us to Track 0,
Record 1 at the very beginning of the pack.  Invoke the "R" subcommand
(go to the next record) of ZAP twice, to bump up to Record 3.  This will
show the pack volser, so we're sure it's the right pack.  Actually, the
pack id shows at the bottom of the ZAP screen.  Then we use the ABS
(go to absolute CCHHR location) subcommand of ZAP to get directly to the
CCHHR location on the pack.  When using ABS, you may have to play with
leading zeros as follows:  Suppose that IEHMAP shows a likely gap
starting at location 05E0.0007.  That's cylinder number X'05E0', track 7
(really one more--numbering starts from zero).  To look there, we enter
ABS0005E00007, give or take a leading 0.  If the old data was there, we
should be looking at Record 1 on the track, an obvious pds directory, so
that we can read the names of the members.  Otherwise, if it's the wrong
place, we'll try the next likely gap (shown by IEHMAP) until we hit
paydirt.  This could take a lot of patience.

      Now that we know where the beginning of the data is, we have to
build a VTOC pointer to it.  This is the tricky part.  We assume that
the VTOC index dataset has been disabled by job OSVTOC (Figure 1), and
therefore, all dataset information is in the VTOC itself.  In the ZAP
command (invoked as before), enter the subcommand VTOCDS4.  This will
get us to the first record (Format 4--VTOC header) in the VTOC.  We
start stepping forward, advancing one record at a time, using the "R"
subcommand repeatedly, until we come to a VTOC record that's all zeros.
Look at the bottom of the screen and make a note of the TTR location of
this record.  We're going to use ZAP to turn this record into a Format 1
VTOC record (DSCB) that points to our deleted data.

      We have to be very careful, when creating a new Format 1 DSCB,
that the system should believe us--every field has to be correctly
entered, with no mistakes.  You can find out the format of a Format 1
DSCB by going to SYS1.MODGEN and assembling the macro IECSDSL1 with
keyword 1 following it.  Each VTOC entry is a keyed record--44 byte
key at the beginning, followed by a 96 byte data area--140 bytes in all.
The records in a VTOC are unblocked.  For some formats, the key is
abbreviated--not all of it is used.  For the Format 1 DSCB, all of the
key, the first 44 bytes, is the dataset name, and blanks (X'40') have
to pad to the end of the 44 bytes.

      I have a limited space to describe a big job, so I've included
Figures 2 and 3, detailing the layout of a Format 1 DSCB for an FB-80
partitioned dataset, as a model.  Figure 2 was created by the FIXPDS
subcommand of the vendor product STARTOOL (from Serena Inc.), which
formats the VTOC entry of the dataset that STARTOOL is pointing to.
Not everybody has STARTOOL, so we'll use Fullscreen ZAP and the DSCB 1
DSECT description as our guide.  Figure 3 shows how the same VTOC
record appears to Fullscreen ZAP.

      You should create your own model "real" VTOC entry as well.  For
example, if the deleted dataset was sequential, look at the VTOC entry
for a similar sequential dataset as your model.  If the deleted dataset
was a load library, look at the VTOC entry for a similar load library
as your model.  You can do this with Fullscreen ZAP itself.  The
Fullscreen ZAP tutorial (subcommand "?") will show you how to print the
current record, or several records.  Point Fullscreen ZAP to the VTOC
entry for your model dataset (one that's similar to the deleted one)
and print its entire record out.

      Now that we're "ready", we have to point to the beginning of the
blank VTOC record (the Format 0) that we've chosen, and we start filling
in the fields.  For this, we use the "S" subcommand of Fullscreen ZAP,
to change the data bytes of the record, up to 8 bytes at a time.  Then
we (hold our breath and) make the changes permanent with ZAP subcommands
as we go.  When all the fields are filled in, we try and access the data
using first, ISPF 3.2 with dataset and volume specification, to see if
ISPF can find the dataset at all.  After fixing any obvious errors by
re-zapping VTOC fields, we can then try to ISPF BROWSE the dataset,
to see if we have the data.  Finally, a good next step would be to try
and copy the data to a new dataset on another pack.  Don't use IEBCOPY
for this, but rather try ISPF 3.3.  ISPF 3.3 will disturb the "from"
data less than IEBCOPY will.  I've had nightmares using IEBCOPY here.

      The new dataset is, of course, uncataloged.  I'd try and copy the
data off and then re-delete the dataset.  This is probably the safest
practice.  You may have to find additional extents for the dataset, and
you'll have to repeat the previous IEHMAP and Fullscreen ZAP "ABS"
searches patiently.  Then you have to fill in "second extent" and
"third extent" fields in the Format 1 VTOC entry.  For more than 3
extents, you'll have to find another blank entry to make a Format 3
DSCB, point to the Format 3 from the Format 1 (the Fullscreen ZAP TTR
display may help you), and you have to correctly make a new Format 3
entry as well.  A format 3 DSCB will hold up to 13 additional extent
descriptions, from the fourth extent, to the sixteenth.  Assemble
IECSDSL1 3, look at a model, and keep on trying until all the missing
data has been recovered.  Then copy it off, to save it.  I talked
last month about how to re-adjust the pack's free space.

      I hope this article will inform you about how tough it is to
recover a deleted dataset, and how important it is not to get to this
point.  If you can devise a way to keep records of all your VTOC
entries for all your packs, the potential job of recovering will be
much easier.  Even if you can IEHMAP all your packs once a week
(IEHMAP is very quick), this will be of invaluable help.  Meanwhile,
keep your thinking caps on!  See you next month.

Figure 1.   JOBS YOU'LL NEED  -  A quick reference

         These are jobs to un-index the VTOC and re-index the VTOC of
         a pack.  It is assumed that the pack was originally indexed,
         and we do not want to use the index dataset while zapping
         VTOC entries.  When the VTOC is un-indexed, only the VTOC
         itself has meaningful information about the datasets on a
         pack.  The index is then not used.  Re-indexing the pack
         will have the effect of reorganizing the VTOC index and
         recalculating the pack's free space.  At bottom is a DFDSS
         job to remove an SMS volume from SMS control.  After the
         DFDSS job is complete, you have to remove the volume from
         the storage group.  Then you can access the datasets (and
         curtail activity on that volume at the same time).

Figure 2.   STARTOOL'S LAYOUT OF A FORMAT 1 DSCB FOR A PDS

            This figure will help us visualize the layout of a
            140-byte VTOC Dataset Description entry (Format 1).

            The data description can also be found by assembling
            the macro IECSDSL1 1 from SYS1.MODGEN, but STARTOOL
            shows, in addition, what the data actually looks like.
            Figure 3 shows how Fullscreen ZAP views this same data.

            The dataset is 80 byte, fixed blocked card-image format.
