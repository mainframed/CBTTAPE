IEHMAP, AND OTHER STORIES.

      I have a bunch of things to say today.  I hope they'll be
helpful to you, or at least they should set you thinking.  We
systems programmers are living in a changing world, and probably many
of us are rethinking where we'll fit--where our niche will be in the
future.  Repositioning is probably on the minds of most of us, either
in the back of our mind, or in the front.

      To my thinking, MVS isn't going away at this point.  It's just
too high-powered and does too much to be replaced by anything else.
Although other systems are chipping away at its low end, MVS, on the
large IBM mainframes, is extremely powerful and getting more so.  IBM
is a huge company even after its own "downsizing" process.  The
computing requirements of large installations are still best met by
MVS, which is quite economical when it's called upon to do a lot of
work.

      So in the forseeable future, MVS will have to be supported.
Perhaps not by so many people, but there'll still be a job market for
many of us.  Nevertheless, while we are personally rethinking our
future directions, we have to keep in mind the possibility of growing
into some new skills.

      One possible direction is in software development.  In many shops,
the writing of code is being lifted away from the responsibilities of
the average MVS systems programmer, who is spending more time installing
someone else's code.  Nevertheless, if a person manages to accumulate
skills in manipulating components of the operating system through
assembler language, there are jobs available to write "code for the
masses" at many software houses.

      Again, this is not for everyone.  Many people, justifiably,
might want to learn a completely different and marketable skill.  This
suggestion is only for someone who wants to make a commitment in the
direction of writing MVS software, or for someone who wants to stay in
the systems programming field at an installation to become more
skilled.  However, the ironic question arises:  In our new world of
mostly OCO packaged software, how is it possible to develop your
assembler programming skills from the MVS system programmer's job
platform?

      I'll answer this as follows:  It's a multi-pronged effort.
First, you might try to study your installation's system and JES exits,
for the purpose of understanding exactly what they do and how they do
it.  Second and far more important, there are tremendous storehouses of
MVS coding examples, free for the looking.  These begin with the CBT
MVS Utilities Tape, which can be ordered through NaSPA.  The CBT Tape
not only contains a huge number of working programs to use and study,
but it contains a pointer to other sources of such code through file
071, which shows you what's contained on many other public tapes.

      Third, there is a marvelous book which is far too under-used for
its immense value.  This book literally takes us to school.  It
directly and simply teaches us most of the advanced skills we have to
know in assembler programming for the operating system.  Among many
other topics, this book explains:  macro writing, channel programming,
dynamic allocation in assembler programs, many ways of accessing a
pds, issuing operator commands from a program, abend recovery using
SPIE, ESPIE, STAE and ESTAE methods, writing SVC routines, and almost
any other programming principle you'd like to know.  It's a big book.
It's title is: "Advanced Assembler Language and MVS Interfaces" by
Carmine Cannatello, and it's published by John Wiley and Sons in New
York City.  You can call Diane Cerra at 212-850-6660, to order.

      Carmine Cannatello's book is an unbeatable combination with
the CBT Tape, when both are taken together.  In fact, the CBT Tape
now contains all the coding examples from Carmine's book in machine-
readable form, on file 069.  How can you use this combination?  You can
look at any program on the CBT tape that you want to study.  Then you
can study the relevant parts of Carmine's book, where he teaches you
the coding principles involved.  Fantastic.  Too bad nobody knows
about this.  You can be the first on your block to get on the
bandwagon.

      After you're really skilled, you can try disassembling and
studying pieces of system code.  I'm not telling anyone to violate
licensing agreements.  I'm just suggesting that there is a large
opportunity for permissibly and legitimately obtaining great skill
and benefit through the use of disassemblers.  We'll leave that
study for a future column.  But we are about to reap enormous reward
from someone else's expert use of disassembly.  The next story
follows.


IEHMAP.

      IEHMAP is mostly a VTOC and catalog listing tool, with many
options and facets.  To anyone who's an oldtimer in this field, IEHMAP
is an old program.  In fact, its 50-page user manual bears the date,
October 1975.  This belies the truth.  IEHMAP has been thoroughly
modernized and revamped by Guy Albertelli, who works for B.F.
Goodrich in Brecksville, Ohio.  The modernization process was not
so simple.  IEHMAP was only available in object code.  Guy Albertelli
disassembled some of its modules, and worked from there.

      IEHMAP had been available (on the older CBT Tapes) in object
decks only, but it was free public code.  After his disassembly
process, Guy Albertelli made some massive updates at the source level.
As a result, IEHMAP is now a very speedy program, using CVAF access to
VTOCs.  I can testify that I was able to map 250 volumes, mostly 3390
models 2 and 3 and some 3380K's, using the new IEHMAP, in eight minutes
and change, on our large ES/9000 processor.  The most complicated
listing of a single volume takes a small fraction of one minute.
That's pretty darn fast.  This new version of IEHMAP is available on
CBT Tape Version 337 or later, file 083.  If you have an older CBT
Tape, you should order a new one.

      To run IEHMAP, there's only one piece of basic JCL, which is
illustrated in Figure 1.  The important part of running IEHMAP is in
the control cards.  This is true because in Guy Albertelli's version,
you do not have to specify a special DDNAME for each volume allocated.
Guy's version of IEHMAP will dynamically allocate a DDNAME pointing to
each volume that is accessed.

      To learn about IEHMAP's control cards, you should print out its
manual, called $MAPDOC.  You should also print Guy Albertelli's update
notes, called $DOC390.  Both of these are members of the pds which
comes from CBT Tape File 083.  The control cards I want to discuss
are:  NAME, MAP, CATLG and ATTRIB.  Other related control cards are
described in the $MAPDOC document.  I would strongly advise reading
Guy Albertelli's detailed caveats in the $DOC390 document.  Do not try
and use some of the more tricky functions of IEHMAP unless you have a
spare scrap volume to play with.  It's best to stick to the simpler
functions that we'll describe now.

      One more item before we start.  Guy Albertelli introduced the
VSAM and ICF Catalog support to IEHMAP.  Reading an ICF/VSAM catalog
requires APF authorization for IEHMAP, which wasn't required before.
That's because the reading of an ICF or VSAM catalog requires either
entry of a password by the operator (each time), or JFCB password
bypass, which allows a straightforward reading of the catalog without
entering any passwords.  The setting of the JFCB password bypass bit
during catalog OPEN, is what requires running in KEY 0, and hence the
authorization.  Functions of IEHMAP which don't require the catalog
read, will probably work if the program is not being run authorized.
Please be aware of this consideration.

      Now to the meat.  Running IEHMAP with the simple control card of
"NAME VOL=volser" will produce an alphabetical listing of all datasets
on the disk pack.  If "MAP" is used as a control card instead of
"NAME", then a track map of all datasets and extents sorted by CCHHR,
is produced in addition to the alphabetical listing of datasets.  MAP
is probably the most common keyword that you'll use.  Individual free
extents are shown in the track map as "AVAILABLE".  The "CATLG
VOL=catvol,CNAME=catalog.name" control card will list the entire
contents of a catalog, which could be VSAM or ICF.  Finally, the
"ATTRIB VOL=volser" will list all members of partitioned datasets on a
volume, including their linkedit attributes (if load modules) and/or
SSI values.  See Figure 2 for exact coding of some of these control
cards.  IEHMAP also provides extensive filtering capability to limit
these listings.  These capabilities are described in detail in the
$MAPDOC document.

      At the very least, you should use IEHMAP to map disk volumes,
using the "MAP VOL=volser" control cards.  This JCL should become a
part of every systems programmer's stock in trade.  And IEHMAP is
very, very fast.  See Figures 3, 4, and 5 for an illustration of
these most commonly used IEHMAP functions.

      Space is running out now, and I'll have to postpone telling
more "stories" until next time.  Please play with this new version
of IEHMAP.  You'll be pleasantly surprised at its speed and the
detail in its reports.  Most people will probably scratch their
heads and ask how IEHMAP can do so much, so fast.

      Good luck and much success in all your endeavors.  See you
next time.

            the significant variations are in the choice of control

Figure 2.   A few of the control cards available in IEHMAP.

            NAME    - Produces an alphabetical dataset listing for
                      a disk pack.

            MAP     - Produces an alphabetical dataset listing for
                      a disk pack, plus an extent list for the pack,
                      sorted by CCHHR and showing free space extents.

            CATLG   - Lists the entries of a CVOL, a VSAM catalog,
                      or an ICF catalog.  For VSAM or ICF catalogs,
                      the CNAME keyword must name the catalog, and
                      the VOL keyword must name the volume containing
                      the catalog.

            ATTRIB  - Lists the members of partitioned datasets on
                      the given volume, showing directory entry
                      information for the members.

            IEHMAP is very fast, and these results are obtained
            extremely quickly.
