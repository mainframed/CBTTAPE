PUTTING YOUR TOOLS TOGETHER - PART II.

      Last month, we began a "miniseries" with the emphasis upon
consolidating your tools.  It's important to possess tools.  It's
just as important to mobilize those tools quickly when you have a
problem to solve.

      Much of a system programmer's wasted time comes from the
following scenario:  You are solving half a problem with one tool.
In order to go further, you have to use another tool that has its
own different environment.  Possibly the first tool is online, a TSO
command.  The second tool can only be run easily via a batch job.
There are setup delays, possibly of several minutes, in between.  It
would certainly be better if the two parts of the solution were
brought closer together.

      As we detailed last month, a powerful way to bring tools
closer to the programmer is ISPF command table customization.  If an
application can be invoked instantly through the execution of a single
command, much of a user's time is saved by eliminating complicated
setups.  This month, we'll go to the second stage and talk about some
experiences using a "tool package".  In a tool package, a large number
of utility functions are available within a single environment, to
throw a great variety of fixup and diagnosis aids at one problem.

      Most tool packages are vendor products.  The format of this
column dictates that I not get "political".  I want the largest group
of readers possible to get a large amount of information they can use
right now, through the material they read here.  I don't want to push
one vendor's product over another, because many MVS sites aren't
licensed for a particular vendor's product.  We would like all MVS
sites to gain good benefit from what is written here, not only those
licensed for a particular product.

      On the other hand, leaving out any mention of tool packages
would be too great a loss.  With the tool packages I use, I am
probably four times more efficient time-wise than the average systems
programmer.  My personal experience in this area is just too important
to skip over.  But my own favorite tool package has two versions--a
free public version that any shop can install, and a vendor version
that is more than twice as powerful.  By using this pair of tool
packages as an illustration, we can show the benefits to be gained,
and at the same time make it possible for any shop to put much of this
knowledge into actual practice.

      I am using PDSTOOLS (formerly PDS/E Sysprog Utilites) from Serena
International as my tool package example here.  The reason is twofold.
First, I have extensive experience over a period of seven years in
using that product.  PDSTOOLS is the cornerstone of my own efficiency
as an MVS systems programmer.  I use PDSTOOLS during 95 percent of my
working day.  Second, there exists a more primitive free version
called PDS version 8.4 that is on the CBT MVS Tape (File 182)
obtainable from Naspa (414-423-2420) or from SPLA (305-284-6257).  We
thus have an opportunity for everyone in any MVS shop to try what
we're talking about for themselves.

      There's one more thing I have to say before we go to specific
details.  Having more than one tool package is not always redundant.
In fact it can be very effective for systems programmers, because
several different tool packages can often be made to work efficiently
together.  This is in line with our thinking here.  Please refer to a
relevant article in the March 1992 issue of "Technical Support" called
"Software Integration Improves Productivity and Performance" by Jeff
Furman.  That entire article shows how various combinations of vendor
tool packages add up to a greater whole than the sum of their separate
parts.


WHERE A TOOL PACKAGE SPEEDS THINGS.

      A tool package like PDSTOOLS saves time in two ways.  First, it
duplicates functions available more awkwardly elsewhere.  For example,
with PDSTOOLS it is trivial to create any number of aliases for a pds
member (source or load module).  If it is necessary to create an alias
for a load module, the last thing you want to do is to fool with the
linkage editor.  Just enter a command and you're done.  PDSTOOLS gives
that to you.  There's no anguish--just a very simple operation:
"ALIAS memname aliasnme".

      The second thing that a package like PDSTOOLS will do is to supply
function that is not available elsewhere.  Suppose that you really have
to use the linkage editor in adding an alias name to an existing load
module.  PDSTOOLS will effortlessly generate accurate re-linkedit JCL
from an existing load module in a library.  That functionality is not
readily available elsewhere.  PDSTOOLS will effortlessly write the
generated JCL to a dataset, where you can edit it and add control cards
to your heart's content.  You don't have to use the linkage editor
manual to reconstruct your original module.  It's easy with PDSTOOLS
to obtain linkage editor control cards that preserve your module in a
new pass through the linkage editor.

      In a day's work, the result of using PDSTOOLS is the saving of
large amounts of time and anguish while doing simple repetitive
processes.  PDSTOOLS even eliminates the repetition entirely
sometimes.  Through the concept of "member groups" in place of single
members, PDSTOOLS allows one command to operate the same way at
assembler speed, over a carefully selected group of many pds members.
The result is often twenty- or thirty-fold time savings!  You see that
a package like this pays for itself very quickly.

      As impressive as these illustrations are, they truly do not even
begin to show the main advantage of PDSTOOLS in time saving.  The tool
package PDSTOOLS enables a system programmer to literally throw
hundreds of tools at one problem in one place, dealing with many
datasets.  Judicious entries to your ISPF command tables, as illustrated
last month, allow even more tools to be brought into juxtaposition with
the many integrated activities going on in PDSTOOLS alone.  When you
get good at this stuff, you'll be a wonder of wonders in your shop
much of the time.

      We'll present a large example to give a hint at this.  I must
emphasize that you're only getting a small taste.  I can easily talk
for two weeks of eight-hour days on this subject without much
repetition.  A tool package like PDSTOOLS is really essential.  It
opens up a new world for you.


PUTTING THE TOOL PACKAGE TO USE.

      Let's say we've got some trouble with our working copy of
SYS1.LINKLIB which, of course, is in the system linklist.  We're
getting S806 abends for some of the modules on our XA or ESA system.
We're pretty sure that the members are there, even though the S806
abend seems to tell us that they're not there.  The first thing to
try, of course, is the operator command:  "F LLA,REFRESH".  If the
reason for not finding the modules is that LLA doesn't know about
them, this will cure the problem.

      Suppose that doesn't work.  Trying to execute the programs still
results in the S806 abend.  If you have PDSTOOLS, there are some obvious
paths to follow.

      The first thing to try is to get into the dataset by entering
the TSO command:  "PDSTOOLS SYS1.LINKLIB".  If you have the free PDS
package, you enter:  "PDS SYS1.LINKLIB".  From now on, I'll assume
you have the vendor package.  If our actions can't be done with the
free package, I'll tell you so.  Once you're in PDSTOOLS pointing to
the dataset, enter the subcommand:  "USAGE ALL " or "U A".  You'll see
a detailed display of the characteristics of your copy of SYS1.LINKLIB,
including the number of its extents.  If the secondary extent size is
nonzero and there are secondary extents present, there is a possibility
that an extent was added after IPL.  Since the extents of the linklist
datasets are made known to the system only at IPL time, the system will
not know about any modules found in a new secondary extent of
SYS1.LINKLIB and you'll get a S806 abend if you try to execute them.

      See Figure 1 which shows the output of "USAGE ALL".  Among the
many things you'll see, there is a CCHHR and TTR description of the
dataset's extents.  Then type "MEMLIST : " which means, "take a member
list of all the dataset's members.  Type "RIGHT" or PF11 to get the
alternate display which lists all the member TTR starting locations.
Finally type:  "SORT TTR" which will sort the full member list in TTR
order.  Type "U A" again to redisplay the TTRs of the newest extents.
Write them down.  Then type MEMLIST again to redisplay the sorted
list of members.  By going down toward the bottom of the sorted member
list, you can easily spot which members are in the second, third, or
fourth extents.  If the members in the last extent are the same ones
getting the S806 abends, we're getting warm.  Confirmation can be done
as follows:  Run the failing job with a STEPLIB DD card pointing to
SYS1.LINKLIB.  STEPLIB does a directory search for the module, and
bypasses the linklist search.  If the STEPLIB search works, circumvent
the problem using the STEPLIB DD card, until you do an IPL to inform
the system of the new linklist extents.

      Suppose we still have trouble.  With the PDSTOOLS product at the
Release 3.1.0 level or higher, we can issue:  "FINDMOD modulnam" from
the command line, and PDSTOOLS will issue its own module searches and
display the results.  The FINDMOD command of PDSTOOLS will display all
places on the working system where the module is found, or it will tell
us that it is not found.  If we want to look at all the found versions
of the module, we issue:  "FINDMOD modulnam CHANGE LIB(1)" to go to the
library of first occurrence, or LIB(2) to go to the library of second
occurrence, and so on.  A MEMLIST display on the module name in the new
library will show the linkedit date and some other telltale
characteristics of that version of the module.  An ATTRIBute display on
the module will show linkedit attributes RENT or REUS and so forth,
displaying the size and entry point  of the module also.  Entering
"HISTORY modulnam" will display the linkedit IDR records of all the
CSECTs and optionally, will display the assembler or compiler IDR
records.  The DISASM command will disassemble the module quickly.  The
"DISASM modulnam REASM" command will disassemble the module in
re-assemblable format, wrapping correct assembly and linkedit JCL
around the disassembled source code.

      Getting back to our problem, the VERIFY command against our
module will show us any abnormalities or errors in the structure of the
module, or in its ability to be fetched.  A VERIFY command against all
members of the load library will reveal overall weaknesses in the
library.  This "VERIFY : " command against the whole library will
show all the modules having bad internal structure.  After running all
these tests, we can usually zero in on the source of the difficulty.

      You can now see how PDSTOOLS can throw dozens of different
actions, tools and tests against a single library, or a single module
name.  These things can all be done in a very few minutes.  Hundreds
of other dataset-related problems can be similarly dispatched in very
short order.  This is what I'm trying to show; this is the advantage
of having and using a top-notch tool package.

      In truth, PDSTOOLS possesses more than 1500 individual utility
functions that can be applied to a great variety of common and uncommon
problems.  The clarity of proof that a problem situation exists is often
unparalleled.  PDSTOOLS will often demonstrate the existence and cause
of a bad situation beyond all doubt.  PDSTOOLS can often fix the
problem also.

      A simple case of this is when a load module which is not
re-entrant was linkedited by mistake with the RENT attribute.  As a
result, it does not function properly when it is executed.  The
ATTRIB command of PDSTOOLS will reveal the existence of the problem
with its display.  But the "ATTRIB modulnam NORENT NOREUS" command
will actually remove the re-entrancy and reusability attributes from
the directory entry of the load module, thereby curing the problem in
an instant by fixing the linkedit mistake.

      I don't have space to say any more now, but I hope that I've
shown a tiny bit of the usefulness of a tool package.  If you're
stimulated to try PDS 8.4, PDSTOOLS, or any other tool package, I've
accomplished my purpose here.  Good luck and much success.  I'll be
seeing you next month.

FIGURE 1.   PDSTOOLS "USAGE ALL" display, to show the structure and
            characteristics of a dataset, based on the contents of its
            VTOC entry, or FORMAT 1 DSCB.  Please note the wealth of
            detail.  This command can be shortened if "USAGE" is
            entered without any parameters.  In that case the 'extent'
            detail, starting with the PDS184I messages, is left out.
            Note that in the case of a dataset having more than 3
            extents, when it is necessary to have a FORMAT 3 DSCB to
            describe the additional extents, PDSTOOLS will format this
            FORMAT 3 DSCB for you also.  All this material can be
            written out from the PDSTOOLS log, to a disk file or a
            SYSOUT class of your choice.

FIGURE 2.   PDSTOOLS display of several commands that can be brought
            to bear on one load module, or one library.  The point is
            that a tool package such as PDSTOOLS can integrate dozens
            of functions, and focus them on one problem area.  Thus it
            is an excellent means of "putting your tools together".

            Illustrated is the load module ACCOUNT from SYS1.LINKLIB.
            The PDSTOOLS subcommands ATTRIB, HISTORY, and VERIFY are
            shown, as well as a VERIFY run on the entire SYS1.LINKLIB
            load library.  There are literally dozens of other functions
            within PDSTOOLS which can be used to investigate a single
            load module, or the entire library.
