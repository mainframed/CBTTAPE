PUTTING YOUR TOOLS TOGETHER - PART III.

      This month we are concluding a series that I hope is helpful to
all of you.  The idea is to present ways of getting more of your tools
into easier reach.

      The first part of this series dealt with customizing your ISPF
command tables, which has the effect of making numerous applications
instantly and recursively available for your use.  I think that the
ISPF command table presents the greatest single opportunity for
bringing tools closer together.  Last month we presented the second
installment, which dealt with tool packages.  These are integrated
tool kit software packages that combine a large number of utility
functions in one place.  With the use of one or more tool packages, a
great number of your tools are already consolidated, making it easy to
bring many different utility functions to bear on your current single
problem.

      This month, in concluding the series, we'll briefly talk about
three areas:  ISPF edit macros, handy TSO commands, and obtaining
"private" APF authorization for your TSO commands.  Being able to run
certain commands "authorized" can often be a big time saver.  Your own
"personal" APF authorization will definitely be useful if you are the
system doctor in your shop.


ISPF EDIT MACROS.

      Most of us spent much of our day using the ISPF/PDF editor.
We edit JCL, data files, and program source.  The editor as supplied
by IBM contains numerous primary commands as well as line commands.
Because most of us have spent a lot of time with the editor, we have
become familiar with a large number of its commands and we use them
often.

      Starting with ISPF Version 2 and continuing with Version 3,
IBM has supplied an add-on to the editor which assists the user
enormously.  This is the edit macro feature.  Edit macros are a
programmable interface to the commands of the ISPF editor.  By invoking
an edit macro with one command (or a pfkey), complicated and repeatable
manipulations can be instantly accomplished.  You just have to take the
time to write the macro, or to learn to use somebody else's macro.

      Edit macros can be either clists, REXX execs, or programs.  Most
of the edit macros you'll come across are clists or REXX execs.
Program macros can be written in any of several languages; assembler,
COBOL, and PL/I are among them.  Edit macros that are clists or REXX
execs are invoked the same way that clists are, except that they only
work while you're editing a file or a pds member.  Program macros
aren't invoked that way.  If you want to run a program macro, you have
to precede its name with an exclamation point.

      For example, if you have a program macro called JCLFLOW, which
makes the ddnames in your JCL more orderly, you invoke the macro by
typing the command !JCLFLOW while editing your JCL.  JCLFLOW, which
I've aliased as JF, can be found on the CBT MVS Tape on File 047.  It
comes from Jim Lane, a system programmer from Toronto.  See Figure 1
for "before" and "after" pictures of JCLFLOW invocation.  I use
JCLFLOW to assist me while I'm writing or fixing JCL for jobs or procs.
It's quick and very helpful to create room when I'm adding new DD card
parameters.

      A nice collection of clist edit macros comes from Paul Davis,
formerly of Houston, Texas, who now lives in Colorado.  This collection
is found on File 095 of the CBT MVS Tape.  You can order the CBT Tape
either from NaSPA (414-423-2420) or from SPLA (305-284-6257) at the
University of Miami in Florida.  Many of the NaSPA chapters give tapes
out for free at their meetings (mine does).  It pays to go to chapter
meetings if you're fortunate enough to have a chapter nearby.

      There isn't enough space to show in detail how these edit macros
can help you, but I've included Paul's table of contents in Figure 2.
From Figure 2, you can get a good idea of the kind of jobs edit macros
will do, and how powerful they can be.  Of course, the possibilites
inherent in the edit macro facility are almost limitless, and they offer
an excellent opportunity for study and exploitation.  The rest is up to
you.  IBM's edit macro manual is called "ISPF/PDF Edit and Edit Macros",
number SC34-4138 in ISPF Version 3.


TSO COMMANDS.

      TSO commands are your one-stroke servants.  If you've made a
collection of good commands accessible to your TSO session, you've
shortened your daily work considerably.  Many files on the CBT Tape
contain big collections of useful TSO commands.  You might start
with Files 300, 270, and 134.

      I recommend allocating one pfkey in ISPF for the name "TSO".
This may be done in ISPF option 0.3.  The reason is that TSO commands
may be executed from the ISPF command line by prefixing them with the
word, TSO.  When you type a TSO command on an ISPF command line and
you have a "TSO" pfkey, pressing that key will prefix the typed
command with the name "TSO" and will execute it as though you typed
the word "TSO" before it.  If you execute TSO commands often while in
ISPF, it saves a lot of time to have such a designated pfkey.


AUTHORIZING TSO COMMANDS FOR YOUR PERSONAL USE.

      Some of the TSO commands which you, as a system specialist, may
need to use, have to run APF authorized under TSO.  It will save you
much time and grief to use commands such as CDSCB (change the DSCB) in
doing dataset management, for example.  CDSCB was written by Bill
Godfrey, and is found on File 300 of the CBT Tape along with hundreds
of other useful TSO commands that you can learn.  As the system doctor
of your installation, you will want to authorize some commands for
your own use, without granting that ability to the general public.

      There are three requisites for APF authorization of a program
under TSO.  These are:  The program has to reside in an APF authorized
load library.  Load library authorization is controlled by a table
whose virtual address is found in the CVT at label CVTAUTHL.  This
table is loaded at IPL time from an IEAAPFnn member of SYS1.PARMLIB.
Next, the program itself has to be linkedited with the authorization
attribute set on in its directory entry.  That is done by the linkage
editor if the control statement "SETCODE AC(1)" was coded at linkedit
time.  Finally, if the program is to be run from TSO, its name must
appear in one of several tables designated for permitting authorized
programs to be run under TSO.

      Older versions of TSO and TSO/E contained these tables in one of
the terminal monitor load modules, IKJEFT02.  The CSECT containing the
list of authorized TSO commands is called IKJEFTE2, and the CSECT of
authorized called programs is called IKJEFTE8.  IKJEFT02 and its
numerous aliases reside normally in SYS1.LPALIB.  The later versions
of TSO/E have split these tables off into a separate module called
IKJTABLS.  IKJTABLS is still in SYS1.LPALIB.  At those levels of
TSO/E, IKJEFTE2 and IKJEFTE8 are not a part of IKJEFT02 any more,
but are part of IKJTABLS.  IKJTABLS at these levels does not contain
any executable code, it only contains four different tables of program
names under four separate CSECTS.  Each table of names serves a
different purpose.  See IBM's "TSO/E Customization" manual for more
details.  See Figure 3 for a CSECT map of IKJTABLS.

      Most installations now put their authorized TSO commands and
programs called from TSO into a SYS1.PARMLIB member called IKJTSOnn.
These entries in the PARMLIB member allow authorization of programs
and commands under TSO for the entire installation.  Most installations
do not bother using IKJTABLS any more.  However, the designers of TSO/E
have kept the module IKJTABLS available and usable.  For our purposes,
we can take great advantage of this fact.

      An authorized library run as a STEPLIB in the TSO logon procedure
will allow the system doctor to get all the power he or she needs.  The
particular installation will not want to allow this for ordinary TSO
users.  Our trick is to make a copy of the IKJTABLS module with all its
aliases, expand the number of its entries greatly through reassembly
and re-linkediting, copy all the entries found in IKJTSOnn to these
tables, add all the additional program names you want, and put the
resulting IKJTABLS load module and aliases into your authorized STEPLIB.
That will override the installation's PARMLIB member IKJTSOnn, just
for you.  This works because the STEPLIB programs are executed ahead
of programs in the LPA list, and ahead of the incore tables created
from IKJTSOnn.

      If you set this up, you'll never again complain of not being
able to run a program authorized under TSO.  Of course, having a general
TSO user doing that is not to be taken lightly.  Your installation's
security procedures will probably want to disallow it for most people.
But the facility is there if you yourself, and the MVS group, need it.

      I have left out much detail from this installment because of
space requirements.  But there is gold and riches in what I have
said.  The jewels have to be mined.  That must be done through your
own personal effort.  Good luck and much success.  See you next month.

            File 047 of the CBT MVS Tape.  Notice that the macro
            reads the JCL above and only affects DD cards.  The
            result of the macro is the JCL below.  Execution time

            You can get a good idea of the power of edit macros in
            shortening your work, by looking through this list.

        This is a collection of various edit macros that may be
        somewhat useful at your installation.  Some of them are my
        original, and others are from other SHARE users.  All of them
        work at this site.  Some may need to be modified to work at
        your site.  To use them you will need to have ISPF 2.2 or
        later and TSO/E Rel 3 or later.
