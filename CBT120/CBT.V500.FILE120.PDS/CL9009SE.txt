      This month, I'd like to continue with last month's topic that
we had to split between two issues.  I personally do not like to split
a topic.  Our column has two specific goals at all times.  I feel that
a division of one topic into two pieces must not interfere with these
two central goals that we have set.

      First goal:  this column is here to provide self-contained
solutions to specific problems.  If a reader picks up an issue of the
magazine that has the second installment of a split, there is the
danger that he or she might be missing essential information that was
in the first installment.  Thus, our objective of providing "the
practical and whole solution" would not be achieved properly.  I
believe that in our specific case, we have minimized this problem.

      The second goal of the column is:  THAT ANY SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER
FROM ANY MVS SHOP SHOULD BE ABLE TO GAIN SOMETHING FROM LOOKING AT THIS
"MVS TOOLS" COLUMN, ANY MONTH.  To illustrate, this goal made a
difference during the month we talked about spool browsing tools.  I
mentioned SDSF and the QUEUE and IOF products for JES2, but our goal
required that we shouldn't exclude programmers from the JES3 shops.
Therefore I was forced to write about the magnificent JES3 "Spool
Display Facility" product, which is available for FREE on the JES3
SHARE Tape (from Alan Field, (612) 828-4979.)  Sticking to this
requirement as much as possible, is part of our public service.

      Now, let's return to the topic at hand.  We began last month,
to explain how to regress a "too high" version of VTAM from our new
CBIPO-generated MVS/XA 2.2.3 system.  Our shop needed to use the
version of VTAM that we had on our old MVS/370 1.3.5 system.  We knew,
by asking IBM, that the older version would also run under XA 2.2.3.
We were not willing to pay the extra money for a newer version of
VTAM.  IBM refused to ship us the older VTAM with the CBIPO.  The
older VTAM was still supported, however.

      Our problem was to first install the CBIPO with a newer VTAM
on free trial, and then remove the new VTAM to replace it with the
VTAM version from our old MVS/370 system.

      Why would a programmer at a "richer" shop want to know this
stuff?  I've chosen to write about such SMP activity, because I feel
that the skills required in performing this action are a necessary
part of the MVS system programmer's repertoire.  One has to know how
different components interface with the operating system as a whole.
The activity of "regressing releases" of a component such as VTAM
lends invaluable insight into its interfacing structure.  Regressing
is a better learning experience than merely installing, SIMPLY BECAUSE
IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC, the way a straight install would be.  One learns
a lot more through the manual intervention.

      At this point we should state that a knowledgeable reader of
EITHER last month's or this month's issue can actually accomplish the
entire procedure by himself.  A reader of last month's installment
could see THE ENTIRE PROCEDURE IN OUTLINE FORM, BY LOOKING AT THE
SIDEBAR ILLUSTRATION.  The text of last month's column served to
provide an explanation of the underlying fundamental principles.  THE
SAME SIDEBAR ILLUSTRATION IS ALSO PRINTED THIS MONTH, but the
accompanying text and further figures will explain specific details of
the procedure, plus the few "gotchas" to watch for in carrying it out.
The complete story is told in both issues taken together, but a full
outline of steps has been included in either issue separately.

      So, we can resume our discussion where we left it last time.


WHAT HAD TO BE DONE?

      We start our scene with two sets of SMP/E zones and the libraries
they control.  One set is our old MVS/370 system, and the other set is
our new MVS/XA CBIPO-installed system.  VTAM 2.2 (fmid HVT2202) is
installed on the MVS/370 system.  VTAM 3.2 (fmids HVT3205 and JVT3215)
is installed on the MVS/XA system.  Our job is to transplant VTAM 2.2
from the MVS/370 system to the MVS/XA system after having gotten rid
of VTAM 3.2 first.

      We stated last time that there are physical modules belonging
to each VTAM version.  These are stored in libraries.  There are
corresponding SMP/E control entries in the SMP/E VSAM "zones".  Their
purpose is to account for each piece, or element, of the VTAM
component in each SMP environment.  Both the physical VTAM modules and
their SMP/E control counterparts must be faithfully transplanted from
the 370 environment to the XA environment.  We must make sure that
VTAM 2.2 will work as IBM designed it to work under XA, and its SMP/E
control entries appear as though they were installed together with XA.

      The process is complicated by the fact that VTAM is not a
stand-alone product; it interfaces with other components of the
operating system.  Those components, and the way they fit together,
are different in MVS/370 and in MVS/XA.

      We must therefore decide how the old VTAM 2.2 should interact
with the new MVS/XA components.

      Our method of action may be summarized by the following
principle:  Any stand-alone "pure VTAM" load module will have the same
structure under XA as it had under 370.  This is because that piece
DOES NOT INTERACT with non-VTAM components which have changed.  On
the other hand, any part of VTAM which is linkedited together with
non-VTAM components THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED FROM MVS/370 TO XA, should
have its corresponding pieces from VTAM 2.2 FITTED INTO THE NEW
LINKEDIT PATTERN.  This is so that the rest of the operating system
components, exclusive of the VTAM part, may behave exactly as they had
behaved before the transplant.


HOW DID WE ACTUALLY DO IT?

      The key to our actions is in the SIDEBAR outline.  There are
fifteen general steps to the procedure.  These steps can be followed
as stated.  The rest of this article will merely supply "fill-in"
details and comments, as we feel they are needed for clarity.

      Step 1, ACCEPT processing on the old system, may have to be
done.  The transplanted VTAM component will be constructed from
elements in the distribution libraries, so these must be at
maintenance levels consistent with the level of the target libraries.
If necessary, we must run an ACCEPT job on the old system.  This will
make sure that the distribution libraries have their building blocks
at a level consistent with the level of the working target library
system.

      Step 2, creating pack backups and/or dataset backups, is always
sound policy when dealing with SMP-controlled systems.  One should
back up both the 370 and the XA SMP environments.  Probably, full pack
backups are the easiest to restore if needed.

      Steps 3 and 3A, SMP/E "UNLOAD" processing, put the SMP/E element
structure of the respective VTAM versions into transportable form.
The actual zone entries are reduced to UCLIN statements that can be
reloaded into another SMP/E zone later.  All this is accomplished by
the SMP/E UNLOAD process, as directed to the entries in each zone, for
the respective VTAM fmids.  Please note that since we are moving the
VTAM 2.2 entries, we do not really need the VTAM 3.2 entries.  But it
is best to have them for safety, since after VTAM 3.2 is deleted,
their source will be gone.

      Steps 4 and 5 need to be detailed more.  The output of the
SMP/E GENERATE in the case of VTAM consists of two parts:  a COPY
part and a LINKEDIT part.  Further, the LINKEDIT part is broken into
several JOBS, each of which updates ONE LIBRARY only, such as LINKLIB,
LPALIB, NUCLEUS, and VTAMLIB.  There's a small "gotcha" here.  In
order for the GENERATE job to produce proper DDNAMES for its output
jobstream, all DDNAMES have to have been defined to each zone by means
of DDDEFs.  Defining the DDNAMES in a hard-coded JCL "SMP procedure"
will not work.  GENERATE can only formulate DD statements out of the
DDDEF entries in the ZONE.  Fortunately, it is quick and easy to
construct a batch job that will accurately define necessary DDDEF
entries in each ZONE (via UCLIN).

      After the GENERATE jobs in Steps 4 and 5 have been run, two
sets of two decks should be available:  a COPY stream and a LINKEDIT
stream from the old VTAM (HVT2202), and a COPY stream and LINKEDIT
stream from the new VTAM (HVT3205 and JVT3215).  In step 11, which
is the crucial step, we shall produce a combined COPY deck merged from
BOTH COPY DECKS.  We shall also produce a combined LINKEDIT deck made
out of pieces of both LINKEDIT decks.

      Now look at Figure Four which shows the dummy FUNCTION DELVT32
that will delete both FMIDs for VTAM 3.2.  This FUNCTION, when APPLYed,
will delete all VTAM-based elements (modules) from the entire operating
system, wherever they reside in the TARGET libraries.  In the APPLY
utility report for DELVT32, LINKEDIT output showing REPLACE cards for
the VTAM modules in IEANUC01, SVCs 34, 93, and 94, and other mixed-FMID
load modules will appear.  Examination of equivalent VTAM 2.2 modules
will show that identical module names from the earlier VTAM release
could slip into all of the old VTAM module slots in the mixed-FMID load
modules.  (It helps to have this information for the crucial Step 11
later.)

      ACCEPT processing for DELVT32 will wipe the XA DLIBs completely
bare of all VTAM modules.  These VTAM modules will be the release 3.2
versions.  Keep this ACCEPT report around, but it is not needed
as much as the APPLY report for our purposes.

      I did Step 7 to guarantee that I'd copy ALL the necessary DLIB
members for VTAM 2.2 from the 370 system DLIBs to the XA DLIBs.  My
method for accomplishing this has its dangerous aspects, and there
is probably a better way.  I'd appreciate if a reader would inform
me of an better method of determining exactly the correct DLIB elements,
discovering possible ALIAS conditions, and accomplishing the physical
transfer exactly.  I'm about to submit a SHARE requirement to SMP/E
development so that SMP/E itself might be made to produce its own
"FORFMID library reports" in the future.

      Step 7 involves doing an APPLY CHECK of a dummy FUNCTION
DELVT22.  This FUNCTION is RECEIVEd in the 370 SMP GLOBAL ZONE.  It
aims to delete VTAM 2.2 (HVT2202) and is therefore dangerous.  It
must not be run for real.  Its purpose is to obtain a list of all
element names in HVT2202, together with the name of the DLIB that
each element resides in.

      This is of course, a fake delete.  A real delete of VTAM 2.2
would be disastrous.  Figure Six shows part of a copy job which I
derived from this report.  This job copies exactly the correct
elements from the 370 DLIBs to the XA DLIBs.  Remember though, that
SMP ELEMENT listings do not show any aliases, and the presence of
aliases must be determined by other methods.  I used the "PDS" product
to make sure that none of the DLIBs had alias members that belonged to
VTAM 2.2.  I did this by making a member list under ISPMODE consisting
of the VTAM 2.2 modules for each DLIB, and then entering option "5"
from the PDS(/E) memlist.  This picks up all aliases of members in the
group, if any.  In our case there were none.  Look also at Figure
Five.

      Step 9 actually deletes VTAM 3.2 from the XA system.  As I stated,
the most important report produced is the utility report from the APPLY
job, which has the linkedits of the load modules with "mixed FMID".

      Step 10 has to be done so the UNLOAD UCLIN from the 370 DLIB
and TARGET ZONES will slip smoothly into the XA DLIB and TARGET ZONES.
In the XA system, there is a SYSMOD entry for HVT2202 in both the
TARGET ZONE and the DLIB ZONE showing HVT2202 as having been deleted
by HVT3205.  These "bad" SYSMOD entries must be deleted with UCLIN, so
that the real SYSMOD entries for the actual FUNCTION HVT2202 can be
inserted later.

      Step 11 is the most crucial step.  The problem is to determine
how a VTAM 2.2 install would have fitted into the XA system.  The main
principle to follow is this:  VTAM 2.2 load modules which stand alone,
and are not mixed with modules from any other FMID, will go into the
new system as they went into the old one.  Therefore "pure" VTAM 2.2
JCLIN comes only from the 2.2 GENERATE output.  The "mixed FMID" JCLIN
has to look like the 3.2 GENERATE output, because that output will
reflect both the MVS/XA system load modules and the higher version of
TSO/E in the XA system.  Therefore, I spliced the two sets of decks
together cautiously and carefully according to this principle.  Again,
see Figures Six and Seven.  The pieces of linkedit GENERATE coming
from the NEW system should correspond exactly with the APPLY utility
report that deleted VTAM 3.2 from the NEW system.  The rest should
come from the OLD system.

      In Step 12 I physically copied the VTAM 2.2 elements from 370
DLIBs to the now stripped XA DLIBs.  In Step 13 I ran the actual hybrid
COPY and LINKEDIT decks to create the TARGET modules out of the DLIB
modules.  This created the physical modules for VTAM 2.2 within the XA
system, and the XA libraries would actually be usable in an IPL at
this stage.  But SMP in the XA system would not yet know about VTAM
2.2.

      Step 14 would now have to be carried out to load SMP with VTAM
2.2 information.  The UCLIN-format module information from the DLIB
ZONE UNLOAD from 370, is now UCLINed into the DLIB ZONE of the XA SMP
system.  Similarly, the UNLOAD deck from the old TARGET system is
UCLINed into the XA TARGET ZONE to inform it about all of its VTAM 2.2
elements.  Finally our composite hybrid GENERATE deck reflecting how
the VTAM 2.2 load modules will fit into XA, is JCLINed into the XA
TARGET ZONE.  The JCLIN processing will inform SMP about the linkedit
structure of all load modules involving VTAM-owned parts.  At this
point, SMP in the XA system now "knows" about VTAM 2.2 at its present
maintenance level.

      You must check carefully for errors at each step and fix them
as they occur.  I had to revise some of my original methods because
of errors that occurred while those things were being done.

      Well that's about it for now.  Ponder these items carefully.
They take a good deal of thought to understand properly.

      Good luck.  See you next month.

SIDEBAR.      Procedure steps to accomplish the replacement of VTAM 3.2
               on an MVS/XA system with VTAM 2.2 transplanted from our
               previous MVS/370 system.


      1.  Do ACCEPT processing on the 370 system for all HVT2202 PTFs
            that have been APPLYed.  This will load the DLIBs with the
            VTAM 2.2 elements at the highest "clean" levels.

      2.  Back up all disk packs involved.  (This goes without saying.)

      3.  UNLOAD from the old system:  the DLIB zone FORFMID(HVT2202)
            and the TARGET zone FORFMID(HVT2202).  See Figure One.

      3A. Optionally do the same FORFMID(HVT3205,JVT3125) off the
            new system, just to have the decks for reference.  In
            our case these decks will not be used.

      4.  Run GENERATE FORFMID(HVT2202) from the MVS/370 system.
            See Figure Two for an example.

      5.  Run GENERATE FORFMID(HVT3205,JVT3215) from the XA system.
            See Figure Three.

      6.  Create a dummy FUNCTION to run on the XA system, that will
            DELETE(HVT3205,JVT3215).  Call this FUNCTION DELVT32.
            This FUNCTION will actually be APPLYed and ACCEPTed.
            Figure Four will show an example.

      7.  Create a dummy FUNCTION to run on the 370 system, that will
            DELETE(HVT2202).  Call this FUNCTION DELVT22.  This
            FUNCTION will only be APPLY CHECKed.  DON'T APPLY IT--
            PLEASE!!  REJECT it as soon as you've finished with it,
            just to be safe.  The ELEMENT report from the APPLY
            CHECK listing for this FUNCTION will be used to create
            a COPY JOB to copy all DLIB elements from the old
            system's DLIBs to the new system's DLIBs.

      8.  Create the COPY JOB for the DLIB elements by either editing
            the APPLY CHECK report for DELVT22, or by using my COBOL
            program GIMELMNQ as a service aid.  GIMELMNQ is not publicly
            distributed yet.  Figure Five shows the output it produces.

      9.  APPLY and ACCEPT the delete FUNCTION DELVT32 on the new XA
            system.  SAVE THE REPORTS.  The utility report for the
            APPLY will contain crucial linkedits.

     10.  Use UCLIN to delete the SYSMOD entry for HVT2202 in both the
            TARGET and DLIB zones of the new system.  This entry had
            been marked as deleted by HVT3205, and it must be gotten
            rid of in both zones of the XA SMP/E system.

            DEL SYSMOD(HVT2202) .

            is the UCLIN statement required in both zones.

 *** 11.  Edit the GENERATE jobs for both VTAMs to produce one correct
            hybrid deck that we will actually use.  Details will follow
            on how to do this.  This step is the heart of the matter.
            See Figures Six and Seven.
          The GENERAL RULE:  Self-contained VTAM modules follow the
            old (2.2) pattern while modules interfacing with other
            components follow the new (3.2) pattern.

     12.  Copy all HVT2202 ELEMENTs (and their aliases, if any) from
            the "370" DLIBs to the XA DLIBs.  The XA DLIBs have now
            been stripped of VTAM elements by the ACCEPT of DELVT32.
            Figure Eight shows a part of my copy job created for this
            step.

     13.  Actually run the hybrid GENERATE copy job and linkedit jobs
            that you had created in Step 11.  This will load the
            TARGET libraries with the correct load modules.

     14.  Now bring SMP/E into sync.  UCLIN the DLIB UNLOAD of HVT2202
            into the DLIB ZONE of the XA system.  UCLIN the TARGET LIB
            UNLOAD of HVT2202 into the TARGET ZONE of the XA system.
            Then JCLIN the hybrid GENERATE deck into the XA system.
            Figures Nine and Ten illustrate these processes.

     15.  Check all jobs for clean return codes, and fix all errors,
            if any.  Move the modules to an IPL-able pack, and IPL.
            We should have a "runnable" installed product at this
            stage.  Voila.

FIGURE SEVEN.   Part of the "Hybrid LINKEDIT Job" constructed from
                the GENERATE of VTAM 2.2 combined with the GENERATE
                of VTAM 3.2.  Notice that "mixed FMID" linkedits
                were created from the VTAM 3.2 JCL, whereas all other
                linkedits were created from VTAM 2.2 JCL.  I was
                careful to check for the existence in release 2.2
                of all VTAM module names used in the "mixed FMID"
                linkedit JCL.
