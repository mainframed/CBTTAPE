A VTOC ADVENTURE - Part III

      I mentioned in a previous column that a colleague of mine had
accidentally deleted a partitioned dataset on a new MVS res pack, and
there was no reasonable backup.  Much SMP had been done to that
library since any previous backup had been made.  All that work would
have to be done over, and many other libraries would have been
involved unnecessarily.  Anyone who has had this experience knows,
that starting again from a backup and doing the SMP over is not so
easy.  Ah, if somehow, we could "undelete" that dataset....

      Well, folks, sometimes it can be done.  And I can proudly say
that at least once in my life, I did it.  Here's how.


A SUMMARY OF WHAT'S INVOLVED.

      Basically, to "undelete" a dataset on DASD, you have to re-create
its Format 1 VTOC entry, provided that the dataset has three extents or
fewer.  If there are more than three extents, you'd also have to
re-create a Format 3 VTOC entry, which gives the CCHHR's of the fourth
through sixteenth extents.

      Remember from our two past columns, that the Volume Table of
Contents or "VTOC" of a disk pack, is a dataset which is the pack's
directory of datasets.  "Physically" speaking, the VTOC is a keyed
BDAM unblocked dataset having fixed length records, which can also be
read sequentially.  The overall record length is 140, of which the
first 44 bytes constitute the key.  There are currently eight
different formats of VTOC records, picturesquely defined by IBM
as "Format 0" thru "Format 7".  Each VTOC record is alternatively
called a DSCB or Data Set Control Block.  Unlike most other control
blocks, which reside in computer memory, the DSCB resides on disk.
See Figure 1 for a summary of what each of the VTOC formats is for.

      Today we will concentrate on the Format 1 VTOC entry, which
describes the basic properties of a dataset on a disk pack.  My
specific problem involved the deletion of a dataset having only one
extent.  Therefore, we now have the job of constructing one Format 1
DSCB for it.  Figuring out what to do for this case, probably would be
enough work for today.  However, if you really wanted to get
experienced, you could probably un-delete a dataset with more extents.
After practicing, you could track down the other extents and even
rebuild a Format 3, if you really had to.  Actually, the extra extents
aren't that much harder.  Once the dataset's characteristics are
defined for the first extent, finding new extents is just a matter of
adding CCHHR disk locations, either to the Format 1 or to the Format 3.


OUR GAME PLAN.

      How do we approach this task?  Before doing anything else, we
have to find where the old data was on the disk.  Without doing that,
it is fruitless to try and make a directory entry, because the entry
has to have a place to point to.  Next, when we're sure where the old
data was, by CCHHR, it would be helpful to find another dataset which
is somewhat similar, and to look at its Format 1 DSCB as a model.
Especially the first time out, it helps to have a model to follow.
Later, as we've done this more times, the field names and locations in
the Format 1 DSCB will become more recognizable.  Then, we will be able
to fill them in more directly from specific knowledge of where they are
and what their values should be.  So with experience, we won't need
a model any more.

      Next, we have to un-index the disk pack if it was indexed, and
we have to locate a suitable Format 0 DSCB to start converting into a
Format 1.  After that, we'll start filling in the VTOC record fields
for a Format 1 DSCB, one at a time.  Once all the principal fields are
filled in, we'll then adjust the DS1LSTAR or "high water mark" field,
to correctly mark the true upper limit of the real data, within the
extents where the dataset was defined.  Finally, we have to fix the
un-indexed VTOC to correctly know that the deleted space is no longer
free.  Last, we re-index the VTOC if it had been indexed before.  If
the old dataset was cataloged, we'll have to recatalog the new one too.

      Since the space in this column is limited, I'll have to assume
a bit more knowledge from the reader than I usually do.  In this way,
we'll be able to shorten the explanations to fit into the space we
have available.


TOOLS.

      In order to do this work, we have to have tools.  First, we
need a program to produce a CCHHR dataset map of a disk pack, sorted
by tracks.  See Figure 2 for a picture of the type of output produced
by IEHMAP, or by the many "MAPDISK" programs that are available.
Then, we need a tool to find, display, and change individual VTOC
records.  If you want to stick strictly to IBM-supplied tools, you
can use a combination of IEHLIST and AMASPZAP, but I highly prefer a
public domain program called "Fullscreen ZAP" for this purpose.
Fullscreen ZAP is much quicker.  Finally, we'll need to check our
work.  ISPF 3.2 or the IBM TSO command called LISTD can be used to
check the dataset attributes in the VTOC entry that we've built.

      The non-IBM tools we talk about, may all be obtained from a
public domain software tape called the CBT MVS Utilities Tape, which
can be ordered from the NaSPA office for a handling charge.
Fullscreen ZAP is on File 134 of the CBT Tape, IEHMAP is on File 083,
the PDS command is on File 182, and the REVIEW TSO command is also on
File 134.  Readers of our previous columns have some prior knowledge
of all these tools.


DOING THE WORK.

      In my specific case, I was helped by the fact that I knew the
deleted dataset was 150 tracks in size, and that it was part of a new
MVS res pack.  Therefore, I ran IEHMAP against the pack, and looked
for a gap of 150 free tracks.  IEHMAP gave me a CCHHR range to look
at, and I then used Fullscreen ZAP in FULLVOL mode to examine the
deleted data.  In my case, there were two gaps of 150 tracks, but
Fullscreen ZAP showed that the data in the first gap was a PDS
directory with the properly named members.  See Figure 3.  Thus, I
was able to correctly figure out the CCHHR range where the deleted
dataset had been.

      We have to supply a bit more detail about this.  See Figure 2
to see the type of information that IEHMAP shows--specifically the
CCHHR range of the 150-track free space.  You clearly see the gap
starting at CCHHR 0277.0000, going up to CCHHR 0280.000E.  In order
to look at this data with Fullscreen ZAP, we have to run ZAP authorized
in FULLVOL mode.  The TSO command to do this is:  "ZAP 'FORMAT4.DSCB'
VOL(volser) FULLVOL".  This allows us to see all the data on the disk
pack, from the beginning to the end.  The initial command positions
us at Track 0, Record 1.  Then we enter the ABS subcommand, to see
data at an absolute CCHHR location on disk.  We enter: ABS0277000001
to look at the first record after the beginning of the extent.  This
shows a PDS directory with the names we expect.  See Figure 3.

      Now that we know the place where the data is, we have to go
about constructing the Format 1 VTOC record from a Format 0 record.
First, we un-index the disk pack if it was indexed.  This is done
with an ICKDSF job that includes among its control statements:
"BUILDIX DDNAME(ptstovol) OSVTOC".  Next, we have to find a Format 0
record to work with.  We do that by getting into Fullscreen ZAP with
the command:  TSO ZAP 'FORMAT4.DSCB' VOL(volser).  This will get us to
the Format 4 DSCB (the VTOC header).  We can step forward record by
record with repeated "R" commands until we find a record with all hex
zeros.  If that is too tedious, we can enter the subcommand LASTDS1
to find the last Format 1 DSCB in the VTOC, and then we can bop forward
a few records with "R" commands, until we find a Format 0 record at the
end.  Anyway, Fullscreen ZAP has its own internal help screens, which
you can enter with a "?" command and exit with a "U" command.

      Once we're at the Format 0 record that we want to work with,
it would help if we had a printout of a model Format 1 from another
pack.  In our case, since we have multiple res packs with other copies
of this dataset, we could enter Fullscreen ZAP on the other pack's
VTOC, and print screen or "DUMPF" the Format 1 DSCB for the
corresponding dataset on the other pack.  Then we could take that
printout and start constructing our own Format 1, replacing four or
eight bytes at a time on the former Format 0.

      Of course, our Format 1 will differ from the other dataset's
Format 1.  To get the dsect layout of a Format 1 DSCB, assemble the
macro IECSDSL1 from SYS1.MODGEN or AMODGEN, using the operand "1".
In other words, you would assemble the macro instruction:  "IECSDSL1 1".
Then you will have a road map of the Format 1 DSCB, to see where you
are.

      Fields that are likely to differ are:  the Dataset Name (perhaps),
the Create Date, the Date Last Referenced, the DS1LSTAR (high water
mark), the Extent Lower Limit, the Extent Upper Limit, and perhaps
other extent information.  The rest of the Format 1 will probably be
similar.  When you have filled in the entire Format 1 DSCB, remember
to test the supposed attributes of the dataset by using ISPF 3.2 or
ISPF 3.4.  You might have to play around a little.

      To set DS1LSTAR, use the TSO REVIEW command on the pds (with the
VOL keyword, since the dataset is still uncataloged), and sort the
directory by TTR.  This will give a good indicator of where you should
start setting DS1LSTAR, by going a bit past the highest TTR in the
directory.  Make sure you recover all of the data in the last member.

      After you've finished, you should have something that looks like
Figure 4.  Use ISPF 3.2 over and over again until you know that the
dataset is good, and all the old members are available for use.  You
must now reclaim the free space.  Using Fullscreen ZAP, go to the
Format 4 DSCB (enter "P" to go to the beginning of the VTOC).  Then
turn on the DIRF bit (X'04' at +E past +2C from the beginning of the
record).  Then go into ISPF 3.2 and try to allocate a new dataset on
the pack.  The console will show a message that the VTOC Convert
routine has been entered for reason, DIRF.  This will fix up the free
space for the pack.  If the pack has to be indexed, run ICKDSF with
statement:  "BUILDIX DDNAME(ptstovol) IXVTOC".  The dataset should now
be usable.

      If you're a born system programmer, this should be the utmost
fun, when you see that you've gotten the dataset back.  In any case,
you've at least helped your shop, and you've learned quite a bit in
the process.  Good luck.  See you next month.

       FORMAT 0 DSCB  -  Blank entry (all hex zeros)
       FORMAT 1 DSCB  -  Dataset descriptor
       FORMAT 2 DSCB  -  ISAM dataset information
       FORMAT 3 DSCB  -  Location of extra extents
       FORMAT 4 DSCB  -  VTOC Header Record
       FORMAT 5 DSCB  -  Chained Free Space Descriptors
                           (if VTOC index is disabled or is not there)
       FORMAT 6 DSCB  -  Cylinder sharing
       FORMAT 7 DSCB  -  Free Space Descriptors for 3390 model 9
                           (or future large-capacity disk packs)

  Every VTOC begins with a Format 4 DSCB.  It is always followed
  by one Format 5 DSCB.  This Format 5 DSCB will begin a chain of
  other Format 5's to describe the free space on the volume if
  there is no VTOC Index, or if the VTOC Index is disabled.
