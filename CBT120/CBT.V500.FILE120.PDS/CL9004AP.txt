      This month, I'd like to begin a mini-series to feature a
deserving product that is found on the CBT Mods Tape.  Anyone who
has extensively used this product will immediately understand why
we should devote some major attention to it.  I'm definitely not
repeating myself in talking about this product more than I have
already.  Using this package will earn you some enormous savings
of time and effort!

      I have been asked (even by my boss) how it is possible for me
to do all of my company work, and still have time to write articles
and do many "side projects" in the systems programming field.  My
reply is invariably that I use many tools to shorten the work.  The
time invested in installing and learning the tools, is quickly made
back from the shortcuts made possible by using them.  My second
reply, is that "I use PDS".

      I have written quite a lot about "PDS" (the PDS Program
Product).  Those of you who are immersed with using PDS, will readily
agree that I have not come near to saying enough about its enormous
power to help a systems programmer.  To answer the skeptics, let me
just tell you how my own involvement with this marvelous product
grew.

      A good friend was kind enough to give me my first CBT
tape "n" years ago.  After looking at a printout of File 1 (the
documentation), which describes its enormous number and variety of
free offerings, I felt like a kid in a toy store who could take
home any toy he wanted for nothing.  For close to half a year, I
collected and tried tools by the dozens, expanding my powers and
enjoying every minute of it.  I remember installing eight programs
one day, six the next, another four or five afterward, and so on
for a good while.

      Then my friend took me aside.  He told me to look inward
instead of outward.  "Look inside PDS alone for a while.  You'll
see almost all of what you need in there, usually done even better
than with the 'individual' tools."  Having been awakened to notice
the PDS product, I surprised even myself by being absorbed for the
next half year in exploring the tools that were embedded in it
alone.

      This is a true story.  Hear me out, and see some of the things
that PDS can do, easily and with small effort, for you.

GETTING THE TOOL (if you don't already have it).

      First you have to GET PDS.  It is found (version 8.3) on File
182 of a recent CBT tape, with necessary auxiliary programs on Files
296 and 112 of that tape.  The install is the assembly-link of a load
module, and the copying of ISPF panels and a message member into the
appropriate libraries for your ISPF session to use.  Assembly and
linkedit of the auxiliary load modules from files 296 and 112
completes the installation.  Options for tailoring the main load
module can be adjusted using conditional assembly globals that are
located in members #PDSGEN and #PDSGENB of file 182.  That's it.

      PDS is executed as a TSO command, or as a dialog manager
option under ISPF.  If ISPF is present in the TSO session, the two
modes may be toggled back and forth.  PDS may also be executed
recursively under ISPF if a command table entry is set up to invoke
it (see my May 1989 column).

      PDS comes with loads of documentation and a TSO help member
for all its subcommands.  PDS is free for all to use.

      For your extra information, a vendor-supported outgrowth of PDS
with additional capability (called PDS/E) has been released by Serena
Consulting of Burlingame, California and is being supported by the
principal authors of the free PDS product.  PDS/E, although currently
a released product, is being intensively enhanced further by its
developers, and I can assure you that its maintenance agreement will
be well worth the money.

      However, the public product's great capabilities even without
the vendor enhancements are extremely beneficial to its users, and
so, we will concentrate on the public PDS product in this column.
People in installations that "do not like public software" may
inquire from Serena about PDS/E.  Also, you may want some of the
extra capability of PDS/E later on, once you have a good idea of what
the "free" PDS can do.  But "public PDS" offers enough to swamp a
user's curiosities for a good while, as it did to my own.

ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT, WHAT CAN YOU DO ?

      What are some sticky everyday system programming situations
that can be easily solved with PDS?  We will consider one particular
problem for this month's instalment.

      The problem is:  How can you keep track of vendor load modules
in a big program product library, where lots of modules from many
different packages have been mixed together?  There is a familiar
difficulty that occurs when you have reinstalled later releases of
some of the products.  How do you make sure all of the modules in
the library are from the new release and that you've deleted the
modules from the older releases?  How can you ensure the "purity" of
each product whose modules are in that library?

      This is really not a hard problem to solve, when PDS is
available.  (It is as close as the nearest NEW CBT tape.)  One
need only implement a few product installation standards made
practical by certain of the PDS capabilities.

      The solution boils down to MARKING the load modules, to show
them as belonging to a certain product and a certain release at
install time.  Then, to isolate all the modules from one product,
once they've been mixed together with the others, you merely have to
pick these modules out by use of the "markings" you've given them.

      The modules from an older release of one product will then
be shown as belonging to that product, but to a previous release of
it.  Modules from a completely different product will have completely
different markings, so they will be readily distinguishable from all
modules belonging to the other products.

      How does PDS make it possible to implement this scheme?  PDS
has the capability of SUPPLYING SUCH MARKINGS.  It can also POSITIVELY
SELECT ONLY THOSE MODULES having certain given markings or partial
markings.  Thus, it can choose with complete certainty, all modules
belonging to a given product, or to a known release of that given
product, provided that the modules have been marked.  It will exclude
all other modules in the library from the selection.  In this way, we
have achieved positive recognition of all modules belonging to a
given product and a given version of that product.

HOW DO YOU USE PDS TO MARK LOAD MODULES ?

      So what are the markings?  And how does PDS supply them and
use them for group selection?

      For a load module, the user-supplied "marking" is the "SSI" or
"System Status Indicator".  The SSI is a four-byte hex number (eight
hex digits) that can be placed in a module's load library directory
entry by the linkage editor.  During linkedit, the SSI is supplied
using the control statement, SETSSI, followed by the eight hexadecimal
digits which will constitute that module's SSI.

      PDS can change any module's SSI "on the fly" without another
linkedit, or it can supply a new SSI where none existed before.  PDS
can not only do this for one load module at a time, but it can do it
for any preselected group of modules in a library or for all members
of the library, all at once.

      PDS can also look at any load library and select only those
modules having a given SSI, partial SSI, or consecutive string pattern
in an SSI to be in its current member subgroup.  Membership in PDS's
current member subgroup means that subsequent PDS operations can be
performed on ALL MEMBERS IN THE ENTIRE SUBGROUP AT ONCE.  PDS can
then delete or copy out to another library, all the modules belonging
to one subgroup of members.  We see that we can isolate and/or operate
on one product's modules from within a large library through using
PDS.

      Which PDS commands can change a module's SSI, and what commands
will select all modules in a library having a certain given SSI?

      To supply an SSI to a load module, or to change an existing
SSI, we use the ATTRIB subcommand of PDS.  If we wish to mark all
modules in an install library with the same SSI, the commands would
be:

       PDS  install.library.name
                       Assuming PDS is the PDS load module's name,
                       this command points PDS to the desired library.

       ATTRIB  :  SSI(hhhhhhhh)
                       where the colon in the member name field
                       signifies "all members" and hhhhhhhh is
                       the eight-digit SSI hex number that we
                       want to assign to all the modules.

      If we've already selected a subset of members to be included in
PDS's "current member subgroup", we can supply the SSI to all of
these members at once, by substituting an asterisk "*" for the colon.
An asterisk in the member name field of a PDS subcommand always
denotes "all members belonging to the currently selected member
subgroup".

      At install time for a product, we can easily supply a telltale
SSI to all its modules by using the ATTRIB subcommand of PDS.  Then
when we copy the modules into the program product library for public
use, they will already have been distinctly and properly marked.

      How can we use PDS to select a member subgroup consisting of
only those modules having a certain given SSI?  We can do so, using
the "IF" subcommand of PDS.  The actual command would be:

       IF  :  SSI(hhhhhhhh) THEN(SUBLIST)

"SUBLIST" is a PDS command that creates the "current member subgroup"
as a list of member names.  Thus, the result of the subcommand is,
that the new "current member subgroup" defined by PDS, now consists
of a list of only of those members having the SSI equal to "hhhhhhhh".
The currently selected subgroup can now be referred to by putting the
asterisk "*" in place of the member name field in any PDS subcommand
executed subsequently.

      Thus,

       COPY  *  'ANOTHER.LIBRARY'

will copy all of the selected members over to 'ANOTHER.LIBRARY'.

       DELETE  *

will delete all the members of the subgroup from the current library.
And so forth using other PDS commands.

      In our installation, we use the following SSI naming convention
to mark vendor load modules.  The first four hex digits will denote
the product identifier (made to be consistent by arbitrary
convention).  The last four digits will be a designation of the
release and modification levels.  Therefore modules from CA-11
Release 1.4 newsletter 2 will be marked with an SSI of CA111402.  To
pick out ALL CA-11 modules in a given library, we need only ask for:

       IF  :  SSI(CA11) THEN(SUBLIST)

and we will get ALL modules of ALL releases of CA-11 that we have
previously marked and installed.  This is because any SSI that we
assign to a CA-11 load module always begins with the four hex digits:
CA11.  To obtain CA-11 modules belonging only to release 1.4, we will
instruct PDS as follows:

       IF  :  SSI(CA1114) THEN(SUBLIST)

This command will pick all of the CA-11 release 1.4 modules, regardless
of "newsletter" modification level.  Finally, to pick the CA-11
release 1.4 modules that have been upgraded by the Newsletter 2
modification level, we merely ask PDS:

       IF  :  SSI(CA111402) THEN(SUBLIST)

and all modules affected by the Newsletter 2 upgrades, will be selected
for membership in the current member subgroup.  This whole scheme is
neat and simple.

Enter SYS1.VENDOR for Forensics.

      In addition to marking all of our program product modules to
be selectable by partial SSI, we maintain another card-image type
library that we call SYS1.VENDOR.  In SYS1.VENDOR, we keep some
"fingerprints" of each module that was installed with a new release
of a product.  These "fingerprints" are generated by some other
facilities in PDS, and they can readily be compared with similar
fingerprints generated from the currently running modules that are in
the system.  Having the fingerprints available from install time will
often enable us to determine if a module has been changed since then.

      What kind of fingerprints do we take?  Actually, PDS gives us
a considerable choice.  Our own choice was affected by the
consideration that we did not want the records to be too bulky.  In
practice, we take four or five pictures of the modules in our shop.
We take a short ATTRIB listing, a long MEMLIST listing, a MEMBERS
listing, and a linkedit HISTORY listing.  If there are not too many
modules, we may also keep CSECT MAPS of them, obtainable with the PDS
"MAP" command.

      With these listings on record, it is possible in most cases to
positively identify the particular level of any vendor-supported load
module that we have in one of our production libraries.

      I have supplied illustrations (Figures 1 thru 6) to show the
kinds of "module fingerprints" that we keep.  Seeing these should be
most instructive in illustrating the power of our techniques.  Please
bear in mind that corresponding records can always be obtained by PDS
from existing load libraries, so that we can graphically compare our
archived snapshots with current ones obtained from modules we are now
using.

      In conclusion, we have shown how a very small subset of PDS
capabilities will support an important function that every
data processing shop has to cope with--making sure that you're
executing the correct version of your programs.  Application groups
can benefit from these techniques also, and can just as easily use
them as we systems programmers can.

      I hope that next time, I can present another, equally useful
shop technique that exploits the powerful PDS utility functions.
If you (our readership) keep your enthusiasm, we can keep doing this
from time to time, and add to the mini-series every couple of months.

      I have considered the idea (energy permitting) of producing
a periodical PDS(/E) Newsletter containing techniques such as this.
Given the versatility of PDS and PDS/E, such a newsletter can go on
for years and years and years.  Anyone who has ideas or suggestions
about such a project and its benefits may call me directly or write
to me about it.

WHO YOU GONNA CALL ?
