WRITING YOUR OWN TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR - Part 1

      Sometimes we surprise ourselves.  Lately, I've done it a lot.
I'm finding that I know how to code in assembler language, far better
than I thought I could.  When I was first starting out in this business,
I used to look at many amazing programs that other people wrote,
especially those of my teacher, Jeff Broido.  I wondered whether I would
ever produce similar pieces of work, later on in my own career.

      Even when I broke in (many years ago), MVS Systems Programming
no longer required the writing of customized assembler code all day.
It was already a job that largely consisted of installing and tweaking
the operating system, to make sure everything was working properly.
Sure, I went to assembler school and managed to code a few exits here
and there.  But writing major utilities that were hitherto
unavailable, was no longer part of the job description.  So I didn't
get extensive assembler coding practice on a regular basis.  If it
weren't for my involvement in handling free code from the CBT MVS Tape,
and looking at a lot of source code examples from there, I feel that
I'd never achieve the satisfaction of building my assembler skills to
the point where I myself could do something major.

      Today, we're going to talk about how to create an assembler
program which does a useful task under TSO.  Nowadays, we have REXX
available, and most of us try to create our handy little personal tools
in REXX.  But despite the large capabilities of the REXX language under
TSO, I feel it is still a worthwhile skill to write assembler programs
too.  Assembler programs can execute faster.  And assembler programs
have full access to all facilities of the operating system.  When you
code in assembler, you are not subject to any artificial restrictions
as to what your programs can do.

      When I first started, I thought that writing a "TSO Program",
or more exactly, a "TSO Command Processor", was something that was
quite difficult.  IBM's manual on the subject, which was called,
"Writing a TSO Command Processor or TMP" (Terminal Monitor Program),
looked very difficult to get through.  Actually, I found later, that I
could write many working programs, without having deep knowledge.
Knowing a few fundamental principles was enough.  Today, I want to
help you "cut through the ice", so you too, can start doing this stuff
yourself.  IBM's current manual on this subject, called TSO/E
Programming Guide, is much easier to read than the old IBM manual was.


How is a TSO Command Processor Different?

      A TSO Command Processor, or (in other words) a program that is
designed to be executed during a TSO session, is not much different
from any program that's designed to run in batch.  When you enter the
program, you have to save the registers using the normal conventions,
and when you leave the program, you have to restore the registers in
the usual way.  Register 15 comes into the program, pointing to the
entry point, and Register 14 contains the return address of the caller.
The main difference is Register 1, which points to a TSO control block
called the CPPL, or Command Processor Parameter List.  We'll talk about
the CPPL in the next section.

      But first, let's backtrack a bit.  Let's ask ourselves the
question:  What exactly is a TSO command?  The answer is that a TSO
command is a load module.  When you type a TSO command on the screen
during a TSO session, you're actually executing a load module, which
has that command name.  For example, if you execute a TSO SEND command,
to send a message to another TSO user or to the console operator,
you're actually executing a load module whose name is "SEND".  The way
IBM ships this command, SEND is a load module in SYS1.CMDLIB, a library
that is filled with many essential TSO commands, such as DELETE,
ALLOCATE, ACCOUNT, DEFINE, CALL, and so forth.  Each of those commands
is a separate load module in SYS1.CMDLIB.  Your TSO session has access
to these commands because SYS1.CMDLIB is in the system link list, and
all programs executing under MVS, have access to programs in the system
link list.

      Now suppose you had access to another program whose load module
name was SEND, and you copied or linkedited its load module into
another load library that was pointed to as a STEPLIB in your TSO Logon
Proc.  Since the STEPLIB library is accessed in your TSO session before
the link list libraries are accessed, when you type a SEND command in
TSO, you'll execute your own personal SEND program, and not IBM's SEND
program.  If you wanted access to IBM's SEND program again, you'd have
to either rename your own load module to another name, like SENDX, or
you'd have to delete it from your STEPLIB library.  The rename route is
probably the more useful one to take, because if you want your own
program instead of IBM's, you can still issue the SENDX command under
your TSO session, whereas if you deleted your own version, you could no
longer execute it at all.

      There's one last topic we have to cover, before we can go back
to talking about actually writing the program.  That's the question of
APF authorization.  MVS provides a "safety net" for most programs, so
they don't change essential system control blocks in such a way that
they'd damage the system.  However, if a program, or in our case a TSO
command, has to perform a system internals function that's normally
protected, we can "authorize" it to do so.

      The program authorization facility in MVS is called "APF
Authorization" (for Authorized Program Facility).  IBM's SEND command
is an example of an authorized program.  Why does SEND need to be
authorized?  Many installations allow the average TSO user only READ
access to SYS1.BRODCAST, a dataset which contains TSO user messages and
system notifications to TSO users.  You certainly wouldn't want to give
an average user RACF UPDATE access to SYS1.BRODCAST.  By mistake, the
user could then overwrite SYS1.BRODCAST with IEBGENER, or do some other
stupid thing, and we want to protect against that.  But we also want
all TSO users to be able to send messages to other TSO users, even if
the other users aren't logged on.  These messages would go to the
SYS1.BRODCAST dataset, normally (if TSO Userlogs aren't invoked).
Therefore, every TSO user has to be able to update the SYS1.BRODCAST
dataset in this special way, by using the SEND command.

      So the problem gets solved by "authorizing" the SEND command
using the APF facility, and when the SEND command is authorized, it
can circumvent the normal TSO user's "read only" restriction to
SYS1.BRODCAST.  The newly empowered SEND command, can then do the
writing of the message to SYS1.BRODCAST, on behalf of the normally
unempowered TSO user.

      To authorize the SEND command, or any other TSO command, we have
to mark its load module (in the pds directory of the load library) as
APF authorized, and the library itself has to be made known to the
system, through the APF authorization table, as an APF authorized
library.  In former releases of MVS, all link list libraries would
always be APF authorized by default, but now, through the IEASYSnn
parameter, LNKAUTH, this doesn't have to be the case.  The system
authorization table is defined (in modern MVS systems) by the PROGnn
member of PARMLIB.  There's one more catch though.  In the IKJTSOnn
PARMLIB member, a TSO command has to be listed among the programs in
the AUTHCMD program list.  Otherwise TSO (and not the MVS system itself)
will block the APF authorization of the program execution.  So to
authorize a TSO command, we need all three conditions to be fulfilled:
its load module has to be marked APF authorized through the SETCODE
AC(1) linkedit statement, it has to reside in an APF authorized load
library, and it has to be listed in the AUTHCMD list of the IKJTSOnn
member of PARMLIB.

      I'd like to relate a personal technique I've discovered, for
obtaining what I call "personal APF authorization".  The AUTHCMD and
AUTHPGM program lists, used to be made known to TSO in two csects,
called IKJEFTE2 and IKJEFTE8 respectively.  Once upon a time, those
csects were part of the terminal monitor program IKJEFT02, but now
they still exist, in a separate small load module called IKJTABLS.  You
can find the default IKJTABLS in SYS1.LPALIB, and it doesn't have much
in it.  My trick is that if you put your own (greatly expanded) version
of IKJTABLS in an authorized STEPLIB library in your personal TSO Logon
Proc, it will completely override all the settings in the active
IKJTSOnn member of PARMLIB.  This trick is intended for experienced
systems programmers only, but it's very useful when you're working on a
large system, where you can't disturb the global PARMLIB settings that
everybody else uses.


WRITING YOUR OWN TSO PROGRAM

      Now that we've gone through these preliminaries, we'll talk
about how to use the CPPL, how to use IBM's TSO facilities, and how to
write handy TSO utilities that will enhance your working life for years
to come.  We'll have to continue this topic next month too, because
there's a lot to say.

      Take a look at Figure 1, which is the IKJCPPL macro that maps
the Command Processor Parameter List, that is passed to your program
via Register 1.  The CPPL contains four address pointers, and when
your program gains control, the first thing you should do, is to copy
these address pointers into program storage so you can refer to them
later.  At this point, we're most concerned with the contents of the
command buffer.  But the other pointers, to the UPT, the PSCB, and
the ECT, will come into play later, when we might need to examine the
contents of these 3 important control blocks.

      As its name implies, the Command Buffer contains everything
you entered into a TSO command when you invoked its command processor
program under TSO.  In addition, the Command Buffer starts with a
4-byte header that is divided into 2 halfwords.  The first halfword
contains the binary numeric length of the entire command buffer,
including the header.  The second halfword contains a numeric value
known as the "offset".  This offset field conveniently points you to
the beginning of any command operands.  Or it contains the number of
characters in the command itself, if there aren't any extra operands.
I'll explain.

      Suppose I entered a TSO command:  RENAME DATASET.A DATASET.B .
This command (RENAME), with its operands (the dataset names), contains
26 characters in all.  If I entered more than one space between the
operands, the command would be longer.  Now if I entered this command
at the beginning of a line on my TSO terminal, the command buffer
would then be 30 bytes long--4 bytes for the header, and 26 bytes for
the command with all its text that follows.  In this scenario, the
offset would contain the number 7, which is the number of text bytes
before the first operand:  DATASET.A .  So to point to DATASET.A ,
so I can parse it, I'd do the following:  Please refer to Figure 2
for details.

      I'm assuming I've saved the pointer containing the address of
the command buffer, that was in Register 1.  I'll do a Load Register
instruction, LR  R11,R1 , to move the address of the command buffer
from the (changeable) Register 1 to the less-used Register 11.

      First, I point to the address of the command buffer, which is at
an offset of 0 bytes past Register 1.  I pick up the number of bytes in
the command buffer by a Load Halfword instruction:  LH  R3,0(,R1) , to
place the total number of bytes in the command buffer in a register--in
this case, Register 3.  Then I do a Store Halfword instruction to save
this value in my program.  That is:  STH R3,CMBLENG , where CMBLENG is
a 2-byte field in my program.  In our case, CMBLENG will now contain
the binary value of 30, or hex 001E.  Before changing the value of
Register 3, it's advisable at this point, to check to see that its
value is greater than 4, just to make sure that a command was entered.
We issue a Compare Halfword instruction:  CH  R3,=H'4' , and a BNH
(Branch Not High) instruction afterwards, to point to an error-handling
routine, or to get out of the program with a warning message.  To pick
up the value of the offset, which is a halfword, two bytes past
Register 1, we issue a LH  R3,2(,R1) , and then issue STH  R3,OFFSETT ,
where OFFSETT is another 2-byte field in our program.  In our case,
OFFSETT will now contain the hex value 0007.

      Now, we can utilize the condition code capabilities of the
Subtract instructions, to determine if we have any operands or not,
and if we have them, we can take the appropriate action.

      Load the length of the command buffer into work Register 5,
using LH  R5,CMBLENG .  Load the offset into Register 3 if it isn't
already there:  LH  R3,OFFSETT .  Issue the Subtract Register
instruction:  SR  R5,R3 , to subtract the offset value from the total
length of the command buffer.  Since the command buffer has a 4-byte
header, we can now issue a Subtract Halfword instruction:
SH  R5,=H'4' , to subtract 4 more bytes from the offset difference,
to account for the length of the header record.  If the resulting
value is zero, there were no operands entered after the command.
If the resulting value is less than zero, there's an error condition,
and if the resulting value is greater than zero, we've got operands
to parse.  We can check all of this, using the return codes from the
Subtract Halfword instruction.

      By looking up the Subtract instructions in the Principles of
Operation Manual, we see that a zero result gives a condition code of
8 (byte 0 is one).  A negative result gives a condition code of 4
(byte 1 is one), and an overflow result gives a condition code of 1
(byte 3 is one).  Thus, to test for these conditions, we issue the
Branch on Condition (BC) instruction as follows.  First to test for
the zero result (no command operands), we issue:  BC  8,ERRMSG1 ,
to issue a message that the command should be entered with operands.
Then, we test for the negative or overflow conditions with the
instruction:  BC  5,GETOUT1 , to handle that case, and get out of the
program.

      Now, we're ready to parse our operands.  Register 11 contains
the address of the command buffer, that was copied from Register 1
originally.  So we point to the contents of the command buffer in
Register 1 as follows:  LA  R1,0(,R11) ,  add the offset value to it:
AR  R1,R3 , (possibly after LH  R3,OFFSETT), bump the value up by 4, to
compensate for the Command Buffer header:  LA  R1,4(,R1) , and now R1
is pointing to the location in storage where the operands begin.

      We now have a choice.  We can either examine our command's
operands ourselves, by writing our own instructions, or we can use
IBM's official TSO command parsing interface called IKJPARS.  I don't
have the space to continue the discussion past this point now, so
we'll pick it up here, next month.  See Figure 2 for the instructions
we've executed so far.

      If you're fairly new to assembler, I hope you've gotten a
realization that "I can really do this".  You really can.  It's quite
easy, once you've gotten the hang of it.  The CBT MVS Utilities Tape,
which you can access online over the Internet, has very many coding
examples of TSO commands, which you can learn from.  I'd especially
recommend File 300 of the CBT Tape, which you can access directly
at  ftp://ftp.cbttape.org/pub/cbttape/cbt/CBT300.zip  (case sensitive).
To see the CBT Tape offerings in general, go to www.naspa.net , and
click on "Download CBT".  You'll have a lot to look at.

      Good luck.  I'm looking forward to seeing you next month.
