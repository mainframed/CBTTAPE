EDIT AND SYSTEM RECOVERY.

      My systems programming teacher Jeff Broido used to emphasize a
few principles.  A very important one was to invest a little bit of
time every day to learn new tools.  Jeff used to say that the time
spent playing with the new stuff, will definitely be saved later.  You
will get paid back.  In my years of experience, I've found this to be
very true.  Most of us have a tendency to succumb to inertia at work.
After a period of initial growth, we get to a point where we feel that
if we got by yesterday, we can get by the same way today.  Jeff's
first principle, if followed as a habit, will help overcome this
inertia and force us to have a more sustained professional growth.

      A second principle I learned from him, was always to have more
than one way to do any job.  In fact, the more ways you have, the
better.  On the systems level, anything can break, and one needs to
have a way to recover from or circumvent such an occurrence.

      My favorite war story about this second principle concerns
ICKDSF, the IBM utility which is used to initialize a disk pack.  One
might imagine that IBM would never allow an essential utility like
ICKDSF to break.  There are perhaps a few people in administrative
positions who have a tendency to think like that.  I once found a way
to "clip" a disk pack (i.e. change its volume serial name) without
using ICKDSF.  I used the public domain Fullscreen ZAP program with
its FULLVOL keyword to do the rename directly to the disk id record
(track 0 record 3).  A few months later, at a very critical time for
us, ICKDSF did break, while MVS was running under VM.  There was
nothing IBM could do for us on short notice.  ICKDSF under that
circumstance was completely unusable.  My little technique saved our
whole project, without causing any noticeable impact to the users.  It
was like having a second key to your car, after you'd locked the first
one inside.

      Today's topic will lean heavily on these two principles.  Our
current subject is about how to edit crucial datasets under emergency
conditions, helping you to recover your system.  This will prove to be
very useful knowledge in itself.  However, the mental approach which
gave rise to this knowledge, comes directly from Jeff Broido's teaching:
Invest some time every day to learn new tools.  And always look for more
than one way to do any job.  These general principles have wider
application than our specific "tips and tricks for the day".  In the
long run, it could be that you'll have even greater benefit from this
mental approach than from the knowledge itself.  With that said, let's
talk about emergency editing and system recovery.


EMERGENCY EDITING.  WHY?

      Nowadays, I'd bet that most of us would think of the ISPF Editor
when we think of editing a file.  It wasn't always so, as old-timers
will testify.  Once upon a time, all that was available under OS was
the line editor, called EDIT.  Amazingly, EDIT is still around, and it
is still effectively supported by IBM.  From the MVT days, I remember
that we had an editing product which allowed us to type over anything
on a full screen.  It was called FSE or Full Screen Edit.  The version
we had then was a vendor product, but there is a similar version of FSE
which runs on MVS and is free.  This version of FSE can be found on
File 207 of the CBT MVS Utilities Tape, an independently produced tape
that can be ordered through the NaSPA office.  From now on in this
column, when we talk about FSE, we'll mean the free MVS version from
the CBT Tape.

      Following Jeff Broido's second principle, it pays to set up and
learn to use FSE for emergency purposes.  FSE consists of only eight
small load modules, which you can assemble from source code.  I'm sure
that most shops can find a linklist library where these can be easily
stowed away, to be ready if needed in an emergency.

      A logical question is:  "Why should we need to go to this
trouble?"  Our practical answer:  Sometimes ISPF, and the ISPF editor,
can't be run.  We could then certainly use a substitute file editor.

      Let's explain.  ISPF needs a whole bunch of datasets allocated
to your TSO session in order to run.  DDNAMES required are:  ISPLLIB
for ISPF load libraries, ISPPLIB for panel libraries, ISPMLIB for
message libraries, ISPSLIB for skeleton libraries, ISPTLIB for table
libraries, ISPPROF for the ISPF profile dataset, SYSPROC for CLISTs and
REXX execs, and possibly others.  For most of these DDNAMES, if the
concatenation of datasets belonging to that DDNAME cannot be allocated,
ISPF won't work at all.  The ISPF editor will therefore be unusable.

      Most of the time, these DDNAMES get allocated to your TSO
session either through JCL in your logon procedure, or with dynamic
allocation under your logon CLIST or REXX exec.  If one dataset is
missing somewhere, and a DDNAME isn't allocated because of it, what
happens depends on the allocation method used.  If the allocation
is in the JCL for the logon proc, the entire TSO session is dead.  If
the allocation was done dynamically through the logon CLIST or REXX
after the TSO session was started, only ISPF is dead.  Either way,
you still don't have the use of the ISPF editor.

      Clearly, one can see from here, that your session is safer if
most of the datasets are allocated through a CLIST or REXX and not in
the logon proc JCL.  If you leave most of the allocations out of the
JCL, doing them later through a CLIST or REXX exec, at least you'll
still have a TSO session to work with, after any of these allocations
fail.  When the allocations from the logon proc fail, you don't even
get in.  Your TSO session goes down with a JCL error, the same as a
batch job with a JCL error would.  It's far better to have a less
powerful TSO session, than to have no session at all to work with.

      Once you've taken the measures to start your TSO sessions using
a "bare bones" logon procedure with later CLIST or REXX dataset
allocations, we can talk about exploiting FSE.  FSE will edit a
dataset or a pds member with almost nothing being actually allocated
to your TSO session.  FSE is SMALL and consists of a few load modules
only.  FSE doesn't need the numerous dataset allocations that ISPF
needs.  Therefore you'll be able to fix PARMLIB members, PROCs in
SYS1.PROCLIB and other crucial system elements if you get a minimal
TSO session going, having FSE available from a linklist library.

      Everything we're saying about using FSE for emergency file
editing also applies to using the IBM TSO line editor called EDIT.
EDIT is a TSO command found in SYS1.CMDLIB, which is usually in the
link list.  Therefore, EDIT requires no additional dataset allocations.
Also, EDIT is available on almost every MVS system, and normally needs
no additional setting up.  EDIT is just a bit tricky to use, and
requires some prior practice (maybe about an hour or two) in order
for the user to feel comfortable with it.

      So one might ask the question:  Why do most of us feel helpless
when ISPF isn't there?  The answer is simply that we have not invested
some time in preparing ourselves to use these other editing tools.


GETTING STARTED WITH FSE.

      FSE consists of eight load modules which can be assembled from
source code and link-edited to one of your linklist libraries.  To
invoke FSE from your TSO session, one need only enter the command:
FSE 'dataset.name'  plus perhaps an optional keyword.  Full editing
of a dataset or pds member can only be done if the dataset or member
has sequence numbers, although browsing (invoked by the LIST option)
can be done without any sequence numbers in the data.  During an
emergency, this limitation is usually minor.  You're usually happy to
be able to fix the SYS1.PARMLIB or SYS1.PROCLIB member that is wrong.
However, the TSO EDIT command, which is somewhat less convenient to
use than FSE, does not require sequence numbers in the data, although
sequence numbers make the editing much easier.  We will talk about the
EDIT command soon.

      FSE is relatively simple to use, and its HELP member, which is
partly shown in Figure 2, is quite short.  You can effectively exploit
FSE with about 15 minutes of practice.  Although FSE is not crammed with
sophisticated features, it gets the job done in a pinch, and is very
easy to use and to learn.  With FSE, you'll be fixing broken data in
minutes.


THE TSO EDIT COMMAND.

      Once, (not so) many years ago, the TSO EDIT command was the only
available effective way for manipulating JCL, program source code, and
CLISTs under TSO.  Jeff Broido, in a recent conversation, told me that
when the SPF editor (the precursor to the ISPF editor) first came out,
people didn't want to use it.  They were familiar with the EDIT
command, and they resisted learning something new.  What a reversal of
roles to think that the former shop standard now has to be taught to
programmers as an emergency editing tool!

      Let's get started.  EDIT is easy to invoke, but once there, it's
a bit tricky to use correctly.  I'll try to mention some helpful hints
to guide you on your way.  SYS1.HELP on every system, contains a HELP
member for the EDIT command.  If you print this member off, and have
the printed copy handy, you'll have a reference available for command
syntax.  That is very important in the absence of manuals.  If you can
get access to them, the TSO/E Command Reference and the TSO/E User's
Guide are the good manuals.  But the most important way to learn the
EDIT command is to practice editing junk datasets and pds members.

      EDIT is invoked as a TSO command in the form:

        EDIT 'dataset.name' dataset-type process-type

where "dataset-type" is a keyword expressing the data format of the
dataset or member.  Examples of dataset type can be CNTL, COBOL, ASM,
CLIST, DATA, GOFORT, PLI, TEXT, and some others.  "Process-type" tells
EDIT the processing facts it needs to know.  Examples of process-type
are NEW, OLD, NONUM (to edit a non-numbered dataset).  NEW tells EDIT
to allocate a brand-new dataset; OLD tells EDIT to look for a dataset
that already exists.

      Once you've invoked EDIT, you have to watch carefully for two
different things at all times.  First, you must always know where
the current line pointer is.  Second, you must always be aware of
whether you are in the INPUT mode or EDIT mode of operation.  INPUT
mode treats everything typed in (including commands) as new file data.
You have to be especially watchful about this because it is easy to
corrupt your files by mistakenly INPUTting images of EDIT commands,
which you'll have to delete later.

      EDIT mode allows you to enter subcommands to correct or change
data that was already in the file.  When you are in EDIT mode, you
cannot add additional data records, unless you COPY or MOVE existing
records to another place.

      Additionally, you must be aware if the dataset is numbered or
non-numbered (NONUM).  EDITing lines without sequence numbers is
harder.  It is best to start practicing with a numbered dataset.

      If you're editing a NEW dataset, you'll always enter in INPUT
mode.  If you edit an existing dataset, you enter in EDIT mode.  The
initial prompt that you're in INPUT mode is the word, "INPUT".  The
initial prompt that you're in EDIT mode is the word, "EDIT".  INPUT
mode treats everything you type, as data being inserted into a new
data record.  When ENTER is pressed in INPUT mode, and there is
non-null data on the line, that line becomes a record, and everything
typed afterward, goes onto a new line.  In this context, it's a bit
difficult to keep track of column alignment, unless you're used to it.

      All these data records will be inserted after the record being
pointed to by the current line pointer.  EDIT, especially if you
don't have sequence numbers, will not automatically tell you where
your current line pointer is.  This is a tricky thing which confuses
most people who are new to EDIT.

      You stay in INPUT mode until you enter a null line by pressing
ENTER on a new line without entering any data.  At this point, you'll
be prompted with the word, "EDIT", which tells you that you are now in
EDIT mode and you can start entering subcommands.  Pressing ENTER in
EDIT mode with no subcommand, will switch you to INPUT mode.  Pressing
ENTER in INPUT mode with no data, will switch you to EDIT mode.  Each
time you switch, you get the appropriate prompt.

      The first subcommand you should learn is LIST.  LIST without any
operands, will display the entire dataset or member on your tube, one
screen at a time.  At the completion of the display, the line pointer
will point to the last line of the dataset.  The next command is TOP,
which points the line pointer to the top line of the dataset.  BOTTOM
points the line pointer to the bottom line of the dataset.  DOWN nn
moves the line pointer nn lines toward the bottom.  UP mm moves the
line pointer mm lines toward the top.  LIST * , with no other operands,
will display the current line, and leave the line pointer where it is.
LIST * 2 , will display 2 lines at the current line pointer, and will
then move the line pointer one line down.  LIST * 3, will show 3 lines
and move the line pointer 2 lines down.  You have to play with this to
get a feel for it.

      Jeff Broido recommends that the very first time you go into EDIT
mode, you should enter the subcommand, VERIFY ON or V ON.  VERIFY ON
will prompt you each time a CHANGE command has successfully substituted
one string for another.  Otherwise, you don't get notified, though you
need to do a LIST command anyway, to see what was done.

      I don't have space to teach you how to use EDIT here and now.
The HELP members and manuals will assist you, but you have to practice
adding and deleting lines, aligning each line to the proper column,
changing strings of data, and so forth.  Once you've done that, you
should feel quite confident about (carefully) fixing PARMLIB and PROCLIB
members.  After having practiced with EDIT, you'll probably agree that
FSE is much easier.

      I hope you've had fun listening to me, and I hope you have more
fun practicing with these editing tools.  Someday, this practice will
pay you back.  See you next month.

            of editing a JCL member in a partitioned dataset.  This
            editor falls far short of having the power of the ISPF
            editor, but when ISPF will not come up, there is plenty
            of power to fix what needs fixing.  This editor is free,
            and it comes from File 207 of the CBT MVS Utilities Tape.

            command.  This is a simple but capable file editor that
            doesn't take up much room or resources.  FSE is not related
            to ISPF and doesn't need ISPF at all.  In an emergency when
            ISPF does not come up and the ISPF editor is not usable,
            editing a dataset from SYS1.PARMLIB or SYS1.PROCLIB with
            FSE can save the day.
