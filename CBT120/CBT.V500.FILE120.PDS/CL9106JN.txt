DYNAMASK - CHANGING DEVICE NAMES ON A LIVE SYSTEM IN SECONDS.

     Have you ever had to add new disk volumes or switch some volumes
around on short notice?  Did you ever convert a disk volume from another
application to TSO use, and be forced to remove it from SYSDA, so the
programmers wouldn't clog the volume up with their test files?  Were
you ever forced to divide your cartridge drives into separate esoteric
categories during production hours, to keep some of the devices clear
for high priority work?

     How many times have you told your management that these maneuvers
would require an IOGEN, or an MVSCP and an IPL?

     If you used DYNAMASK, you'd never have to give them such an
answer.  You'd simply tell them:  "Give me a minute and I'll fix it up
for you.

     DYNAMASK is found on File 400 of the CBT MVS Tape, distributed
by NaSPA (414) 423-2420, and by the Share Program Library Agency at
the University of Miami in Florida, (305) 284-6257.  DYNAMASK is also
available on the L.A. MVS Users Group Tape.  Merv Hemp (818) 841-9470
is in charge of that tape.


WHAT IS DYNAMASK?

     DYNAMASK is a program which rebuilds the "Eligible Device Table"
of MVS, using control card input to change the original table.  You
set things up in a general way, with the MVSCP.  Then you can adjust
the device name setup on the fly, more finely, with DYNAMASK.
DYNAMASK, at this writing, is completely supported through MVS/ESA
4.2.  Steve Smith of Security Pacific Automation Company, does the
support work.  (Now at SERENA International in Burlingame, CA.)

     What is the Eligible Device Table (or the EDT) in MVS.  The EDT
is an incore table that has all your general unit names.  You code the
unit names in the "UNIT=" parameter of the DD card in your JCL.  Each
unit name is associated in the EDT with a list of device addresses
which are eligible to be used with that particular unit name.  When
you ask for the unit name in your JCL, MVS uses the Eligible Device
Table to find a particular device, such as a tape drive, that fits the
requirements for the unit type you specified.

     As we said before, The EDT is generated, for pre-SP2.2 systems,
by the IOGEN process, which consists of coding assembler SYSGEN macros
to fit your unit and address configuration, and assembling them with
"GENTYPE=(IO,x)", or "GENTYPE=EDT" as a parameter in the GENERATE
macro.  For SP2.2 and later systems, the MVSCP process was created
for the purpose of separating IO-related system setup from the process
of nucleus creation.  IO-related information after SP2.2 is not in
IEANUC01, the system nucleus.  In vanilla (IBM-shipped) MVS, once the
EDT information was put out, you can't change it without an IPL. There
are lots of shops where it's hard to IPL very often.  These shops
don't have much flexibility in swapping devices around, even at
SP 2.2 or above.

     DYNAMASK can be executed, almost at any time, by starting a PROC.
DYNAMASK can create new general unit names for you, at will.  DYNAMASK
can also adjust existing unit names to include or exclude more devices
from each name.

     I'd like to mention another fact before going into the
particulars of how DYNAMASK works.  In the "UNIT=" parameter of a DD
card, one may actually hard-code a specific device unit address
number.  You can specify a particular tape drive to use, such as
"UNIT=48C".  When there are a lot of tape drives, you may not wish to
be so specific.  You may want to specify a general unit name, such as
"UNIT=TAPE" if you don't care which drive you'll get.  When an eligible
tape drive becomes available, you'll get that drive.

      There are two types of general unit names.  These are:  generic
unit names, and esoteric unit names.

      Generic unit names are device class numbers, for example:
"UNIT=3480" or "UNIT=3400-6".  Esoteric unit names are words that have
to start with alpha characters the way pds member names do.  Esoteric
names are usually created to be descriptive of the devices to which
they refer.  Some examples are:  "UNIT=CART", "UNIT=DISK3350", or
"UNIT=SYSTSO".  DYNAMASK can create new generic and esoteric unit
names, and can assign devices to them.  Your installation's unit name
structure can be made creatively interesting in short order, or
otherwise adjusted to the shop's needs.

      One more thing.  Because of release dependencies, there are two
different versions of DYNAMASK that are distributed on the CBT Tape
File 400.  The Pre-SP 2.2 version of DYNAMASK is called DYNAMSK7.  The
SP2.2 thru ESA 3.1.3 version is called DYNAMSK2.  Support for SP4.1 is
hopefully forthcoming, and is being developed at the time of this
writing.  It remains to be seen whether IBM's work on dynamic device
reconfiguration in SP4.2 will obsolete DYNAMASK, or whether DYNAMASK,
after being fitted for that SP4.2, will do the job better than IBM's
effort.


HOW IS DYNAMASK USED?

      The DYNAMASK program has to be authorized, and must be executed
from an authorized library.  DYNAMASK is generally invoked as a
started task, which accesses a card-image dataset that has its
execution parameters.  These parameters tell DYNAMASK which addresses
to move among which unitnames.  The DYNAMASK data is in the form of
commands which specify an add or delete indicator, a partial or
complete unitname, followed by (partial) addresses or volume serial
names to include or exclude.  See Figure One for a sample DYNAMASK
PROC, and Figure Two for sample data commands.

      DYNAMASK takes only a few seconds to execute.  Steve Smith
recommends (in writing) that the system should not have much activity
while DYNAMASK is running.  One day, I asked him how great that risk
was (because I needed to run DYNAMASK in the middle of the day).  He
said that during a small window, while bit masks were being moved
around, some job might try to allocate a dataset on one of the
devices being affected.  This could cause the job to have an error.
But he said the risk was not too great, and he knew of one shop that
triggered off DYNAMASK executions automatically, several times during
the day, without apparent harm.  Most usually, shops will run a
DYNAMASK procedure started by a COMMNDxx or IEACMDxx member of
SYS1.PARMLIB shortly after IPL.

      Generally, DYNAMASK is run when you have to move devices
around, where it's inconvenient to prepare different MVSCP's and
IPL.  Most shops are constrained concerning IPL's.  One bank has
an automatic teller system that has only one hour of downtime allowed
over several months.  DYNAMASK helps that system over and over again.
Most shops are not so constrained, but they find waiting for an IPL
to be constrictive, and they would rather have an alternative if one
were available.

      How do you set the DYNAMASK control cards up?  I've decided to
present the rules for DYNAMASK execution in Steve Smith's words.  See
Figure Three for DYNAMASK help information, which comes from Steve's
comments in the assembler source code.


OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED WITH DYNAMASK.

      File 400 of the CBT Tape, which contains DYNAMASK, and the
corresponding file on the L.A. MVS Users Group Tape, have other
related programs included besides the two DYNAMASK versions.
I'll quickly describe them.

      DYNASWAP provides the ability to swap all unitname EDT
affiliations of two offline devices.  Suppose one disk drive goes bad,
and you move its data to another drive.  You'd like the new drive to
behave exactly as the old one did, as programmers execute jobs against
the new pack's data.  Problem is that the new drive is at a different
address, and the unitname designations in the EDT are keyed to
addresses, not to volume serial names.  If you have a pack called
TSO001 at address 2C9, it might behave differently than a renamed pack
TSO001 at address 9A5.  DYNASWAP will flip the EDT-defined properties
of address 2C9 with those of address 9A5, if you ask it to.  Then,
the new TSO001 at 9A5 will behave in allocations, exactly as the old
one at address 2C9 did.

      UCBMASK is a program which will perform the function of the
VATLSTxx member in SYS1.PARMLIB, but that function can be done at any
time, not just at IPL time.  UCBMASK will change the mount attributes
of many disk devices at once, according to the contents of control
cards.  The control cards for UCBMASK do not follow the format of the
VATLSTxx cards.  Look in the source code documentation for UCBMASK to
learn the format of the control cards and the layout of the JCL to run
the program.

      VATUCB will read the cards in an old-style (through SP2.2.0)
VATLSTxx member and adjust the mount attributes of all those disk
volumes accordingly.  It will do the function of UCBMASK, but the
control card format is exactly that of a VATLSTxx SYS1.PARMLIB
member.  It may be possible, if an old-style VATLSTxx member is coded
for an SP2.2.3 system or higher, to execute the VATUCB program
successfully.

      SYSUNITS is a program that will report unit addresses associated
with a list of unitnames.  The SYSUNITS program can be used to verify
if the changes done by DYNAMASK are in effect.  SYSUNITS performs a
very useful reporting function in the "EDTGEN" area.


IN SUMMARY.

      The subject of the "Instant EDTGEN" is dear to the administrators
of installations who don't IPL frequently, and who move devices around
often.  The DYNAMASK program makes trivial work of an awkward MVS
construction that device ADDRESSES, and not device volume serial names,
determine membership in the community of devices defined by any
unitname.  DYNAMASK performs instant changes of unitname membership,
either by address, or by volume serial name.  No IPL is required to
execute any of these changes on an MVS system.

      The convenience of DYNAMASK, together with related programs
that are delivered with it, saves MVS installations much time, and
eliminates grief among operations and systems people alike.  DYNAMASK
is currently supported through MVS/ESA 4.2.

      I hope this knowledge will help many of you run your shops
better.  In any case, we hope to see you again next month.  Good
luck.

                   DYNAMSK2 CONTROL CARD FORMAT

      STARTING IN COLUMN 1, PUT THE UNIT NAME TO BE CHANGED OR ADDED
      FOLLOWED BY A BLANK.

      THIS IS FOLLOWED BY VOLUME(S) AND/OR UNIT ADDRESS(ES) TO BE
      ASSIGNED TO THIS UNIT NAME.  VOLUMES CAN BE SPECIFIED ONLY FOR
      DISK DEVICES FOR UNIT NAMES OF DASD ONLY.

      VOLUMES ARE OF THE FORM:  ONE TO SIX CHARACTER VOLUME IDS.
      LIKEWISE, A MODEL VOLUME OF ONE TO FIVE CHARACTERS PLUS
      AN ASTERISK WILL SELECT ALL VOLUMES THAT MATCH THE MODEL.

      UNIT ADDRESS ARE OF THE FORM: SLASH (/) AS FIRST CHARACTER,
      FOLLOWED BY THE 3 DIGIT HEXIDECIMAL UNIT ADDRESS.
      LIKEWISE A MODEL 1 OR 2 DIGIT HEXIDECIMAL ADDRESS PLUS
      AN ASTERISK WILL SELECT ALL UNITS THAT MATCH THE FIRST GIVEN
      DIGITS. A RANGE OF UNITS MAY BE SPECIFIED AS FOLLOWS /CUU-CUU


      IF MORE THAN ONE VOLUME OR UNIT ADDRESS IS NEEDED, EACH IS
      SEPARATED BY A COMMA.  IF MORE ENTRIES ARE REQUIRED THAN
      CAN BE CONTAINED ON ONE CARD, THE CARD CAN BE CONTINUED BY
      PLACING A COMMA AFTER THE LAST ENTRY.  THE NEXT CARD MUST
      BE CONTINUED ON OR AFTER COLUMN 2.

      THE SPECIFIED UNIT NAME ASSIGNMENTS NORMALLY REPLACE ALL
      PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS.  HOWEVER, IF A MINUS (-) PRECEDES
      THE UNIT NAME, THE SPECIFIED UNIT...VOLUME ENTRIES WILL BE
      EXCLUDED FROM THE EXISTING ASSIGNMENTS DERIVED FROM SYSGEN.

      IF A PLUS (+) PRECEDES A UNIT NAME, THAT UNIT NAME IS
      MARKED FOR VIO.

      AN ASTERISK (*) IN COLUMN 1 INDICATES A COMMENT CARD.
      A COMMENT CARD CAN BE PLACED ANYWHERE.

      SAMPLES:

           SYSDA SYSDA*

           SORT  SYSDA1,SYSDA2,
           * COMMENT CARD, THE NEXT CARD IS CONTINUATION OF PREVIOUS
            SYSDA3,SYSDA4

           -2400-3 /48E,/48F

           TAPE1  /42*,/5*,/440-45F

           +SYSVIO SYSDA1

      IF THE SAME UNIT NAME IS SPECIFED MORE THAN ONCE, ONLY
      THE FIRST IS USED.

      ANY ERROR OR INVALID SPECIFICATION IN A UNIT NAME CAUSES
      THAT UNIT NAME NOT TO BE UPDATED.

      ANY ERROR OR INVALID SPECIFICATION IN A UNIT ADDRESS OR
      VOLUME WILL BE IGNORED AND THE UNIT NAME WILL BE UPDATED
      WITH ANY CORRECT UNIT ADDRESSES AND/OR VOLUMES. MISSING
      VOLUMES ARE IGNORED.

      ALL UNCHANGED UNIT NAMES FROM THE SYSGEN ARE RETAINED.
      ONLY UNIT NAMES TO BE CHANGED NEED BE SPECIFIED.
