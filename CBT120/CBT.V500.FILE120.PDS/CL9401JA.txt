THE FASCINATION OF THE DISASSEMBLER - Part One.

      It's amazing that a computer works.  Even those of us who are
programmers sometimes can't believe what we are seeing, when the
computer is "strutting its stuff" while running some neat program.
Did a person really program this?  Or is there some "hidden spirit"
that looks at what we've programmed, and then does wonders with it?
Actually, the truth is that the computer really is only a machine.
But the fascination produced by this machine never ceases.

      I find this fact itself to be worthy of study.  Why are we so
emotionally taken by the workings of a computer?  This topic would
really deserve expert treatment by someone as insightful as Rod
Serling.  What inner yearning of the human spirit is stirred, when one
sees the outward workings of a computer?  What do we feel?  What does
the computer awaken within us?

      I think that a small part of the answer lies in our conceptual
inability to relate programming languages (which we think in) to the
executable load modules that control the actions of the machine.  We
do our programming with something that is language-like, whereas the
machine obeys a strange combination of binary bytes that constitute
the load module's machine instructions.

      Today, we'll spend some time thinking about the connection between
our language-like programs and the machine's binary instructions which
result from "compiling" our programs.  More specifically, we shall
discuss the reverse of the normal process.  We shall try to understand
the machine's mysterious code by attempting to convert it back to our
own assembly language, which we have a better shot at understanding.  If
we see assembly language code produced from what the machine is doing,
our fascination and pure wonder might be converted to a measure of
understanding.  This reverse process is called disassembly, and
programs which "de-compile" machine code, are called disassemblers.


The Compilation Process.

      In order to understand the de-compilation process, which is our
subject today, I have to say a few words about the compilation
process.  I'm speaking philosophically here.  Probably ninety percent
of our readership actually understands this mechanism in much more
detail, so please don't feel that your intelligence is being insulted.
Please let me go on.  The compilation process is the bridge between
our language-like computer instructions and the binary codes that make
the computer jump through its hoops.

      On an IBM mainframe system, the initial translator from our
programming language is called the compiler.  The compiler looks at
input source code, turning it into a card-image ordered collection of
machine instructions and external references called an "object deck".
While an object deck already contains actual machine instructions, it
cannot itself run on a machine.  (Let's forget about the LOADER
program for now.)  Another program called the linkage editor is
necessary to "digest" this set of instructions further, in order to
make it easier for the machine to "fetch" the program and run it.  The
output of the linkage editor, which takes input from one or more
object decks, is called a load module.  When we look at a load module
with an unpracticed eye, it looks like a bunch of gibberish to us.

      Now to the meat.  We systems programmers delve into a machine's
internal workings, software-wise.  When a problem occurs, the only
evidence we usually have is a core dump that points to load modules
and data areas.  Our problem is to look at the machine's "gibberish"
and to figure out what the machine was trying to do.  It would of very
much help to look at language instructions instead of binary machine
code.  Thus we have the need to reverse the compilation process and to
generate a source code listing, arising from machine code.  Obviously,
it's easier to automate that job, rather than to do it by hand.
Therefore, people have written "disassembler" programs.

      Our aim now is to concretely illustrate the usefulness of the
disassembly process in a practical way.  What's in it for us?  I'll
show you two "free" disassembler programs and one vendor product.
During part one, we'll speak more generally.  Subsequently, we'll
bring in more detail.  At the end of this, we should all have a much
better feel for the joy and practicality of frequent "disassembling".
Also, we'll forge a much better bond in our minds between the wondrous
actions of the machine, and the practical desires of its programmers.


The Aims of Disassembling.

      There are several clear purposes for disassembling machine
code.  These are:  comparing load modules, fitting zaps to existing
code, trying to see how code works, and changing how the code works
when you don't have the source to work from.  A fifth purpose is to
satisfy auditors.  For some reason (unknown to me) auditors who
complain that an installation doesn't have source for some essential
program, will be satisfied if they produce disassembled source.  For
a sixth application, one can employ disassembling to understand code
from object decks that are shipped with PTFs.  I'll give a few
practical examples from my own work.  But first, let me introduce you
to the disassembler programs.

      To my knowledge, two disassembler programs are found on the CBT
MVS Utilities Tape, which is distributed (but not created) by NaSPA.
These programs can be found on Files 217 and 171 of the CBT tape.  The
vendor product disassembler is part of the extremely versatile (and
comparatively inexpensive) PDSTOOLS product from SERENA in Burlingame,
California.  PDSTOOLS has an "object deck decoder" as well as a load
module decoder.  We'll see all of this next time.  Meanwhile, look at
Figure 1 which is an ISPF panel that was created by a member of my
NaSPA chapter.  That panel is part of a convenient interface to both
disassemblers that will hopefully be on the CBT MVS Tape soon.

      Before we go on, I have to say that you shouldn't use a
disassembler to violate software license agreements.  However, many
circumstances arise in a systems programmer's work, in which the
understanding of the structure of some load module makes a world of
difference in one's ability to solve the current problem.  Therefore
you need to have these tools in your arsenal, at the ready, just in
case.


Practical Examples.

      Now for a quick disassembler application to start with.  Let's
say we have two copies of a load module having different linkedit
dates, from a software vendor.  The question arises whether these two
modules are really the same, or whether there are some different bytes
in their code.  My quick way to tell, is to disassemble both modules
to two source files, and then to run a compare against these source
files.  This is an elegant, simple technique and it works very well.
After verifying that the code is the same, all you have to do is to
make sure that the two sets of load module attributes (reentrancy,
reusability, etc.) match each other.  The disassembler print files
will display all the load module attributes.  Or if you have PDSTOOLS,
you can use its ATTRIB and MAP subcommands against each load module.
Job finished.  You can also use this technique to discover where a zap
was done, by disassembling the zapped module and the unzapped one.  A
comparison of the two source decks will quickly reveal the location of
the zap.

      An extension of this technique can often be used to figure out
the logic behind a "late-model" load module.  I have saved my old XA
optional materials tapes (which contain non-OCO IBM source code for
the operating system.  These tapes contain base-level source for many
system modules.  No PTFs have modified them yet.  By assembling this
code for a given module, you'll get an idea of the logic behind how
the module works.  You have an honest assembly listing, on your own
printer's paper, complete with comments.  You are probably not running
that code on your system, however.  If the running code is not OCO,
but it is at a later maintenance level, a comparison between a
disassembly of the running code, with the assembly listing of the base
code, will usually give you a nice idea about what is really going on
with your running code.  You can get to the bottom of many software
problems in this way.

      Fitting zaps to a new version of a load module can become very
easy through disassembly.  It depends upon the circumstances, but I'll
give you an example to show how it might be done.  This example follows
File 236, on CBT Tape version 354 or higher, so you can see some machine
readable illustrations if you have a new CBT Tape.

      A friend of mine, who works as an SE for a hardware vendor, had
a customer who modified the module IDCLC01, which produces TSO "LISTC
LEVEL" displays on the tube.  The purpose of the zap was to produce a
shorter LISTC listing.  This customer's zapping point was located in
the first branch of nine similar compares and branches.  IBM changed
the logic of the compares and branches in a later release, and it
became difficult to find the proper zapping location.

      See Figure 2, which shows the original DFP release 2.4 base
code, followed by the later code, to which a similar zap was fitted,
despite the logic change to the module.  Again, the zap was a NOP
to the first branch of nine similar branches that followed each other.
Decoding of the later module with a disassembler, made it possible to
easily discover the place to put the proper zap.  And subsequent
testing showed the zap to function correctly on the later module
release.

      In our next installment, we'll continue our exposition of
disassembly examples.  However, for this time, I'd like to conclude
with some talk about of how to run the public disassemblers.


Running the Disassemblers.

      See Figure 3 for an illustration of the JCL to run both public
disassemblers.  You'll see that the JCL to run the File 217 disassembler
is much different than the JCL to run the disassembler from File 171.
The reason is that the disassembler from File 171 can use real macros
to supply assembly labels, and it must call the assembler to assemble
these macros.  A good look at Figure 3 will make this obvious to you.

      Each disassembler also comes with a detailed set of
instructions to show you how to make multiple passes and supply
labels to the disassembled code.  The File 171 disassembler can do it
from real assembler macros, as we mentioned.  However, we do not have
space to discuss the topic of multiple passes in this installment,
and we encourage you to explore that area yourselves, for now.

      Again, we hope to make the ISPF interface shown in Figure 1
available shortly.  I hope this introduction gives you a push to start
working with these disassemblers, and that this preparation will get
you ready for our next installment.  Good luck.  See you next time.

FIGURE 1.   This panel was developed by a member of our New Jersey
            NaSPA Chapter which is called SPONJ (Systems Programmers
            of New Jersey).  It is a part of his ISPF interface to
            both public domain Disassemblers.  Either Disassembler
            can be chosen from this panel.  Printout from the
            Disassemblers is browsed as a result of this invocation.

            This interface will soon appear on the CBT MVS Tape, and
            thus will be available for public use, probably by the
            time you are reading this.
