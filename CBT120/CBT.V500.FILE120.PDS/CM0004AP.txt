LEARNING ABOUT YOUR MVS SYSTEM

      MVS systems programmers have a lot in common with EDP auditors,
except that we have a difference in emphasis.  EDP auditors have the
job of finding out what's in an MVS system, without getting a lot of
outside help.  We MVS systems programmers actually set up the system, so
in that case, we know what's in it.  But sometimes, when taking a first
look at some installation's running system, we MVS sysprogs aren't in
much of a different situation than the EDP auditors.  That can be true
if we're just starting a new job, or if we're a consultant coming into
a shop for a relatively short time.  This actual skill subset of MVS
system programming--learning about the "guts" of a running system
without outside help--is actually almost identical to what EDP auditors
do every day.

      Some years ago, a noted EDP auditor, Lee Conyers, contributed two
files full of his tools, Files 220 and 221, to the CBT MVS Tape, a
huge collection of free software utilities that is publicly available.
The aim of most of Lee's tools was to get information about the running
system's essential parts, from the system itself, without outside help.
Some of the things that Lee's tools look for, are:  PARMLIB information,
lists of APF libraries, defined SUBSYSTEMS, online TAPE, DISK, terminal,
and communication devices, ENQUEUE displays, ENQUEUE contentions, and
much more similar information.  In reality, the MVS system contains all
this information in control blocks--you just have to know where to look
for it, and how to format it.  Lee's tools date from XA 2.2.3 times.
However, I've recently seen some modern, and free, packages, which work
for OS/390 systems and which display not only all the info that Lee was
looking for, but even more.  These are the tools that we're going to
talk about today.

      These remarkable publicly available packages are:  MXI from Rob
Scott, TASID from Doug Nadel, and SHOWMVS from Gilbert Saint-flour and
his helpers.  All of these three packages work under ISPF.  Each works
in a different way from the others, and all of them show a surprisingly
large amount of information about what's going on in your MVS system,
even when they're not running authorized.  Please refer to Figure 1,
as a reference to where to download these and other tools.


HOW TO GET GOING.

      MXI is the only one of these three packages which requires a
significant amount of setup.  You copy the MXI load modules into a load
library that is available to your TSO session, and you copy the MXI
panels into a library that's in your ISPPLIB concatenation.  Then you
copy the MXI table members into a library in your ISPTLIB concatenation.
If you don't want to change any defaults, all you have to do now, is to
execute the MXI load module by saying:  TSO MXI from the ISPF command
line.  The other two packages require just about no startup installation
at all.  Just copy the SHOWMVS and TASID load modules into your ISPLLIB
or TSO STEPLIB library and execute them from the ISPF command line.
TASID has the ISPF panels built into its load module, and SHOWMVS
doesn't require any panels at all.

      Then the fun begins.  All you have to do is to execute any of
the three programs by typing TSO followed by the program name (MXI,
TASID, or SHOWMVS) on the ISPF command line.  With any of these three
programs, amazing things start to happen, and you get your "EDP
Auditor's information", pretty much to your heart's content.  Let's
talk about MXI first, then TASID, then SHOWMVS.

      When you first get into MXI, you get a screen like the one shown
in Figure 2.  Most of the options are highlighted, and some might not
be.  If you're not running MXI (or one of the other two products) as an
"authorized" TSO command, some of the options will not be available,
but they are very few in number.  In MXI's case those missing options
will show, but they'll be un-highlighted.  I'll talk later about how to
run a TSO command "authorized".  Once you're in MXI's main menu, all
you have to do is to move the cursor to one of the highlighted options,
and press Enter.  You'll get a sub-display with much more detail.  In
the sub-display, the general rule is that if you move the cursor to a
highlighted field and press Enter, you'll be able to obtain another,
more specific, sub-display.

      Both MXI and TASID have excellent storage browsing facilities
which display main memory in the computer.  If an MXI display shows a
main storage address, you can usually move the cursor to it, press
Enter, and obtain a nicely formatted display of the "incore" storage.

      Take a good look at Figure 2.  At a glance, you'll see all kinds
of categories of information about your running system, that would make
an EDP auditor's mouth water.  If you want more detail, MXI seldom
disappoints you.  For example, if you want to know more information about
what load libraries are APF authorized, just move the cursor to APF on
the main menu, and press Enter.  The full list of authorized libraries
will appear on the screen.  But there's a bonus, as there is with many
of MXI's displays, and this is only a typical example.  As you know, an
APF authorized library is characterized by both a dataset name and a
volume serial of a DASD volume.  In the MXI APF display of datasets,
you can "click" (move the cursor and press Enter) on the volume serial.
Then you'll immediately get a DASD detail display, with more fields
in turn, on that display, that you can "click" on.

      So you can see that MXI's displays are not strictly hierarchical
or tree-like.  They also have a lot of internal relationships with
each other.  This makes finding information very convenient, using MXI.
My experience with MXI tells me that you have to spend time with it,
and explore your system.  There is so much information available, that
I can't mention it all here.  You have to use the product yourself.  It
is utterly fascinating.  Thanks, Rob!

      Now, on to TASID.  TASID is written by Doug Nadel, an ISPF
developer who works for IBM.  Doug wrote TASID as a tool for himself,
but since it was written on IBM equipment, it carries an IBM copyright
notice.  That's why TASID can't be put on the CBT Tape, since it's the
property of IBM.  Nevertheless, TASID is downloadable and available for
everyone to use.  See Figure 1 for the URL to get TASID, and the URLs
for all the other tools we're going to mention.

      Since Doug is an ISPF developer, you'd expect that TASID would be
coded very slickly.  It definitely is very smooth to use, and all the
panels are built in to the load module.

      Look at Figure 3, which shows the main menu of TASID.  Besides
having a choice of options at the top, the TASID main menu immediately
displays your system's IPL, configuration, and software level
information.  Like MXI, TASID is panel oriented, but TASID is more
hierarchical to operate, and doesn't cross-connect as much as MXI does.
One of the really nice features of TASID is its SNAPSHOT display, which
has the potential of showing information about many of the system's
internal characteristics and current states.  This is done via ISPF
BROWSE.  In a sense, TASID's SNAPSHOT display is somewhat similar to
what's done by Gilbert Saint-flour's SHOWMVS.  Again, TASID is a big
product, and you have to spend time exploring TASID to properly
appreciate it.

      Now our quick tour goes to SHOWMVS.  You execute SHOWMVS as a
TSO command, but SHOWMVS is different from the other two products.
Even though SHOWMVS needs ISPF to operate, it has no panels at all.

      The SHOWMVS display is presented to the terminal user through
ISPF BROWSE.  All of the information is displayed, seemingly at once,
and the SHOWMVS display can be 4000 lines long or more, on a large
system.  There is one amazing fact about the SHOWMVS display, which
makes it quite different from most datasets and objects that are ISPF
BROWSE'd.  The difference is, that the SHOWMVS display is dynamically
refreshed.  I'll tell you how.

      Some of the information presented by SHOWMVS, for example, the
dynamically obtained UCB information, takes time to gather.  Initially,
SHOWMVS presents IPL and system software level info at the top of the
display immediately, and keeps the UCB information, the Link List and
LPA List and APF List library information further down, where you can't
immediately see it, without using an ISPF FIND command.  Initially,
much of that latter information is displayed as a blank shell, and
SHOWMVS attaches a subtask, to go look for this information and
gradually refresh the BROWSE'd display.  Every time you press Enter
after SHOWMVS is running, the subtask is called, to further refresh
the screen.

      I'll illustrate.  Suppose you invoke SHOWMVS with an immediate
FIND command afterwards.  For example, invoke:

            TSO SHOWMVS;FIND 'Link-List'

The Link List datasets will display as a shell, with no DASD
informataion available yet, from the UCB's.  Then press Enter a couple
of times.  You'll see the DASD information magically appearing in the
display.  I'd bet you've never seen an ISPF BROWSE which acted like
that!

      SHOWMVS gives an enormous amount of information about your
running system and about your own TSO session.  All the information
is displayed as though it were in one big "file".  If SHOWMVS has some
difficulty obtaining some of the information to you, that component
simply doesn't display, while all the rest of the information does.
That's how it works.  You usually have to use a FIND command to find
what you're looking for.

      If SHOWMVS is running as an authorized TSO command, it'll display
more info, such as the PPT (Program Properties Table) information,
which you need APF authorization to get.  When SHOWMVS is not running
authorized, the PPT information simply isn't there.  It works the same
way with the other authorized functions.  But SHOWMVS, even running
non-authorized, will get so much information for you, that it'll
boggle your mind.  SHOWMVS uses some undocumented IBM functions to
obtain info.  For example, SHOWMVS can do a UCB scan and get the real
UCB's, not just a copy, even though it's running non-authorized.  In
my January 1996 column, I wrote about this interface, and how SHOWMVS
does this.  SHOWMVS needs the real UCB, to be able to do its dynamic
refresh of information.

      I'll conclude with a quick remark about TSO command authorization.
A TSO command is a load module.  In order for it to run with APF
authorization, several conditions have to be satisfied.  First, the load
module has to be APF authorized, having a bit set in its pds directory.
At linkedit time, you set this bit on, with the SETCODE AC(1) Linkage
Editor statement.  The free PDS 8.5 program from File 182 of the CBT MVS
Tape, or the STARTOOL vendor product from Serena, can set this bit on
dynamically, by its subcommand:  ATTRIB modname AUTH .  Next, the
module must reside in an APF authorized library.  All of the products,
MXI, TASID, and SHOWMVS, can tell you which libraries on your system
are APF authorized.  Finally, TSO has to know about the module, and
TSO has to give it authorized status.

      How does TSO "know" about running a module as an authorized
command?  TSO keeps a table in storage, that's initialized in a
PARMLIB member IKJTSOnn.  You can see this member from MXI.  Just
"click" on PARM, "click" on an active PARMLIB library, top first,
and you'll see an ISPF BROWSE member list of all the members in the
library.  BROWSE the appropriate member, and you'll see an AUTHCMD
NAMES list.  If a program is in this list, and the other two criteria
mentioned above are also satisfied, then TSO treats the command as
authorized.  If you can get permission, it will help to put MXI,
TASID, and SHOWMVS in this list.  If you can't get this permission,
and you can run your TSO session with an authorized STEPLIB library,
you can obtain your own personal TSO authorization.  I've talked
about "private TSO authorization" in my October 1995 column, and
you can find further information by downloading Files 185 and 186
from the CBT Tape web site.

      I am sure you will profit greatly from the infromation in
this month's column.  I hope to see you again, happy and smiling,
next month.

            You can see how numerous and abundant are the kinds of
            MVS system information which MXI makes available.  What
            doesn't show is the amount of detail available in the
            sub-categories which lie underneath these main

            of the active system modules.
