      This month, I am very pleased to talk about one of my favorite
topics.  Our subject concerns how nearly every MVS shop can be
equipped to VIEW JOBS AND PRINTOUT DIRECTLY FROM SPOOL.  It does not
matter whether your shop has JES2 or JES3.  The equipment is there,
and SOME VERY GOOD SOFTWARE IS FREE, TOO!  I'll hopefully show you
what the appropriate software products are, how to get them, and
some of the things they can do.

      The time-honored means of viewing job output from a TSO
session is the use of the TSO "OUTPUT" command, which can be used
for looking ONLY at completed jobs, and ONLY output which has been
queued to special "TSO-held" output classes.  The "ISPF 3.8 option"
is merely a formalization and packaging of the results of the OUTPUT
command, with the printout being written to an allocated file, and
the file ISPF-browsed.  Running jobs cannot be viewed at all.
Neither can jobs whose output was not initially queued to a "held"
output class.  In all cases using this method, "REAL SYSOUT" sitting
on the spool is not seen; only COPIED IMAGES WRITTEN FROM SPOOL to
either an allocated file, or to the terminal, are what can be
accessed by the user.  Fortunately for us in a more "modern" era,
there are better ways of looking at your jobs.

      IBM's contribution to "spool-viewing" and "spool-handling" is
called SDSF, which (depending on release) stands for "Spool Display
and Search Facility", or "System Display and Search Facility".  SDSF
works only for JES2, and is supported for all of the recent JES2
release levels.  It affords a great deal of control and usability in
looking at spool files, and it offers very considerable power for
rerouting output, changing classes and altering other parameters of
output jobs.  SDSF can also be used for VIEWING RECENT CONSOLE
MESSAGE OUTPUT of the hardcopy syslog.  It offers the nice feature
of splicing buffered SYSLOG material WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN
TO SPOOL to the end of the actual files on spool, SO THAT
UP-TO-DATE, SEAMLESS AND CURRENT CONSOLE IMAGES ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE
TO THE VIEWER.  The TSO user can thus view the current console
screens and enter MVS and JES2 commands.

      SDSF is not cheap, however, so that many shops have either
gotten another vendor product called "IOF" (Interactive Output
Facility from Triangle Systems Inc. in Research Triangle Park, NC)
which is somewhat less expensive, or have chosen the course of
"doing without".  Since IBM and (to my knowledge) other vendors have
pretty much neglected to supply similar equipment for JES3, we have
the lower-budget JES2 shops and most JES3 shops doing nothing at all
to further assist their programmers.

      THIS LATTER COURSE OF NON-ACTION IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY,
as we shall show, and I'm fairly sure that just about every MVS
shop can help itself to "view spool from spool", even for JES3.

      The JES2 "freebie" programs for viewing spool are varieties
of a program called "QUEUE".  Several flavors and variations of
QUEUE exist, and are readily available to the public.  As for all
programs of this type, a different version of the program must be
installed depending on the release level of JES2 which you have.
That's because internal format of SPOOL and checkpoint files varies
considerably from release to release.  As of the present writing,
versions of QUEUE for supported, old, and new levels of JES2
(including the ESA version 3.1) can be found on either the JES2
SHARE Mods Tape (Skip Robinson - (818) 507-3358) or on the CBT MVS
Mods Tape (Arnold Casinghino - (203) 244-5495).  There is even a
JES2 tape (that was obtainable from the now defunct "SPLA") which has
mods for "ancient" (non-SP) JES2 releases.

      The JES3 product, called "SDF" or Spool Display Facility,
runs under ISPF.  It is a very sophisticated product with large
capabilities, and IT IS FREE SOFTWARE.  SDF is supported by
Bruce Engle in the San Francisco area of California, and it can
be found (two versions) on the JES3 SHARE Mods tape (Alan Field -
(314) 839-9440).  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A "SHARE" OR "GUIDE"
MEMBER to obtain any of these tapes.  FILE15 of that tape has
an older, non-XA version of SDF, while FILE21 contains the fully
supported, modern XA version that has gone through nine release
levels in the past two and a half years.

      QUEUE, for JES2, was largely originated by Robert Jinkins,
formerly of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and now of IBM.  Its
versions have had many contributors and modifiers (including me).
In our discussion, we shall use people's names to refer to the
different versions, even though this is somewhat unusual.  However,
this is actually the way that many people think of the product.

      Plain "garden variety" QUEUE is known as "Jack Schudel QUEUE",
after good old (not so old) Jack Schudel of the University of Florida,
who is one of the premier knowledgeable non-IBM JES2 people.  It is
largely this version that I'll talk about here.  There is a somewhat
extra-featured variety known as "Leonard Woren QUEUE" (or USC QUEUE,
because Leonard Woren is at USC in California).  Leonard Woren's
QUEUE is a transformation of the older program, made to look and act
more ISPF-like in its appearance and help features.  Guy Albertelli
of B.F. Goodrich in Akron, Ohio has made ISPF-ized versions of both
"Jack Schudel QUEUE" and "Leonard Woren QUEUE".  Albertelli's
versions use ISPF browse facilities to display output, and can be run
in one split-screen of an ISPF session.  The other varieties send
their displays directly to the full terminal, and are completely
independent of ISPF.

      QUEUE is designed to be cognizant of different levels of
user authorization.  Most users can only view their own output
(jobname = userid + one character).  More privileged users can
get access to other jobs (started tasks and TSO users included)
and their associated spool files.  Installers can readily customize
authorization levels, whose programming is quite obvious in the
source code of all varieties.  If QUEUE is run as an APF authorized
program, it has more power (to requeue, cancel, and delete jobs)
than if it is running non-authorized (purely "looking" functions
only).

      Now let's look and get an overview of how these programs
work.  JES output (for both JES2 and JES3) is broken up into units
called "datasets".  Each "dataset" corresponds roughly to one DDNAME
directed to SYSOUT, or to an output produced by the operating system
for JES itself.  QUEUE and SDF both, concentrate on displaying
individual JES datasets, one at a time, rather than concatenating
them together, as do paper printouts and ISPF option 3.8.  This is
about the only flaw in QUEUE, that it cannot display all the JES2
datasets for a job, concatenated together.  BUT IT CAN ALLOW THE
VIEWING OF JUST ABOUT ANY PART OF A JOB THAT IS SITTING ON A SPOOL
FILE, EVEN IF THE JOB IS NOT COMPLETE, AND IT DOES NOT MATTER
WHETHER OR NOT THE SYSOUT IS IN A "HELD" CLASS.  ANYTHING ON SPOOL
CAN BE VIEWED (even JES2 control blocks) if it is there.  That is
the advantage of the programs of this type.

      We shall first discuss the JES2 products called QUEUE, and
then we'll mention some features and capabilites of the JES3 product,
SDF.  I myself run a JES2 shop, so that the JES3 readers should
endeavor to fill in more of the details about SDF for themselves.

      The standard QUEUE TSO-command has four HELP screens, which
have been presented in Figure 3.  The word HELP, or ANY INVALID
COMMAND, will invoke the first HELP screen.  Successive ENTER
commands will step the user through the rest of the screens in a
cycle.  These screens contain the commands to exploit the
considerable capabilities of the program.  My aim here is to lead
the user through some of the everyday commands for normal use, just
so you see some of what QUEUE will let you do.  The finer details
can largely be discovered from the commands in the help figures.

      The "starter" commands, from the first help screen, are STAT
(or ST), LIST (or L), and PDDB.  With these three commands, you can
begin looking at jobs.

      STAT lists all jobs, TSO users, and started tasks beginning
with the letters you supply.  For example, "ST TS" would show all
jobs, STCs and TSO users whose names begin with the letters "TS".
From this list, JOB NUMBERS are displayed, and if you are interested
in looking at a certain job (if the name is not unique), the job
number can be used.

      PDDB displays ALL JES2 DATASETS CONNECTED WITH A GIVEN JOB.
For example, the command "PDDB 3438" would yield a list of output
datasets connected with JOB 3438 (or TSO 3438, or STC 3438) if such
a job, STC, or TSO user exists in that JES2 system.  Figure 1 will
illustrate the result of a PDDB command.  From the figure, it is
clear that dataset id (or DSID) 102 contains the main output of the
program that has run.  To see this output, we enter "LIST 3438 102",
or "L * 102", where "*" means 'the current job'.  Since we had
previously entered the "PDDB 3438" command, QUEUE 'knows' that 3438
is the current job.

      Now suppose we wanted to check the condition code of the job
steps.  We enter a LIST command for DSID 4, the "substitution JCL
and run messages" dataset id.  The command would be:  "L 3438 4".
Having obtained this dataset id, we could issue a FIND command for
the word "CODE", which will usually show a line containing a step
condition code.  An even better means of using QUEUE to display all
the step condition codes is with the 'find all' command called "FALL".
If we issue "FALL CODE", we obtain ONLY THE OUTPUT LINES CONTAINING
THE STRING "CODE".  See Figure 2 for an example illustrating a
multi-step job.

      QUEUE can display all non-held OUTPUT with the command "DO",
which means 'display output'.  HELD OUTPUT is displayed with the
command "HO".  Current jobs running in initiators are shown with
the command "XI".  Jobs either running, or awaiting an initiator,
are shown by the command "DI" (or 'display input').  Any dataset id
currently being displayed by QUEUE can be hardcopy printed with the
command "SPIN" (to spin off output to a local printer).  The
currently displayed dataset id can be written to a disk dataset with
the "SAVE" command.  The SAVE command needs operands.  For example,
"SAVE AB CD" would write the DSID being displayed to a new dataset
(on a STORAGE volume) called 'userid.AB.CD'.  If only one operand is
supplied to the SAVE command, the second operand is assumed to be
'DATA'.  Therefore, "SAVE AB" would save the DSID to the new
dataset:  'userid.AB.DATA'.  If that dataset name is already
cataloged, or exists on the storage volume, the message:
        " *** UNABLE TO ALLOCATE DATASET ***
will appear.  The user need only to enter another SAVE command, this
time specifying a completely new dataset name, and that DSID will be
saved to the new name.

      (In Leonard Woren QUEUE and in the JES3 product SDF, "COPY"
is the command equivalent to "SAVE".)

      Besides doing ordinary displays, QUEUE can do other things.
The recent system console messages residing on JES2 spool can be
shown using the command:  "SLOG".  This command will display the
contents of the current DSID for the SYSLOG task.  Most recent
messages from the console, which are still in buffers in memory, and
which have not yet "made it" to the spool, will not be shown by the
QUEUE program; QUEUE can list only data on the JES2 spool.  IBM's
SDSF WILL show that data, as I mentioned before.

      More esoteric things that QUEUE will show are JES2 control
blocks, for example:  the JQEs, IOT, JCT, JOEs, and HCT save area
for a job.  Any block from SYS1.HASPACE can be displayed in hex and
EBCDIC, with the command "XB", if you know its location.  Some of
these locations are shown in the PDDB display (Figure 1).  Thus, the
command, "XB 02052305" will display the block on spool, containing
the original JCL of the job 3438 shown in the figure.

      QUEUE can be invoked to look at spool belonging to a different
active JES2 system or belonging to a system that is down.  We have an
MVS TEST system that runs VIRTUAL=VIRTUAL under VM.  Most of the
time, that system is down.  Even when it is up, I often don't even
have to bring up TSO under that Test System.  What I do is, I edit
the jobs I want to submit using my regular MVS system's TSO, and save
those jobs to disk.  Then I submit the jobs from the Test System by
using TSSO (Time Sharing Subsystem Option - Version 4.3 from the CBT
MVS Mods tape - file 401) using the Test System OPERATOR CONSOLE.  To
look at the jobs, I run QUEUE from MY NORMAL TSO, but POINTED TO THE
CHECKPOINT FROM THE TEST VOLUME SPOOL.  It works fine.  I can't
requeue or delete any jobs from there, but then, I have the Test
System Console to do that from.

      I once solved a tough JES2 routing problem by using QUEUE to
display a job's JCT.  Since the routing information for the job is
contained in that JES2 control block (not to be confused with MVS's
JCT control block), I could figure out the ultimate destination of
the output without actually letting it fly over the network.

      People trying to write a JES2 EXIT 6 routine (internal text
scan) will gain invaluable help from QUEUE, which displays internal
text for a job (it is DSID number 5 for every job).  This internal
text can be written to a disk dataset with the SAVE command, and
studied, for the purpose of writing the exit.

      I have to conclude my treatment of QUEUE here, because of space
considerations.  The version we have described is Jack Schudel's
QUEUE, which is available for many different releases of JES2, and
which is probably the most clean and standard version.  In Jack
Schudel QUEUE, you can literally "go from anywhere to anywhere" with
one command, since there is no hierarchy structure defined.  Leonard
Woren tried to introduce an ISPF-like appearance to QUEUE, and he
optionally preserves quite a bit of what you are currently doing, so
that the user can explore the structure of a job by stages, first
looking at the DSIDs (Leonard changed the PDDB command to just "DD")
and then LISTing them directly with LINE COMMANDS from the "DD"
screen.  Leonard also changed the HELP structure to consist of a full
screen of tutorial for each separate command. I really don't have more
space to devote to QUEUE here.  I can only implore our esteemed
readership to obtain the tapes, install the QUEUEs, and explore. It
will be rewarding.

      Now for the JES3 people.  SDF is a marvelous product that does
for JES3 users, something equivalent to what SDSF and QUEUE combined,
do for JES2 users.  For the XA version (the really sophisticated one),
Bruce Engle has gone through nine releases in the past two and a half
years!  I am including (Figure 5) a list of some of his upgrades
throughout the nine releases.  This will give the JES3 people some
material to look at, that will show them what SDF can do.  I must
apologize again that I cannot run SDF at my (JES2) shop, but I'll
make an attempt to mention some of its capabilities.

      SDF is a TSO command processor which runs as an ISPF dialog.
As its primary dialog menu (Figure 4) shows, SDF contains complete
queue search, job display, and output display facilities.  It has the
ability to display a copy of the JES3/MVS consoles and enter console
commands, and it has an interface to the TSO/E TRANSMIT/RECEIVE
functions.  In addition, it has access to the JES3 Job Zero output,
which is produced by internal JES3 functions, and which is unique to
JES3.

      ISPF browse facilities are used throughout SDF operation.
Output requeue, cancel, transmit, and copy (or save to disk or
sysout) are conveniently done, and are easily available.  The
facilities are very extensive, and users have told me that SDF is
very easy to use, besides having such full function.

      Space is limited for me here to further enumerate details of
SDF operation.  I will include a list of some of the recent
enhancements to the product, so that a JES3 user, who is involved
in the details, can get an idea of what has been added, and can
learn more particulars of what the product can do.  This material is
shown in Figure 5.

      Good luck with trying these helpful products.  If you don't
have some "spool-browse" software of this type installed, I'm
absolutely certain that an investigation of these products will yield
much reward for your shop, and the gratitude of many users.

    allow the user to optionally prompted with a confirmation panel
    whenever a request is issued to delete all output or cancel a job.

o   User may now specify 'STC' in userid field to search for started
    tasks or 'JES3' in userid field to search for JES3 DSP jobs.

o   New MAP parameter and MAP command to display a storage map of SDF
    entry points and data areas. Enables SDF execution to be traced
    under VM using CP TRACE command.

o   SDF now supports record lengths greater than 255.

o   Performance and buffer handling improvements.  QSAM I/O has been
    converted to BSAM.

o   Support included for JES3 2.2.1.

VERSION 2.5 - 01/88

o   New option 'L' to list all step completion codes and summary
    messages for job from the job selection list.

o   User may now specify a print class for the 'P' print option on the
    job selection list by entering 'Pc' where 'c' is the output class.

o   New SKIP command which allows the user to skip between data sets
    from within ISPF browse.

o   New FORMAT field on job selection list and data set selection list
    panels to specify display format.

o   Data set selection list now has three formats: SHORT/LONG/XLONG.
    SHORT form includes SYSOUT data sets only.

o   SORT command now allows specification of either ascending or
    descending sequence.

VERSION 2.4 - 10/87

o   New UPDATE command to update status of all jobs on the current job
    selection list without rereading the entire JCT.

o   Changed to retain purged jobs on job selection list (in *PURGED
    status) until UPDATE or REFRESH command is issued.

o   New SNAP command to take a snap dump for diagnostic purposes from
    any panel while in SDF.

o   New TUTORIAL command to access the SDF tutorial from any panel while
    in SDF.

o   Copy, transmit, and reprint functions now allow the user to copy
    selected portions of a data set by line number.

o   Copy, transmit, and reprint functions now allow the user to copy
    data from one job to multiple locations. It is no longer necessary
    to exit from the data set selection list and enter it again.

o   RACF and ACF2 versions of user exits combined into common source
    members.

o   New expanded parameter lists passed to security exits.

o   SDF now checks the security user id for a job as well as the
    submitting TSO user id for access authorization.

o   SDF now requires a Type 3 SVC (SDFSVC).

VERSION 2.3 - 07/87

o   Added ISPF REFRESH command to refresh data set contents from within
    ISPF browse.

o   Esoteric unit name for temporary browse data set may be specified by
    the user on the SDF Parms panel.

o   Improved formatting of JCT in control blocks display.

o   Added FRP, JVT, DJST, and dynamic allocation JST to control blocks
    display.

o   SDF may now be called recursively from within SDF.

VERSION 2.2 - 04/87

o   Added new console display function which dynamically displays SYSLOG
    messages in a scrollable area and allows authorized users to enter
    JES3 commands.

o   New RETRIEVE function for recalling up to 8 previous JES3 commands
    to the command line as in VM.

o   New AUTO command to set automatic scrolling on console display.

o   New FIND command which allows user to search for character strings
    in the console display buffer.

o   New LOCATE command which allows user to scroll to a specified time
    location within the console display buffer.

o   Added new options to place jobs on hold and to release jobs from
    hold.

o   Improved format for control blocks display.  Each control block
    section is now displayed separately.

o   Modified the spool I/O interface to operate in key 1 to prevent
    conflicts with writer FSS address spaces.

o   SDF now validates all spool data being read to ensure that it still
    belongs to the job being accessed.

VERSION 2.1 - 03/87

o   New option which allows the user to cancel jobs in DJC net hold.

o   New option to browse SRF/MRF spool files from main selection panel.

o   Allow specification of default destinations for PRINT and FICHE
    requeue options.

o   Changed to use subtask for all requeue/delete/cancel/purge functions
    instead of generating TSO commands.

VERSION 2.0 - 01/87

o   SDF now disallows some options/commands when accessing spool from
    another JES3 complex.

o   Output processing options are now available directly from the job
    selection list (options O, DH, DW, MH, and MW).

o   The SDF main selection panel is now displayed from within the SDF
    program. This allows access to all SDF functions by issuing the TSO
    SDF command.

o   All load modules are now reentrant and are linked as REFR,RENT,REUS.

o   All load modules can now reside above the 16mb line and are linked
    as AMODE=31,RMODE=ANY.

o   SDF now correctly handles spool volumes that have been removed
    without a JES3 cold start, both when accessing the user's JES3
    complex and when accessing another JES3 complex.

o   When accessing spool on the user's system, I/O is performed by the
    subtask using the JES3 block I/O service. The I/O subtask performs
    an asynchronous read-ahead of spool data sets into chained buffers.
    This results in a marked speed improvement.

o   SDFCOPY now calculates BLKSIZE and BUFNO values for the temporary
    data set.  For devices with track sizes less than 32K, full-track
    blocking is used. Half-track blocking is used for other devices.

o   New internal trace table for debugging purposes.  Trace table is
    activated by the TRACE parameter.
