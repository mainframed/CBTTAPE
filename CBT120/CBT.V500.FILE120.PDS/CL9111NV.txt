EXPLOITING PARTITIONED DATASET DIRECTORY FIELDS:  PART III.


INTRODUCTION TO PART III.

      Much dataset activity related to MVS computing deals with the
partitioned dataset structure.  The partitioned dataset, which can
be pictured as the "generalized library" construct under MVS, consists
of a directory with "member names", followed by the member data
itself.

      The partitioned dataset directory entries can play a large part
in MVS program execution when the partitioned dataset is a "load
library".  Members of a "load library" pds are the disk storage copies
of executable programs, known as "load modules".

      The information necessary to execute a load module under MVS is
not all contained in the data portion itself.  Essential program
loading information used by the MVS "program fetch" component, is
stored in pds directory "user fields" that we talked about in the first
two parts of this series.  Today we shall conclude our pds directory
discussion with a look at load module directory "user" fields that can
crucially affect program execution.


A STRUCTURAL SUMMARY.

      We stated in the previous installments that a pds directory
entry has 12 required bytes, and up to 62 optional "user" bytes.
The required bytes are:  8 bytes - member name, 3 bytes - start
TTR location of member data, and 1 byte - 3 bits of flags, and 5 bits
stating the number of halfwords of user bytes (from 0 to 31 halfwords)
in this directory entry.  See Figure One for details.

      Before getting to look at a load module, I'd just like to
summarize the "physical" and "logical" structures of partitioned
dataset directories.  These are the "directory block" (physical) and
"directory entry" (logical) structures respectively.

      Directory blocks have a FIXED DCB structure of RECFM (F),
KEYLEN (8) and BLKSIZE (256), regardless of the DCB structure of the
data portion (the pds MEMBERS).  This makes each directory block 264
characters in length, which is inflexible.  Within a directory block,
however, there might be several "directory entries" that can vary
considerably in structure.  A single directory block can contain as
many complete directory entries as will fit into the block.  Overflow
cannot be tolerated; a directory entry cannot span two blocks.

      Since individual directory entries may vary in size, there is
no fast rule as to how many entries will fit into a directory block.

      All member names in a pds directory are sorted in ascending
collating sequence.  The 8-byte KEY of each directory block contains
the member name of the highest member whose entry is in that block.
The first DATA byte of any directory block is a binary one-byte value
that indicates the length of meaningful directory entry data in each
block (not counting itself).  The value in this byte may go from X'00'
(decimal 0) to X'FF' (decimal 255).

      One practical result of this information:  It might pay NOT to
keep ISPF statistics for the members of your ISPF panel libraries.
Without statistics (which make each directory entry bigger), more
directory entries can be packed into each directory block.  ISPF
response time may be noticeably decreased for large panel libraries,
because fewer physical blocks have to be searched to find a given
member, and ISPF dialogues involve a lot of panel searches.

      When you allocate a partitioned dataset it is important to allow
enough directory blocks to hold your member data.  Rather than
reallocating a new dataset with more directory blocks when the
directory is full, tools exist which allow expansion of pds directories
to create more directory blocks "on the fly".

      One of the best tools is the PDS Program Product (Version 8.4)
on File 182 of the CBT MVS Tape (obtainable from NaSPA (414) 423-2420
or SPLA (305) 284-6257 for a handling charge).  The "PDS Product" has
a subcommand ("FIXPDS EXPANDDIR (nnn)" ) that will accomplish dynamic
directory block expansion or reduction in a pds rather effortlessly,
with almost no environmental impact.  This tool and its vendor-supported
successor, PDS/E Sysprog Utilities (if you already have it), can
simplify and automate any of the directory entry manipulations we
will talk about here, accurately making these changes for single or
multiple members at a time.  Both products have a command called
"DIRENTRY" which displays and formats directory entries.  See Figure
Two for a DIRENTRY display.


MANIPULATION OF A LOAD MODULE DIRECTORY ENTRY.

      At this point we can show how to flip some bits in a load module
directory entry and get some results.

      You'll need a tool to do the bit flipping.  Take your choice.
You can use IBM's superzap (AMASPZAP) from SYS1.LINKLIB if you know how
to display the location of the directory blocks before making changes
to them.  My favorite tool for bit flipping is the UCLA fullscreen ZAP
program from the CBT MVS Utilities Tape:  Files 134, 135, or 300,
which has a string "find" facility.  The PDS Program Product
"ATTRIBUTE" subcommand, with keywords, will accomplish the desired
effect more accurately without direct zapping.  I don't care how you
flip the bits.  I'll just show you what bits to flip.

      Look at the load module in Figure Two, named CNMCNETV.  This
load module is reentrant, reusable, and authorized.  For argument's
sake, suppose that reentrancy were not desired (perhaps we made a
mistake in the linkedit parms).  Let's look at Figure One to see where
"reentrancy" is shown.  We could turn off the "reentrant" attribute by
going into the first attribute byte at +14 into the directory entry,
turning off the B'10000000' bit.  The value X'C3' at +14 would be
changed to X'43'.  The load module would then be "reusable" and
"authorized" only.

      Often, "reusability" is on when "reentrancy" is turned on during
linkage editing.  Possibly reusability is also not desired for our
module.  By referring to the DSECT description in Figure One, we see
that the reusability attribute for the load module is indicated by the
B'01000000' bit at +14 into the directory entry.  We'll turn off the
reusability bit, now changing the contents of the first attribute byte
from X'43' to X'03'.  You get the idea.

      Authorization of a load module results from using the linkage
editor control card "SETCODE AC(1)" during linkage editing.  (For the
module to actually execute authorized, its load library must be an
authorized library.  The library must be in an authorized LINKLIST
concatenation, or it must appear in the APF authorization table of
SYS1.PARMLIB at IPL time, or be SYS1.LINKLIB or SYS1.SVCLIB on the
active res pack.)

      As you can see from Figure One, the location of the
authorization byte (ON is X'01' and OFF is X'00') may vary sharply
depending on some other factors.  If the module is an ALIAS, is
"scatter loaded", or if it contains a "System Status Indicator" (an
"SSI"), the displacement of the authorization byte into the directory
entry will be different.  For a given load module, you have to
examine the DSECT in Figure One carefully to determine where the
authorization byte is, before attempting to turn it on or off.

      All this knowledge is useful, and it can be extremely helpful in
some emergency situations, but doing such bit flipping accurately can
be cumbersome and somewhat error prone.  Practically speaking, you can
use the "PDS Program Product" from the CBT Utilities Tape, or the
"PDS/E" product if you have it.  You can point "PDS" to the load
library containing your modules, and issue its "DIRENTRY" and
"ATTRIBUTE" subcommands.

      For example (using load module CNMCNETV), to turn off reentrancy,
enter:  "ATTRIB CNMCNETV NORENT".  To turn off reusability, enter:
"ATTRIB CNMCNETV NOREUS".  And to turn off authorization, just enter:
"ATTRIB CNMCNETV NOAUTH".  These parameters may be combined:  "ATTRIB
CNMCNETV NORENT NOREUS NOAUTH" will turn all those attributes off at
once.  The ATTRIBUTE subcommand of "PDS" can turn ON linkedit
attributes as well:  "ATTRIB CNMCNETV RENT REUS AUTH" will turn all of
these attributes on, accurately.

      Please study the two illustrations thoroughly, because much
information is contained in them.

      Good luck in all your work.  I hope to be seeing you next
month.
