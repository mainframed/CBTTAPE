ABOUT DATASET BLOCK SIZES AND I/O EFFICIENCY - PART I.

      I am sure all of you realize that most MVS shops are both the
same and different.  They are the same, in that our skills, developed
at one site, can be largely used at another site without much
modification--the type of work is similar at all sites.  They are
different, in that the actual hardware configurations and workload
patterns can vary widely.  IBM and "third party" software that exists
in one place can be absent at another.  Performance situations that
are everyday occurrences in one shop, might never have happened in
the entire history of a second shop.

      So, in talking about block sizes of datasets, one can only make
rather general remarks, leaving it to the individual system programmers
to see what applies in their own situations.


A BIT OF BACKGROUND.

      Dataset management concerns data on disks, but the overriding
concern about datasets is usually the efficiency of I/O operations to
and from the data.  The speed at which the day's work is done, is most
often more important than squeezing the last free byte out of available
disk storage.

      System programmers need to know how to plan the use of disk
storage for I/O efficiency.  Even a "system managed" storage
environment can be mis-managed, causing needless expense and work
delays.  Since we system programmers still set up all disk-space
environments, even today, we must become more familiar with the
factors affecting their performance.  We must also be very aware of
things which can go wrong.

      Block sizing has traditionally been a balancing act.  Small
blocks waste a lot of disk space.  Large blocks can often be used
efficiently once they are read into central storage, but waste-causing
factors might also make a large blocksize into a poor choice as well.

      From the point of view of pure disk pack utilization (percent of
available track space used by a given block size), a tool such as the
BLKDISK utility (also called BLK3350, BLK3380, and BLK3390), can
quickly show you a panorama of alternatives.  See Figure 1 for an
illustration of what BLKDISK will show.  Using such a tool, you can
quickly weigh the space usage of any block size on a given disk pack
type, without having to do laborious calculations.  BLKDISK is a
public domain tool available on File 296 of the CBT MVS Utilities Tape
distributed by NaSPA (414-423-2420) or by SPLA (305-284-6257).

      We shall go a bit deeper here.  My friend Rick Fochtman has
done some studies about I/O efficiency that I've found to be both
interesting and helpful.  I'll attempt to convey some of his
findings to you.  Please be aware that any errors in "transmission"
are mine, and not his.

      Rick Fochtman's contention is that for any type of sequential
dataset access nowadays (since SAM-E), especially when allocating by
TRACKS, the most efficient I/O should be attained by blocking 5 blocks
to a track.  I'll try to explain some of the concepts behind his
reasoning.


SOME "MAGIC NUMBERS".

      The Input-Output Subsystem (or "IOS") is a part of the MVS base
product which handles the nitty-gritty or "low-level" disk access
operations.  The higher levels, "READs and WRITEs" which are
understandable to most programmers, are the domain of the "access
methods" in "DFP" (Data Facility Product), which is the
data-management add-on to base MVS.  For maximum efficiency of
input-output operations to disk files, the designers of the access
methods decided some years ago, that every disk-file "read" should
best default to five buffers.  In JCL, this would be specified by
saying "BUFNO=5" in each disk DD card.  The higher-level access
methods in DFP specify "BUFNO=5" as the default for sequential disk
access.

      That's very important.  Simply, it means that every time you
do a disk read, the system tries to fill five buffers.

      It's becoming clear now, why 5 blocks to a track might be
especially good.  The reason is that when you ask for a logical
record, SAM (sequential access) decides when to go out and ask for
more buffers of data.  SAM buffer management, by default, works
in groups of 5 buffers.  Everything SAM does is in groups of five,
with the exception of BSAM (where the programmer has complete control,
but where one could lose much efficiency).  You can fill all these 5
buffers in one sweep of a track, without having to skip tracks.
Skipping tracks is wasteful.  We hope to explain why, further on.

      You can argue (rightly) that skipping tracks is inefficient
only if you allocate your datasets on a TRACK boundary.  What if you
allocate them on a CYLINDER boundary?

      The problem with cylinder allocation is that for small datasets,
it's wasteful of disk space.  Rick's studies and experience have told
him that cylinder allocation is usually helpful for datasets of 3
cylinders and larger.  Besides, he has found through detailed tracing
that dataset access efficiency for track-allocated datasets blocked
5 blocks to a track, is nearly identical to efficiency for datasets
allocated on cylinder boundaries.

      So this "5 blocks to a track" blocking seems to be a good
"magic number" because of the design of IOS and the access methods.
If you do some calculations of disk-space usage, (or you look at the
BLKDISK output in Figure 1) you'll see that five blocks to a track
on a 3380 device isn't significantly more wasteful than 2 blocks to
a track.  That's because modern disk devices have big tracks.


TO GO ON.

      I'll have to continue this discussion next month, but we have
some big plans.  I want to talk more about access methods, and about
how sizable performance gains can be obtained through maximizing
channel usage.  (If you still use ISAM, get rid of it and use VSAM.)
I'll try to really get into I/O issues.

      Meanwhile, I hope this has been helpful.  Good luck.  See you
next month.
