EXPLOITING PARTITIONED DATASET DIRECTORY FIELDS - PART I.

      This month, I'd like to talk about utilizing information
contained in partitioned dataset directory entries.  The fields and
bits in the directory, especially in the directory entries of a load
module library, contain crucial information that is used by the MVS
operating system.

      Knowing about these fields can help you in some startling ways.
It may not have occurred to you to look in such a place for help in
problem situations.  That's why I thought it appropriate to mention
the subject here in the "tools and tricks" column, rather than in a
separate tutorial article.  We shall try to point out some cases where
information from directory entry fields will make a great impact on
our effective work as systems programmers.

      As is well known, "source-type" partitioned datasets have very
different directory entries than do "load libraries" which contain
executable load modules as their members.  We therefore shall discuss
these different types of partitioned datasets separately,
concentrating in areas where the most "gain by manipulation" is to be
had.  We shall discuss "source-type" pds members that have "ISPF
statistics" in their directory entries as opposed to members that
don't have stats.  This subject will be continued next month.


FUNDAMENTALS - THE STRUCTURE OF PARTITIONED DATASET DIRECTORIES.

      The partitioned dataset directory is located at the beginning
of the first disk extent for a partitioned dataset.  Although the DCB
attributes of the DATA in a partitioned dataset will vary, the external
physical structure of the DIRECTORY does not vary.

      The directory of a pds consists of "directory blocks" and
"directory entries".  The directory blocks of a pds may be
conceptualized as the "physical" part of the pds directory.  Considered
as raw data, each directory block is of fixed length, and is 255 bytes
long with a 9-byte key--264 bytes in all.  The size of a directory
block is fixed by the architecture of partitioned datasets, and is not
subject to user software control, for all practical purposes.

      Each directory block contains a number of directory entries of
variable length.  The directory entries, in contrast to the directory
blocks, may be pictured conceptually as the "logical" part of the
directory data.  We say "logical", because the contents of the
directory entries is variable, and is subject to much more software
control.  Our discussion will be concerned with directory entries,
which contain information that is useful for our needs as programmers.

      There is exactly one directory entry for each member of a
pds.  Each directory entry defines an area of data in the physical
pds data extents, as belonging to one member.  A pointer field in the
pds directory entry points to the start of each member, while an EOF
(end-of-file) marker in the data itself, defines the end of that
member.

      Some fields of each directory entry are required by pds design.
These fields constitute the first 12 bytes of any directory entry.  An
example of a required field is the TTR pointer in the directory entry
which points to the start of that member's data.  The 'TTR' is the
"relative track and record number for a data record, starting from the
beginning of the dataset".

      Another required field is the 8-byte member name in the
directory entry.  Every pds directory has to contain a member name and
a TTR pointer to the beginning of that member's data.  The last
required field in a directory entry is a flag byte.  Descriptions of
the required flag byte will be found in the Figures.  The required
fields may, or may not, be followed by user-defined directory entry
fields of variable length, to a maximum of 62 bytes.

      User fields, while not required by general pds structure, are
created by an MVS component which uses the pds structure as a base for
its own requirements.  The most notable example of MVS component
use of user fields, is the load library, whose "data" consists of
executable programs, or "load modules".

      PDS directory entries for load library members contain far more
'required' user fields than do most other pds directory entries.  The
MVS component called "program fetch" utilizes those extra load library
directory entry fields to affect program execution of the load module.

      In this article we will learn how to take advantage of the
accessibility of these directory entry fields to us.  We may be able
to fix load modules, for example, without having to re-linkedit them.
Merely flipping one or more directory entry bits could accomplish the
fix that we need.


SOME QUICK EXAMPLES.

      Let's whet your appetite by showing a few examples.  Load module
linkedit attributes are all reflected in the directory entry user
fields.  If you were linkediting a module, and you forgot to mention
'RENT' in the linkedit parms, you need only go to the 'reentrancy' and
'reusability' bits of the module's directory entry and turn those bits
on.  That will have the same effect as if the linkage editor turned
them on when it was creating the member.  Similarly, if a module had
to be authorized, and you forgot to say "SETCODE AC(1)" in the linkage
editor control statements, you need only go to the directory entry of
the module and turn the proper "auth" bit on.  In all of these cases,
you do not have to re-linkedit the module.  Similar considerations
apply if those attributes needed to be turned off.  Knowing these
facts can save you a lot of work.


HOW TO START LEARNING ABOUT DIRECTORY ENTRY FIELDS.

      The macro IHAPDS (in SYS1.AMODGEN) describes many (but not all)
types of pds directory entry fields.  You can find a description of
many directory entry fields in the IBM manual, "SPL Debugging
Handbook" under entries:  "PDS" and "PDS2".  In MVS/ESA, the
equivalent manuals are:  "MVS/ESA Diagnosis: Data Areas".  Because in
many cases, directory entry fields are user-defined or
application-defined, a single IBM descriptive macro cannot cover all
the ground.  In particular, ISPF directory entry field descriptions
are not too readily available (see Figure Three).

      I am providing some descriptions of directory entry fields here.
(See Figures One thru Three).  These descriptions were taken from the
source member @DIALOG of the PDS product Version 8.4, on the CBT MVS
Utilities Tape, File 182.  It is hoped that these descriptions will be
sufficient to help the reader learn this material.

      Let's begin by learning about the required directory entry
fields.  These comprise 12 bytes.  In other words, a single directory
entry has to be at least 12 bytes long.  The first eight bytes of a
directory entry consist of the member name, left justified.  It is
necessary that all directory entries be sorted ascendingly in member
name order.  Therefore, some directory entries need to be rearranged
each time a new member is added.  This is an overhead-consuming
process.  The next 3-byte field is a relative TTR pointer to the
beginning of that member's data.  Finally, there is a 1-byte field,
"officially" consisting of binary flags.  This flag byte is crucial to
the rest of the directory entry, so we shall study this byte in more
detail.

      Look at Figure Two.  The high-order bit, X'10000000' of the flag
byte, is turned on to mark the member as an alias member.  Strictly
speaking, although the purpose of an alias member is to provide an
alternate name for a main member, any pds member can theoretically be
flagged as an "alias" if this bit is on.  For load modules, the alias
bit on will be accompanied by a user field (the "real member name"
field) containing the name of a "main member", filled in by the
linkage editor at the time of alias creation.

      The next two bits, X'01100000', are relevant to load module
directory entries.  All load modules contain one extra TTR location,
which is the TTR of the first TEXT record, needed by MVS program
fetch.  For certain load modules such as OVERLAY modules and SCATTER
LOADED modules, extra control records must be available to ensure their
proper functioning.  Notelist tables (for OVERLAY) and scatter tables
(for SCATTER) may be imbedded amongst the load module text data.  In
order to be found, these tables need an extra TTR pointer in user
fields of the module's directory entry.  The second bit of the flag
byte, turned on, denotes that two extra TTR pointers need to be
constantly updated for the load module member.  The third bit on,
denotes that only one extra TTR pointer needs to be continually kept
track of for that member.

      The last five bits in the flag byte denote a binary quantity
that varies from 0 thru 31.  That denotes the number of halfwords of
user data which will be appended to the required 12 bytes of the
directory entry.  This is clear enough.  As many as 62 bytes of user
data may be added to the minimum 12 bytes.


ISPF STATISTICS IN A SOURCE-TYPE MEMBER.

      A pds member that was edited by the ISPF editor, receives
"ISPF statistics" in its directory entry when the member is saved.
The statistics consist of 28 extra bytes of user data appended to
the first 12 bytes.  When ISPF statistics are present, required flag
bits X'00001111' might be turned on; also bits X'01110000' should be
turned off.  This should be a fairly accurate test for the presence
of ISPF statistics.  (Hint is courtesy of Steve Smith).

      These statistics (or most of them) are displayed during an
ISPF member listing for non-load type members, and are familiar to
many of us.  A DSECT-type description of the "ISPF" user directory
fields is at the bottom of Figure Three.  During study of Figure
Three, it will become apparent how to change any of the statistics in
the directory.   We must somehow be able to display them in their
native format, and then zap the changes in.   ISPF Option 3.5, which
changes the contents of some of these directory fields, actually does
this zapping for us.

      Source-type pds members that don't have ISPF stats, usually
have just 12-byte directory entries, with the lower five bits of the
required flag byte set to zeros.  It is apparent that the process of
adding ISPF statistics to a member that didn't have them, is not
trivial.  A re-creation of the directory entry, possibly through the
use of the STOW macro, becomes necessary.  Directory space consumed,
for the same number of members, will have to increase noticeably.

      We've come to the end of our time for this month.  Next month,
I'll go into more detail about the STOW macro, ISPF statistics
alteration, and load module directory user fields.  Good luck.
