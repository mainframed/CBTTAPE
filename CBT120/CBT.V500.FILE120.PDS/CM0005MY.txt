ACCUMULATING ASSEMBLER TECHNIQUES

      Newer MVS systems programmers are amazed at how much the
"old-timers" know about the MVS operating system.  It is manifestly true
that the MVS (aka OS/390) operating system has a tremendous number of
software parts and components which work together.  And to a new person,
the older practitioners seem to be thoroughly knowledgeable in them,
while most newer MVS people (there are a few exceptions) scratch their
heads in amazement, and wonder how.

      Today, I'd like to show the true reasons why the old-timers know
so much about the "current" MVS systems.  I would have "logically"
surmised that the opposite should be the case, but that's not so at all.
Old-timers have newer systems programmers (generally speaking) solidly
beaten, when it comes to thorough "insider" knowledge of MVS internals.

      The main reason is that much of MVS is old code--25 or more years
old.  The second reason is that the OS/360 systems, through MVT, VS2,
MVS/370, MVS/XA, and MVS/ESA have always been upwardly compatible.  Most
of the old programs will still run on the newer MVS systems.  Therefore,
MVS knowledge that has been built over time, usually does not become
obsolete.  The old facts continue to be true, for the most part.  So as
the systems get newer, the only things the older people have to learn,
are the exceptions and the new features.  The rest of their knowledge
remains solidly intact, and it's just as true as it was 30 years ago.

      Newer people wonder if there's a way to catch up.  I think there
is, but it takes a lot of work, and a plan.  Today, I'm here to provide
the plan.  You and I both, will have to do the work.


THE ASSEMBLER BASIS FOR MVS KNOWLEDGE

      No matter what anybody says, the MVS operating system is written
in Assembler Language.  Of course, there's IBM's internal PL/1-like
language, whether they call it PL/S, PL/AS, PL/X, or whatever.  But
everyone will admit that these languages were only made to quicken the
development of what is essentially Assembler code.  IBM needed an edge
on its competitors, to be able to develop system-level code faster than
the others could, so that's why they invented these proprietary
languages.  But I'll prove that their purpose was only to develop
Assembler code; the output of these PL/whatever compilers is not an
object deck--it's only Assembler source code!

      Since the Operating System was constructed using Assembler, it
follows that utilities which manipulate Operating System constructs--
control blocks, system data, queues, or whatever--should also best be
made, using Assembler.  So where's the "edge" that old-time MVS system
programmers have?  It's in their Assembler skill, and specifically, in
the fact that they know how to access the MVS components and data
structures in Assembler language programs.

      Today is the "age of OCO".  Source code for the system components
and for utilities which manipulate them, is being hidden away by IBM,
and much more so by the other software vendors.  An up-and-coming
systems programmer today, is handicapped by this trend.  Where can you
learn about system coding, if you can't see any code?

      Well, you can see SOME of the code.  The older programs in the
operating system, which aren't (yet) OCO (Object Code Only), are still
available in the Optional Materials that you can order from IBM.  Also,
IBMlink supports a facility to "view system module" source code, even if
it's OCO, provided that your installation is licensed for that product.
But to a newer programmer, especially with today's emphasis on just
installing products "out of the box", it's daunting to try and break in.
You don't have so much time.  And you just don't know where to start!


THE PLAN.

      I have a plan how to break into learning about MVS system
internals.  Many have followed this plan, and succeeded to an amazing
degree.  In essence, this is really the same plan that the old-timers
followed when they were breaking in--only at that time, it was the
"official" way that systems programmers worked.  Nowadays, it's only
optional, at best.  Today, you need to supply your own ambition.
Under present-day job conditions, this motivation to grow doesn't
usually come from the job itself.

      The idea of the plan is to write, or fix, your own system
utilities, and thereby to accumulate knowledge about how to manipulate
the MVS system parts.  Each utility will access one, or several, MVS
system components, and/or will manipulate some data.  By gathering
experience, first with one utility, then with another, then with
still another, you'll eventually accumulate a great store of knowledge
about many system components.  All of this knowledge will serve you in
good stead, for years to come.  IBM isn't about to ruin all the code
running in all the MVS shops, by changing the system so much, that the
old programs won't work any more.

      Usually, it's easier to start by fixing a utility, than by writing
it from scratch.  In the old days, people would usually write their own
utilities from scratch, and obviously, that gave the better training.
But these days, with less job-induced motivation, and less time for the
project, it's probably better to start by looking at somebody else's
programs.  Fortunately, we have enormous repositories of old utilities
that are freely available for anybody to look at.

      The first source for ready-made utilities that have source code,
is the CBT MVS Utilities Tape web site that is accessible online through
the Internet.  If you want more info on CBT Tape materials, you can
email me.  The CBT Tape web site has its own URL, and is completely
publicly accessible, but if you're a NaSPA member, you can also get to
it from the members only section of the NaSPA web site:  www.naspa.net .
Besides the CBT Tape web site, there are the older materials from the
Xephon archives (1997 and back) that are available to non-subscribers of
the Xephon journals.  If you want to explore further, you can follow the
links to other MVS-related sites from the CBT Tape web site, NaSPA's web
site, or Eric Loriaux' web site at www.loriaux.com .  The CBT Tape
materials are actually available as a tape, or on cd-rom.  For more
information, email Sam Knutson at sknutson@cbttape.org, or contact the
NaSPA office, or do both.

      Now that we know where to start looking for old utilities, how
do we begin using the materials, and where do we break in?  The answer
is:  look through the CBT Tape contents on File 001 of the CBT Tape,
and pick something that seems interesting to you.  Then go download
the file(s) containing the source code, and start looking at it.  Try
the program, and see how it works externally.  Then look at the code,
and try and see how it does it's "magic".  Gradually, the workings of
the system components, as they are accessed, will unfold to you--one
component at a time.

      Let's start with an example.  Consider the COPYMODS program from
File 229 of the CBT Tape.  COPYMODS is a utility which allows you to
make from one to ten duplicate copies of all files in a magnetic tape,
including the labels.  Obviously, in order to do this, the COPYMODS
program requires that you have "BLP privilege" for your userid, in both
the JES class and in the security system, because the program ignores
all the label information in the output tape(s), and most of the label
information in the input tape.  The COPYMODS program requires the
ddname IN for the input tape, and OUT1, OUT2, ... thru OUT10 optionally,
for up to 10 output tapes.  See Figure 1 for sample COPYMODS JCL.

      Why are we mentioning COPYMODS here?  Because we want to learn
some system internals information from the way COPYMODS works.  And
it'll be the same idea, from any other utility program you study.

      The COPYMODS program has to find out which ddnames you've coded in
your JCL, in order to figure out which output files to open.  You may
want to make only one output tape, in which case you'd only code one
output DD card, perhaps OUT1, or it could be OUT4 or OUT7.  Or possibly
you might want to make four tape copies, as illustrated in the sample
JCL of Figure 1.  Then you'd code four output ddnames, perhaps OUT1 thru
OUT4.  When the COPYMODS program starts executing, it has to determine
which ddnames that look like OUT1 thru OUT10, are present in your JCL.
Once you see how COPYMODS does this, you'll learn about the TIOT control
block, and how to access ddnames in an Assembler program.  This will be
a piece of knowledge that you'll store up for the future.

      Look at the code snippets in Figure 2.  You see how to access
the beginning of the TIOT (Task IO Table) control block from the CVT
(Communication Vector Table) that is the starting point for getting
to most MVS system information.  The beginning of the CVT is pointed
to at virtual storage location X'10', or decimal 16.  This was true
at the beginning of OS/360, with real storage location X'10', and it'll
probably always be true, as long as this operating system exists.  Once
you've got the TIOT and point to the first ddname, you can start
checking for the presence of the ddnames you're looking for.  If, in
the future, you ever have to check for the presence of a ddname in a
program, you'll always know how to do it.


BUILDING FOR FUTURE KNOWLEDGE

      Now that you've seen a piece of this process, you can go about
starting to accumulate knowledge for yourself.  Pick a utility you like,
and study its parts.  Try and change the program a bit, using some of
the other things you've already learned.  Test the changed program out,
to see if you've actually accomplished the result that you'd wanted to
achieve.  As you build success upon success, your knowledge will grow
accordingly.  And over the years, your own knowledge can build, even to
the point of equalling that of the old-time experts.  It all depends on
your ambition.  Good luck.  I hope to see you again next month.

Figure 1.   Sample JCL to run the COPYMODS program from File 229
            of the CBT MVS Utilities Tape.

            DD for the input tape is IN.  DD for one to ten output
            tapes is OUTn, where n can be any number from 1 to 10.

            The COPYMODS program has to find out which output DD
            names are present.  For this purpose, it must search
            the TIOT (Task IO Table) control block, and make a
            determination which output files to open.

            Note that the output VOLSER's are dummy names.  MVS JCL
            requires that they be different from the input VOLSER.
            But the output tapes will contain exactly the same data
            as the input tape, including the labels, if any.

           ddnames from OUT1 to OUT10 are present in the JCL.

           DD names from the JCL, go into the TIOT (Task IO Table)
           control block, which is accessible from the CVT
           (Communication Vector Table) using the following code:

           This code hasn't gone "out of style" in 25 years,
           and it still works perfectly.  This shows you how
           to access ddname information in an Assembler program.
