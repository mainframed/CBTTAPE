THE "REVIEW" COMMAND REVISITED

      Several weeks ago, our operations manager Roman Panczyszyn asked
me to install the QUEUE program, which is a "free" JES2 spool browser.
When I asked him why he specifically wanted QUEUE, even though we also
own SDSF, he replied that QUEUE has a "find all" command (called FALL)
that only displays "found" lines without showing the others.  When
you're searching for the history of one specific job while looking
through the whole SYSLOG, this is a useful thing to have.

      After I installed QUEUE for him, he asked me another thing.
That's fine for the current SYSLOG, but what about our old SYSLOGs
that are archived on datasets and on tape.  Can't I have a facility to
just display "found" lines for them too?  I thought for a moment, and
asked: "How do I look at old SYSLOGs on disk and on tape?  I use the
REVIEW command, a generalized file browsing program that is ideally
suited for the task.  REVIEW is privately maintained by Greg Price in
Australia.  I wouldn't have to call IBM and try to get them to change
any of their programs.  Let me call Greg and see what he has to say."

      That day, I called Greg in Melbourne.  I asked him to try and
install a "FIND ALL" facility in REVIEW that is akin to the FALL command
in QUEUE.  Greg rang me back a week later, telling me that the coding
was installed in REVIEW and he would be sending me a tape immediately.
In two and a half weeks, the updated REVIEW command was placed on the
CBT MVS Tape (Version 379, File 134) and was ready to be distributed
to the public.  It was also installed at my site, and given to the
operations department.  Roman has expressed his happiness.  As for me,
I'd challenge any software vendor to add a new feature with this kind
of speed.  Incidentally, if you want a new CBT Tape to see all this
software, you can order one from NaSPA.  (Now you can just download
File 134 (REVIEW source) and File 135 (the load modules) from the web
site, www.cbttape.org.)


A REVIEW OF "REVIEW".

      What is this REVIEW program, and why is it special?  REVIEW is
a full-screen TSO command to browse data files.  You might ask, "I
thought we had ISPF BROWSE for that.  Why do we need something else?
Can't we get everything we need from IBM?"  The answer is that REVIEW
doesn't need ISPF services (although it can use them if they're
available).  Also, REVIEW can do a zillion more things than ISPF
BROWSE.  It can often do them a lot faster, especially if you're
looking at big files.

      For example:  REVIEW can format SMF records and LOGREC
records.  It can look at VSAM files and at files with I/O errors.
REVIEW can now even write some of the records it's looking at, to an
output file.  REVIEW handles PDS'es nicely.  It is capable of
"sequentializing" a PDS using all or some of its members, into
IEBUPDTE unload format.  REVIEW can show you tape files as well as
disk files.  You can even look at a DB2 tablespace, row by row.

      Why should we talk about REVIEW now?  I've already written
about it before.  The answer is that REVIEW is evolving, and Greg
Price keeps putting more features into it.  (It is "a terminal case
of creeping featurism", in Greg's words.)  The REVIEW command of
today is not the REVIEW command of yesterday.  There's more to write
about, because there's more that you can use.  For the rest of this
article, we'll mention a few of the lesser known features in REVIEW
and show you how to use them.

      REVIEW comes with good documentation.  Its HELP member, plus
the comments at the beginning of the source code on CBT Tape File
134, and the document on "undocumented" commands, will guide you
through REVIEW's powerful capabilities very completely.


A FEW INTERESTING THINGS FOR STARTERS.

      Let's start with some simple things.  Nowadays, there's a lot of
file transfer going on between the mainframe and other systems.  On
IBM systems, the usual means of representing data is EBCDIC.  On many
other systems, the data representation method is ASCII.  If you look
at an ASCII file on an EBCDIC system it is complete gibberish.  IBM in
its "ultimate foresight" has not provided a way to look at ASCII files
in ISPF/PDF.  However, if you REVIEW an ASCII file on disk or on tape,
look at the initial gibberish, and type the command, ASCII, all of a
sudden, the file has been translated into ASCII and it makes sense.
Type the word ASCII on the command line again, and the representation
toggles back to EBCDIC.  This also works for tape files.

      Speaking about tape files, REVIEW makes them almost as
accessible as disk files.  It helps to have TSO "MOUNT" attribute
turned on for this.  If the "MOUNT" attribute is turned on, and your
TSO session requests allocation of a tape, then the system will prompt
the operator to mount the tape.  Otherwise, the mount request will
usually be blocked.

      A systems programmer is not helpless regarding the TSO MOUNT
attribute.  There is an authorized command on the CBT MVS Utilities
Tape (File 300) called CPSCB (change the PSCB), which can toggle the
MOUNT attribute on and off.  Another command (not authorized) called
LPSCB (list the PSCB) shows you the state of the PSCB (protected
step control block) for your TSO session.  Using LPSCB, you can see if
MOUNT is off or on for your session.  It is my experience that bit
settings in the PSCB will take precedence over RACF settings for
whether "MOUNT" is turned on or off, because RACF just helps to
initialize the PSCB when your TSO session is being started.  However,
while the session is running, the system seems to refer just to the
PSCB, so that altering the PSCB is quite effective in giving you the
control you want.  In most shops, temporarily acquiring the "MOUNT"
attribute should be no problem.  See my thoughts on personally
authorizing your TSO commands, which are in CBT Tape Files 185 and
186.

      Once "MOUNT" is turned on, if you REVIEW a cataloged file that
is 'File 1' on a standard-labeled tape, then your console operator will
immediately get a mount message for that particular volume.  When the
tape is mounted, REVIEW proceeds to show you the file, almost the
same as if it were a disk file.  To REVIEW a non-cataloged file on
a standard-labeled tape, you use the VOL parameter, as for a
non-cataloged disk file.  To REVIEW a file which is not 'File 1',
please refer to the REVTAPE clist, which is printed in Figure 1.


COPYING PARTS OF A FILE.

      Two new commands were recently added to REVIEW, to relieve some
of the frustration that accompanies the use of any browsing program.
The problem is that you can see, but you can't touch.  The two new
commands, CUT and ADD, allow you to touch what you're browsing as well
as just to look at it.  CUT copies a certain number of lines, via QSAM,
to the REVIEW output dataset.  ADD does the same as CUT, except that
the copied lines are appended to the end of the output dataset.  These
two commands allow for a considerable amount of flexibility.  The
copied lines begin from the top of the screen you're positioned to.

      As currently implemented in REVIEW, any output file that REVIEW
sends data to, has to have the ddname of SYSUT2.  You can use the
"TSO" subcommand of REVIEW while REVIEWing any dataset, to invoke this
allocation.  For example, you can say:  TSO ALLOC FI(SYSUT2)
DA(OUTP.SEQ.FILE)) SH REUSE while you're REVIEWING a large dataset.
Then you position to the place where you want to start copying lines.
To copy 836 lines starting from the current place, just type: "CUT
836" on the command line, and REVIEW will copy that number of lines.
If you want to start at a different place in your file, and you want
to add 87 more lines to the output dataset, just position yourself
there, and type: "ADD 87".  Thus, you have "touch and feel" access to
the data you're looking at.  This works for VSAM browsing also.  Just
don't give the output dataset SYSUT2 any DCB attributes when you're
allocating it as NEW under TSO.  Let REVIEW supply the DCB attributes
if you're looking at a VSAM file.  REVIEW will give the output dataset
RECFM(U) when you're copying VSAM records.


LOOKING AT DISK AND TAPE LOCATIONS.

      REVIEW lets you go directly to a relative TTR disk location, or
to a relative block tape location.  When REVIEWing a dataset, simply
enter the command:  NEWTOP ttr-value.  The ttr-value is usually a 5 or
6-digit number.  If you're looking at a tape file, the number will be
the relative block of the tape file you're looking at.

      NEWTOP pretends that the top-of-data is the relative TTR or
block address you've specified.  For example, "NEWTOP 00001" points to
the real top-of-data for a sequential file.  "NEWTOP 00101" points to
the first record in the second relative track of the file.  "NEWTOP
00302" points to the second record in the fourth relative track of the
file.  If you go to the bottom of a file or pds member you're
REVIEWing, REVIEW will display the end-of-file TTR, so you can get
some orientation as to what values to use.  The abundant REVIEW
documentation will help you very much.

      How can NEWTOP help you recover a file that has I/O errors when
you try to access it?  You may not be able to recover all of the
file, but you'll probably recover most of it.  Suppose for simplicity
that the bad file is physical sequential.  Allocate SYSUT2 to a new
file with the same DCB attributes.  Then REVIEW the file from the
top.  Do a FIND on some non-existent string, to force REVIEW to look
at every record of the file.  When the I/O error hits, go to the
preceding TTR and note its last line number.  Go back to the top and
enter the CUT command with the proper number of lines to copy.  Then
step through successive TTR locations.  Keep entering "NEWTOP ttr"
for the next TTR, until you get real data again.  Repeat this
process for the later data, except that you use the ADD command to
append the new data, instead of the CUT command.  In this way, you'll
recover all of the good data in the file.


IN SUM.

      There's very much more practical everyday utility to be found in
the REVIEW command.  Look at its HELP member and the other descriptions
to be found on the CBT Tape File 134.  REVIEW can assist you in many
ways you've never previously dreamed of.  Spend some time with REVIEW,
and I assure you that REVIEW will repay your time, with interest.

      Good luck.  We're monthly again.  See you next month.
