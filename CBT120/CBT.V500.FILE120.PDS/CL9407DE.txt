YOUR TSO SESSION - USING THE TSO SESSION MANAGER

      Nowadays, we're often surprised that "ancient" software can be
just as useful today as it once was.  We have many examples of this.
A few months ago (in the July 1994 issue) I wrote about the IEHMOVE
program and how it can be useful in these times, to prepare mainframe
sequential files and PDS'es for download to PC disks.  Another example
concerns the use of a CLIST to invoke batch SMP/E under TSO, which I
wrote about some time ago (October 1992).  This kind of CLIST had been
common during SMP4 days, when there was no ISPF interface for SMP.
Now that there is an ISPF interface, the SMP CLIST is still just as
useful as it was in times past.

      Our example for today is the ancient TSO Session Manager, now a
part of TSO/E.  The Session Manager carries an initial copyright date
of 1977, which indicates how old it is.  The Session Manager was
designed to overcome a serious problem with TSO.  TSO, in its native
mode, can only show one screen of output at a time.  After the output
leaves the screen, you can't get it back again.  In other words, you
can't scroll backwards or forwards, and you can't save the data.  That
can be very inconvenient sometimes.

      The Session Manager's main function is to preserve your TSO
commands beyond one screen's worth of output.  Further, you can scroll
back many lines to an old command, and re-enter it by typing over part
of it.  An entire record of your TSO session can be printed out or
copied to a dataset.  This is a big improvement.  There is also a
"string find" capability.  These features make the Session Manager far
more useful, in most situations, than the normal TSO viewing mode.

      How do you invoke the Session Manager?  All you have to do is to
change the program that is executed by your TSO Logon Procedure.  Just
change the program name from IKJEFT01 to ADFMDF03, and you'll get the
Session Manager.  It's that simple.  Actually, there are some finer
points (see Figure 1).  Anybody with TSO/E can use the Session
Manager.  Even shops without TSO/E probably can get to it also.


HOW DOES THE SESSION MANAGER WORK?

      When you invoke the Session Manager main task, ADFMDF03, two
parallel subtasks are then attached:  the original TMP (IKJEFT01),
and the Session Manager subtask.  Terminal I/O that is normally
handled by the TMP (TGET's and TPUT's) gets automatically intercepted
and re-directed into one or more of the Session Manager data areas
known as "streams".  Meanwhile, the Session Manager has physically
divided your terminal display into separate areas known as "windows".
Data from the various "streams" is selectively (and intelligently)
mapped to the various "windows" for the user to view.  See Figure
2 for an approximation of a default Session Manager screen.

      The Session Manager has input data streams and output data
streams, which are mapped to various windows on your terminal display.
Usually (in the default screen setup), the input stream corresponding
to TSO input, is mapped to a window at the bottom of your display
tube.  TSO commands typed into this area are sent to the input stream
known as the TSOIN stream, from where they are directed to the TSO
terminal monitor subtask and executed.

      At the top of the default display, there is a large window which
receives output from the TSO commands.  This "Main Window" displays
data from the TSOOUT stream, which has received all the TPUT output
that the Session Manager intercepted from TSO.  Since the TSOOUT
stream is a large data area (whose size is controllable by the
installation and the user), many lines of output can be stored and
viewed.  In addition, all the TSO input from the TSOIN stream gets
copied to the TSOOUT stream and is displayable there.  The TSOOUT
stream therefore becomes an effective log of everything done by the
TSO session.

      Of course, there are limits to the amounts of data which can be
stored in a Session Manager stream.  When a stream becomes full, it
wraps around to the beginning.  This is true for all of the various
kinds of streams that have been initialized for your session.  Some
of the other streams are:  SMIN (which holds Session Manager input
commands), SMOUT (which contains the results from Session Manager
commands), and MESSAGE (which contains the message outputs).  The
message outputs are usually also copied into the TSOOUT stream.


NAVIGATING THE TSOOUT STREAM.

      The TSOOUT stream is effectively a session log for your session.
As such, you'll often want to look at, or type over, various parts of
the TSOOUT stream data.  In the default Session Manager screen layout,
data from the TSOOUT stream is displayed in the large window, called
the "Main Window", that is located at the top of your video screen
display.  If you look at Figure 2, you'll notice that in the lower
right corner there's a display that says, "MAIN ==> UNLOCKED".  When
the Main Window is in "unlocked mode", every time you press enter,
you'll go down half a screen.  If you press PF12, you'll go to the
bottom of the TSOOUT data and stay in unlocked mode.

      Any other forcible positioning in the TSOOUT data will put the
Main Window into "locked mode".  In locked mode, pressing ENTER will
not reposition the Main Window.  PF7, PF8, PF9, PF10, and PF11 will
forcibly reposition the Main Window in different ways.  Refer again to
Figure 2.  PF7 moves the Main Window up by the Scroll Amount.  PF8
moves the Main Window down by the Scroll Amount.  PF11 moves the Main
Window to the right (it is 255 characters wide), and PF12 moves the
Main Window to the left.  PF9 positions the Main Window to the top of
the TSOOUT data.  PF12 positions the Main Window to the bottom of the
TSOOUT data, and unlocks the Main Window.

      You have capability of finding a string of data in the TSOOUT
stream, so that the Main Window will display the next occurrence of
that string, upwards.  To do a "find", you must enter a case-sensitive
string on the command line at the bottom.  Then press PF5.  The search
will go from the current part of the TSOOUT stream, up toward the top.
PF5 functions repeatedly, so that you may press it over and over again
to find more occurrences farther up in the TSOOUT stream.


FURTHER THOUGHTS.

      Much of the power of the Session Manager lies in the fact
that TSO data can be saved, preserved, and manipulated.  In TSO
native mode, the data goes onto the screen, precious little at a
time.  And once it leaves the screen, it's gone forever.  Not so in
Session Manager mode.  The TSO data may be saved, moved, copied,
and printed.  The IBM program which performs this function is
called SMCOPY.

      SMCOPY is not hard to use.  It is a TSO command which is entered
from Session Manager mode.  There is a lot of flexibility built into
SMCOPY, as is shown by Figure 3, which is part of the SMCOPY HELP
member.  On your system's SYS1.HELP dataset, you can browse the
entire SMCOPY HELP member for further information.

      Next comes the question of switching modes "on the fly".  For
most TSO commands, Session Manager mode improves usability.  However,
there are some commands where you'd rather have TSO in native mode.
For example, commands which repeatedly clear the screen and then
supply a new screen's worth of data after you press ENTER, were
usually designed for native mode operation.  This type of command does
not execute well under the Session Manager.  Under the Session
Manager, you constantly have to press PF12 to go to the bottom and
view the new data.  Also, under Session Manager, when you just want to
press ENTER, you have to enter a blank first.  Repeatedly entering a
blank before pressing ENTER is very tedious if you're constantly doing
so.  Therefore, it would be nice to switch to native mode while using
commands designed for native mode, and then toggle back to your
existing Session Manager environment for the other commands.

      There are (at least) two ways in which this can be done.  First,
IBM provides two different ISRTSO panels in its "ISR" panel library.
The alternate one, ISRTSOA, may be renamed to ISRTSO so it will be used
whenever you are in ISPF Option 6.  This alternate ISRTSO panel has an
option to switch your session into and out of Session Manager mode.
The other way to do it is with a TSO command from CBT Tape File 119
called "SM".  SM is an authorized command which toggles your session
from native mode to Session Manager mode and back.  Both ways work
with limited success.  You'll have to experiment to see which way is
best for your environment.

      Finally, we have to tell you how to go further.  Session Manager
sessions can be altered.  Defaults can be changed.  If you investigate
the Session Manager, there is a lot of power to be taken advantage of.
Therefore, I must mention the manuals.  In the TSO/E User's Guide,
there is a chapter on the Session Manager that used to be in a separate
thin manual called "A Guide to Using the TSO Session Manager".  The
TSO/E Customization manual contains useful information, and if you can
get a copy of "TSO Extensions Version 2 - Session Manager Logic", a
lot of understanding can be acquired from that.

      Anyway, good luck.  It's very stimulating and exciting when
we're constantly trying to expand our horizons.  It also helps us get
our work done faster in the long run.
