THE FASCINATION OF THE DISASSEMBLER - Part Two.

     In Part I (January 1994), we began studying the usefulness of
disassembling machine code.  As you may recall, this is the process
of converting load module CSECTs into assembler source code using
a utility program called a disassembler.

     Two public domain disassemblers can be found on the CBT MVS
Utilities Tape.  The CBT Tape is obtainable through NaSPA.  These
disassemblers are on Files 217 and 171 of the tape.  These two
programs are somewhat similar to each other, but they are also
significantly different.  You can decide which one you like better.

     Let's take a quick look at both of them.  First,
we'll look at their similarities.  Both disassemblers produce very
detailed print output including instruction displacements, a hex
dump of the load module and all the load module attributes.
Additionally, both disassemblers also produce a much plainer punch
output, which is reassembleable.  As for differences, the
disassembler on File 171 allows labels to be fitted from actual
assembly of real macros, whereas the File 217 disassembler has its
own special "label coding" that is required.  As of Version 363
of the CBT Tape, the File 171 disassembler has been improved much.

     The vendor product PDSTOOLS from SERENA International in
Burlingame, Calif., contains both a load module disassembler and an
object deck disassembler (besides the zillion other things it
does).  Reassembleable source code produced by the PDSTOOLS
disassembler has displacement information on each line, making it
a handy tool for fitting zaps into the original load module.  The
PDSTOOLS disassembler does not produce separate print and punch
output.  One output is produced, complete with the displacement
information.  Depending upon a keyword, The PDSTOOLS disassembler
output can be made instantly reassembleable, sandwiched between
appropriate reassembly JCL.  Otherwise, its output is displayed in
a more "diagnostic" format, resembling an assembler listing.

     The PDSTOOLS disassembler also has another feature the other
disassemblers do not:  It can decode entire load modules and it is
not restricted to doing just a CSECT at a time.  I once used the
PDSTOOLS disassembler to disassemble IEANUC01 (for MVS/370 a while
back) and I quickly reassembled it so it actually worked and could
be used for production.  (Note: Don't do this unless you perform
many checks and verifications against the original nucleus to
ensure "sameness.")  You can see that the PDSTOOLS disassembler is
very powerful and quick to use.

     In Part I, we discussed a few applications of disassembling
load modules.  In this month's column, we'll go into more detail.
Right now, I'll summarize some useful techniques involving
disassembly we discussed previously.

First problem: How do we determine if two different load modules
actually have the same code?

Answer: Disassemble them both with the same disassembler and compare
the two source decks line by line with a compare utility.  If the
decks are the same, the code is the same.  Only the load module
attributes and the CSECT structure (the load module maps) will then
need to be compared.  This will prove "sameness" of the modules, even
if the link-edit dates are different.

Next situation:  Suppose we have two load modules, one zapped and
the other not.  How do we determine where the zap is?

Answer: Simply disassemble both of them and again compare the
source decks line by line.  The location of the zap(s) will appear
immediately upon comparison.

     Finally, suppose we have to upgrade a USERMOD zap from a lower
maintenance level of (non-OCO) IBM code to a more recent level of the
same module.  Disassembling both modules will usually reveal the
appropriate location of the corresponding zap in the higher
maintenance level code.  The technique may even work if some of the
actual assembler instructions which are to be zapped became different
instructions in the later level of the module.  For example, suppose
the newer module was created by IBM using a different PL/S compiler
than the old one.  It is possible that the same PL/S logic may
translate into completely different assembler code.  Nevertheless,
you can sometimes find the appropriate zapping point with the aid of
disassembled source code because you understand the overall logic
better when you see the assembler instructions before you.


Trying To Learn How Code Works

     Usually, when you disassemble a load module, you have far less
information about how it works than if you had a commented source
deck.  With disassembled source, you have the instructions but must
do considerable detective work to learn the logic.  It pays to use
whatever extra clues you can find.  However, let's start with the
basics.

     Learning the details of how a program works from a
disassembled source deck usually takes a lot of patience.  However,
a quick glance at a disassembled source deck will reveal some
significant information.  For instance, you can usually spot patch
areas quickly.  DCB control blocks are easily recognizable
once you've seen them.  It is usually possible to see the DDNAME in
the DCB.  You can tell if it's hard coded in the DCB or if a
substitute DDNAME is being dropped in.  SVC instructions are
decoded by all these disassemblers.  You can get a general idea what
the program is doing by looking at which SVC instructions have been
coded.

     One of the more subtle details you can get from a disassembled
module is the structure of a work area or a control block created
by that module.  You may notice a section of code that has a series
of STore instructions to different displacements off the same
register, with other instructions including a Load or Load Address
instruction, placed before each STore.  This may indicate that the
program is obtaining information and placing it in the various
pigeon holes of a work area or control block.  With some patience,
you can then map the layout of that control block or work area.

     I once used this observation profitably.  I had to refit a zap
to some IBM code which got a new internal work area after a certain
PTF level.  I was worried that the newly added module structure
might interfere with the workings of my zap.  From the cover letter
of the PTF I got some idea of the new work area's purpose.  I didn't
have source at the higher PTF level because the microfiche
(remember microfiche?) for that PUT level wasn't obtainable yet.

     Our PTF had been an advance shipment obtained from a CBPDO.
Nevertheless, with disassembled source I was able to figure out what
kind of data went into that work area and at which point in the code
execution it happened.  It turned out that my zap code could safely
use the new work area before the IBM code used it.  The zap
code "did its thing" before the IBM code initialized that new piece
of storage for the first time.  So I successfully fitted and tested
my zap.

     Deciphering uncommented disassembled code is much easier if
you have clues.  Often, a lower level of the same module can be
found in base level machine readable source (the Optional Materials
tapes) or on microfiche.  Even though some of the code will change
at the higher maintenance or release levels much of that module's
structure and logic will also be found at the lower level.
Additionally, you have commented assembler source at the lower
level.  Exploit this hint as much as possible.  It really pays to
save your old Optional Materials tapes.

     I have a scheme to get at these source materials quickly,
which you can see on Files 188 and 189 of the CBT Utilities Tape.
Unfortunately, I do not have the space to describe its details
here.  Once I have my scheme in place, I can find and assemble any
source module in five minutes.  Why is this so good?  Because IBM
source code is heavily commented.  Even at base level code,
these materials will aid immeasurably in trying to negotiate a
disassembly deck of the code you are actually running.  Together with
care, patience and intelligence, these hints will definitely assist
you in this work.


Disassembling Object Decks

     The public disassembler programs we've mentioned take load
modules as input, as opposed to object decks.  Object decks are
RECFM=FB card-image decks that are output from the assembler and
from language compilers.  Load modules are RECFM=U and are output
from the linkage editor, or now, from the binder.  Even though
object decks are not directly executable on the computer, they do
contain machine instructions identical to those in load modules.  As
such they could be candidates for disassembling.  However, with the
free disassemblers from the CBT Tape Files 217 and 171 the object
decks will have to be link-edited into load modules first, before
their code can be disassembled by these programs.

     A shortcut to this process would be a disassembler program
that could take object decks as input instead of load modules.  As
of this writing, I don't know of any free program that does this.
However, the PDSTOOLS vendor product, besides its DISASM subcommand
to disassemble load modules, has a READOBJ subcommand to
disassemble object decks directly without having to link-edit them
first.

     For example, you can point the READOBJ subcommand directly at
a PTF and obtain instant disassemblies of all the object decks in
the PTF.  Whatever tools you have, disassembling an object deck
directly from the PTF can pay big dividends.  Since all the
disassemblers generate instruction displacements within some of
their outputs, it is possible to fit a zap directly onto the PTF
without having to APPLY it first.  It doesn't even have to be on your
system and you can already figure out the proper hooks into it.  You
don't have to wait until the full-sized load module is actually
sitting on a system library.

     I'll show you a startling example of something I was able to
accomplish with PDSTOOLS.  But the same kind of thing can be done,
albeit much more awkwardly, with public tools.  My friend, Merv Hemp,
recently asked me to refit an old modification to module IDCLC01,
which performs LISTC processing and displays catalog entries.  A
1-byte zap to this module could greatly shorten the "LISTC LEVEL"
output by eliminating the repetition of the catalog name after
displaying every catalog entry (See Figure 1).  With the zap on, the
LISTC display is much shorter and runs much quicker than with the
zap off.  I mentioned this case in passing, last time.

     This zap had been fitted at DFP Version 2.4 base level.  Merv
wanted me to fit the same zap to a DFP Version 3.3.1 level of
IDCLC01 at PTF level UY83416.  I actually later fitted this zap to
17 different maintenance levels of IDCLC01, doing the whole job
with PDSTOOLS in less than two hours.  A full machine-readable
exhibition of this work can be found on a new CBT Tape, File 236.

     How did I go about this?  First, I had to find every IBM SMPPTS
data set in my data center complex.  In PDSTOOLS, I did a global
LISTFILE command against all of our 400 mounted volumes, looking for
all data sets containing the string "PTS" within their names.  When I
found these, I narrowed the list down (by eyeball) to just the SMPPTS
data sets for IBM modules.  There were six of them, which referred to
five different levels of the MVS operating system.  As you know,
these PTS data sets contain the actual text of IBM PTF fixes.

     Next, I scanned each PTS data set for the string, "IDCLC01",
getting a small list of members in each PTS.  The PDSTOOLS command
which does this is:  "FIND : /IDCLC01/ THEN(MEMLIST)," which says:
Find every member containing the string "IDCLC01" and display a
member list consisting of only those members.  Once I had this list
in each PTS data set, I ran the READOBJ command against every PTF to
disassemble all the object decks in it (and use the ISPF EDIF service
to display the result).  Going up and down each disassembly of an
IDCLC01 module, I found the proper place to fit the zap for that
level.

     Fitting this zap to the 17 different levels of IDCLC01 I found
at our data center, took two hours with PDSTOOLS.  The same job
would have taken perhaps 10 to 25 hours without PDSTOOLS, but it
could have been done using public materials too.  Here's how.  After
finding which PTFs contained the string "IDCLC01," you could edit a
copy of that PTF to extract its object deck for IDCLC01.  Then you
would link-edit that object deck and run it through one of the
disassembler programs.  At this point, the zap could be fitted by
looking through the disassembler print output.


Conclusion

     I hope this month's column opens your mind in a new direction.
Disassembling should no longer be a "dirty word" or label you as
"dangerous."  On the contrary, it is just another essential
technique for a systems programmer to use in solving many of the
problems that come up at most shops.  Good luck.

Figure 2.   Illustration of how the Assembler Instructions in an
            IBM module can change when different releases of PL/S
            are used, or when the PL/S logic may have changed
            slightly.  The top set of instructions comes from the
            DFP Release 2.4 machine-readable source at base level.
            The bottom set of instructions is from a PDSTOOLS
            object module disassembly obtained from PTF UY83416
            itself, using the PDSTOOLS "READOBJ" subcommand.
            Included here are instructions on how to fit this zap,
            in general.


     The zap is fitted on various levels of the module IDCLC01, which
belongs to load module IDCLC01.  In XA DFP 2.4 base level, the mod is
done to the first branch of nine similar compares and branches that
occur one after the other as follows:
                          (This is from a source code assembly.)

         C     @02,FDTPTR+80(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01262           <-----   (Zap 4770 to 4700 here)
         C     @02,FDTPTR+8(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01262
         C     @02,FDTPTR+96(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01262
         C     @02,FDTPTR+100(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01262
         C     @02,FDTPTR+104(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01262
         C     @02,FDTPTR+92(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01262
         C     @02,FDTPTR+56(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01262
         C     @02,FDTPTR+64(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01262
         C     @02,FDTPTR+60(,@15)
         BNE   @RF01263

      Because of changes in the PL/AS compiler (whichever one is being
used now--it doesn't matter to us) this logic is done differently in
MVS/ESA 4:

The idea is that you have to find a similar pattern of nine sets of
instructions in module IDCLC01 and zap the branch of the first set
to a noop (4770 to 4700).

                    (This is from READOBJ output of PDSTOOLS.)
