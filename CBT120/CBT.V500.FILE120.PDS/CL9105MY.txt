MEMBER GROUP SELECTION IN PARTITIONED DATASETS.

      It's well known that I'm a big fan of the "PDS" program product
that's on File 182 of the CBT MVS Public Tape. (The CBT tape can be
ordered through NaSPA).  I use "PDS" (or its vendor-supported
successor called "PDS/E Sysprog Utilities") 95 percent of the time in
my work.  Some people (who evidently haven't exploited these products)
had suggested that I've "overemphasized PDS" in my writings.  Well,
the fact is that I haven't written about "PDS" here for close to a
year, in deference to those people.  But any product that has 1000
separate utility functions (more in the case of PDS/E), and integrates
the functioning of your ISPF sessions, deserves more press and not
less, in my opinion.

      This month, I'll show you one of the most powerful tools you can
use to manipulate partitioned datasets and their members.  It happens
to be a little-known part of both "PDS" products.

      Since the free "PDS" product and the vendor-supported "PDS/E"
product have much of this material in common, we'll often refer to
both products collectively as PDS(/E).

      We'll start off discussing an annoying problem that surfaced at
my last shop.  The situation is typical of an exposure which can
happen in all production environments.  Similar things also cropped up
years ago, when I was a DOS applications programmer.  There is
something here for everyone to learn about.  What's not so obvious, is
that you can do an action to SOLVE such a problem conclusively in very
short order.

      Our company had a "bad subroutine" linked into dozens of
production load modules.  We'll call the routine TIMDATE for the
discussion here (the real routine is proprietary).  There were so many
occurrences of this routine buried in our production libraries that we
thought it impossible to root them out immediately.  But until they
were all replaced with good versions in all load modules, we'd be in
constant danger of middle-of-the-night phone calls, and of production
CICS regions crashing "at random" in the middle of the day.

      This situation actually happened last January 1st.  TIMDATE,
this in-house "time-date routine", was coded to take a user abend when
the year was incorrect.  The TIMDATE module was a part of some CICS
transactions and was also a part of many batch load modules.  In a
CICS transaction, its user abend would crash the entire CICS region,
because CICS operates under one TCB.  In a batch job, its user abend
would force a night call from operations to the duty programmer, who'd
have to re-linkedit the offending load module.  That was a rather
unpleasant occurrence for all involved, since very often, the duty
programmer did not have a "dial-up" at home.  To re-linkedit the
module, that programmer would have to drive to work in the wee hours
of the morning.

      Using two features of the "PDS" product, I cured the entire
problem in two hours flat, before any lasting damage could be done
to corporate production.

      This technique is little-known, even among many seasoned systems
people.  I myself didn't know about that particular feature of "PDS(/E)"
before we had the problem.  Hence I was moved to write something about
it, to help everybody benefit in the future.


HOW TO CURE THE CASE OF A "BAD" SUBROUTINE.

      My "magic tools" to cure the problem of the bad subroutine were:
the under-utilized "IF" subcommand of the "PDS" program product, and
the little-known "RELINK" operand of the PDS "MAP" subcommand.

      Let's look at "IF" first.  I think that a great part of IF's
lack of exploitation is caused by the fact that it's hard to figure
out what a command called "IF" is supposed to do.  "If" is a rather
nondescript word in the English language.  As a command, the word "if"
is completely meaningless.  "If" does suggest something that's
conditional.  But what?  What would a vague conditional command in a
product that manipulates datasets be useful for?

      I'll tell you what "IF" really does.  The IF subcommand of PDS
actually grabs members of a library according to some criterion, so
they can belong to a "member group".  Any subsequent "PDS" utility
operation could be made to operate on ALL the members in that group,
and on no other members of the library.  People just aren't used to
having a utility that will CONDITIONALLY form groups of pds members
which you want to manipulate together.  Other products don't generally
do that sort of thing.  That's why I think this powerful "IF" facility
is not widely understood.

      This "IF" feature of PDS(/E) is what saved our skins.  "IF" can
pick out members of a library according to more than fifty separate
selection conditions.  Here's how IF works. You start with a large
member group, perhaps ALL MEMBERS (denoted by the colon ":")  Then
you use one of the fifty-odd criteria to cut the size of the group
down, allowing in the new group, only those members of the starting
group that fit the condition specified.

      What criteria can you choose from?  See Figure One for a list of
what's available in the "PDS" products.  One of these criteria is
called MODULE (modname).  When applied to a library of load modules,
MODULE (modname) will pick load module members according to whether
the csect called "modname" was linkedited into that load module.

      Voila.  We have what we need.  With this command, we can quickly
locate all load modules in our production load libraries (and only
those modules), that contain the subroutine called TIMDATE.  We just
have to point the "PDS" program to our load library, enter the command:
"IF : MODULE(TIMDATE) THEN (SUBLIST)" to ask for a correct list of
members, and let the computer crank away.  When the computer's done,
we have our member list.

      Finding the bad load modules is two-thirds of the problem.  The
rest?  How do we fix the problem for each load module we've found?

      That's where the RELINK operand in the "MAP" subcommand of PDS
enters.  Given a load module or a group of load modules, the MAP
command with the RELINK keyword will generate complete JCL and linkage
editor control statements to correctly re-linkedit the load module.
See Figure Two.  Doing that for one load module is an amazing feat.
But with PDS(/E), a product that supports operations on groups of
members, this "linkedit JCL generation" can be done for all load
modules in the group using one command.

      Fact.  In the "PDS" product, we do an operation to a group of
members by substituting an asterisk "*" instead of the member name, in
any PDS subcommand.  For example, suppose we've adjusted our load
library member group with "IF : MODULE(TIMDATE)", to contain only load
modules having the csect called TIMDATE linkedited in them.  Then we
can generate complete re-linkedit JCL for all of these modules at
once.  We simply issue the one command:  "MAP * RELINK".  Again, see
Figure Two, which shows a result of these actions.

      The JCL and linkage editor control statements generated by
"MAP * RELINK" can be put out to a dataset and then edited.  We can
save these generated control statements by issuing the command,
"CONTROL DSN(dataset.name)", where "dataset.name" is the name of an
available dataset which will be written to.  After the "CONTROL DSN"
command has been issued, all PDS commands and outputs are written out
to that dataset as a file.  To close the file, the "CONTROL NODSN"
command must be issued, and the output file will be closed by the PDS
program.

      A quick editing job on the dataset, will create a job to replace
the bad subroutine with a good one of the same name.  Slap a job card
on top of the stream, and submit the linkedit job.  This will
completely cure our dangerous situation.  See Figure Three.

      So, to solve the case of the bad subroutine, the necessary
sequence of PDS(/E) commands reads as follows.

   PDS  load.library
       (points "PDS" to a library)
   IF : MODULE(TIMDATE) THEN(SUBLIST)
       (creates a member subgroup of all modules containing TIMDATE)
   CONTROL DSN(output.dataset.name)
       (opens an output dataset to be written to)
   MAP * RELINK
       (generates re-linkedit JCL and writes it to the output dataset)
   CONTROL NODSN
       (closes the output dataset)

      The dataset 'output.dataset.name' is then edited to create a
working linkedit job.  After manually inserting some linkedit INCLUDE
statements to replace module TIMDATE with a "good" version, and after
changing SYSLMOD to point to a new output load library, the job is
ready to run.  When the job has finished, that library has been
completely "cured" from containing the bad subroutine.  We repeat this
procedure for all load libraries suspected of containing load modules
with the bad subroutine, and our problem is solved.


SOME OTHER USES OF THE "IF" SUBCOMMAND OF "PDS(/E)"

      Figure One, which lists criteria by which the "IF" subcommand
chooses members, is worth study.  Space has unfortunately prevented
the inclusion of the rest of this HELP text for "IF", which explains
the significance of each criterion in detail.  If you have access to a
CBT Tape, or you have installed PDS or PDS/E, stydy these detailed
explanations in the "PDSHELP" member of File 182, for ideas about this
subcommand's power.  For now, we'll say a few more general things
that'll give you an glimpse.

      "IF" criteria can be broken into several categories.  For source
modules, ISPF stat criteria are major factors.  Picking by userids or
by dates are examples.  To use "IF" to pick members by record count,
ISPF statistics are NOT used.  Actual record counts are.  The ABOVE
and BELOW keywords would do that picking job.

      I find that in a source-type dataset, date-picking is helpful.
I can pick a group of all members I've used in the past two weeks
only.  These will help me look at work that I've done most recently,
without interference from the older members.  You get the idea.  The
process is aided by the fact that the MEMLIST (or "ML") subcommand,
which picks members for inclusion in PDS's ISPF member list, shares
most of the criteria of "member picking" with the "IF" subcommand.  I
get into a PDS "ISPMODE" session.  I enter, "ML : BIWEEK", and I'm in
business.

      For load modules, there is far more choice.  Every load module
attribute that appears in the partitioned dataset directory can be
used as a criterion.  Also, alias criteria, loadability, and blocksize
(largest block) are criteria that are available when needed.  Even TTR
range within a library is in bounds for picking groups of members.  If
you think about all this, there is an enormous range of system
problems that can be solved, using this facility.

      The "THEN" and "ELSE" keywords, which determine the consequences
of an "IF" member search, should be explained.  One can use "THEN" to
specify a PDS(/E) subcommand which will operate on the member group
produced from the IF member search.  One can use "ELSE" to force that
member group to include only members NOT satisfying the criteria of
the search.  It is recommended to use "SUBLIST" as the resulting
operand of the THEN (or ELSE) keywords most of the time.  That's
because non-default cases of the other subcommands cannot be specified
when they are operands of "THEN".  If "SUBLIST" is used, the result
of the member search is merely a member group consisting of a list of
specific members.  Referring to this list later as the member group,
using asterisk "*", you can afterward let any subcommand operate on
this member group, allowing all options that are available for the
subcommand.

      A concluding example should drive this concept home.  Suppose we
have a library of load modules, some of which have blocks bigger than
the DCB blocksize of the load library, and we want to fix the problem
of the large-block members.  The following sequence of commands will
do the trick.  First, we get into the load library with the command,
"PDS 'our.load.library'".  Then we use "IF" to nail the correct member
subgroup.  We say, "IF : BLOCKERR THEN (SUBLIST)".  This will make a
member group consisting of all members having blocks bigger than the
DCB blocksize.  Then we allocate a new load library that has a
blocksize large enough to accommodate these members.  The PDS "VERIFY
*" command will provide us with an allowable blocksize.  We then say,
"COPY * new.library", which copies all the "large-block" members to
the new library, that has room to accommodate the large blocks.
Then we say "DELETE *" to delete these members from the current
library.  After that, we can compress the library with the PDS
"COMPRESS" subcommand.  COMPRESS preserves the current member group as
a list of member names.  Finally, we can "CHANGE 'new.library'" which
makes the current dataset that PDS is using, the new library.  The
"CHANGE" subcommand does not alter the current PDS member subgroup.
Finally, a command of "COPY * 'old.load.library' will cause PDS to
create an IEBCOPY "COPYMOD" command, to reblock the "big" members, as
they are being copied back to the old load library.  This solves our
problem.

      Note that the "IF" subcommand with the "THEN(SUBLIST)" keyword,
determined the default member group that was used throughout all our
other maneuvers.  The "IF" subcommand, you see, was the heart of the
matter.  "IF" picked the appropriate group of library members for us
to operate on.

      Space is short here.  This subject is far deeper than I have
indicated.  I hope these remarks inspire you to take another look at
some of the power that is buried in the PDS(/E) member selection
subcommands, such as "IF" and "MEMLIST".  A little time so invested,
is guaranteed to yield surprising and pleasing results for you and
your shop.

      Good luck.  See you next month.

             This illustration hints at many of the techniques
             made possible through having so many member choice
             criteria.  Detailed explanations for each criterion
             are part of the actual TSO HELP member as shipped
             from CBT Tape File 182 (member PDSHELP).  Space
             constraints have made it impossible to show all of
             those explanations here.
