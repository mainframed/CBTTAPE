THE "LOOK" TSO COMMAND - AN EYE INTO THE OPERATING SYSTEM:

      This month, I'd like to feature a program that has far more
value than it seems to show initially.  The "LOOK" program allows a
TSO user to display virtual storage in any address space, and to
format any of that space according to the macro DSECT description of
any desired control block.  This amazing result is achieved in a
surprisingly simple manner, and source code is available for all to
examine.

      The "LOOK" TSO command is found on File 264 of the CBT MVS Tape,
which can be obtained through NaSPA in Milwaukee, (414) 423-2420, or
through SPLA at the University of Miami in Florida, (305) 284-6257.

      The "LOOK" command provides a fullscreen display of virtual
storage, or "live machine core", to put it more excitingly.  If it is
run authorized, "LOOK" allows cross-memory examination of most virtual
storage locations for any active address space.  A few special commands
make "control block hopping" very easy, with the actual core contents
visible.  The current version of LOOK is read-only (despite its screen
heading), making it relatively safe to use.

      LOOK can be assembled either for XA and ESA, or for MVS/370
use.  LOOK completely supports 31-bit addressing mode.

      The current version of LOOK is supported by Guy Albertelli of
B.F. Goodrich, near Akron Ohio.  Our current program is a distant
descendant of the "LOOK" program in the old "DCMS" monitor system that
used to reside on the public MVS tapes.

      I'll try to describe the structure and use of "LOOK", and to
show some of its enormous value, in several example scenarios.


BASIC USE OF THE "LOOK" COMMAND.

      Please refer to Figure Two, where a sample LOOK screen is
displayed.  In the input field that states:  "ENTER CMD", the easiest
thing to do is to enter an absolute address.  The initial virtual
address displayed by default upon entry to LOOK is address 00000000.
This of course, is the Prefixed Save Area or PSA.  The most recent
version of LOOK will force a formatted version of the PSA, according
to the macro IHAPSA.  But through the use of the command, "ONULL",
any macro formatting is suppressed.  The virtual locations starting
at 00000000 will then be displayed in Hex, similar to the format of
Figure Two.  If LOOK was assembled for XA, then any number from
00000000 to 7FFFFFFF will yield a displayable result, provided the
virtual storage can actually be paged into real storage.

      Entering an absolute hex address number as input to LOOK, is
equivalent to direct addressing of a virtual storage location.
Entering "+" or "-", followed by a numeric hex value, will place the
display forward, or backward, by the entered amount.  PF7 will move
the display backward to a screen-full of previous storage.  PF8 will
move the screen forward to the next contiguous following storage.

      The second skill in using LOOK is to try indirect addressing
of a virtual storage location.  Indirect addressing can be done in
24-bit mode or in 31-bit mode.  To do indirect addressing in 24-bit
mode, prefix an "I" to an absolute hex address such as "10", or to a
relative address, such as "+58".  The commands would be "I10", or
"I+58".  For 31-bit mode, use a "J" instead of the "I".

      Indirect addressing is like the "LOAD ADDRESS" or "LA" assembler
instruction.  Entering "I10" or "J10" will display the ADDRESS that's
in storage at location "absolute hex 10".  "I+58" or "J+58" will
display the address contained in storage at "hex 58" off the current
location.  Indirect addressing allows for easy control block hopping.

      Of course, the address stored in "absolute location hex 10" is
known to point to the CVT area in an MVS system, or the "Communication
Vector Table".  Both Figures Two and Three point to the beginning of
the CVT.  The CVT is the main control block from where most other
control block pointers ultimately start.

      Note the great differences between Figure Two and Figure Three,
even though they point to the same area of storage.  Figure Two shows
unformatted storage of the CVT area.  Figure Three displays the same
storage, but formatted according to the CVT mapping DSECT, described
by the macro called "CVT" in the AMODGEN macro library.

      The formatted screen illustrated by Figure Three teaches us
about another indirect addressing capability of LOOK.  We can display
further storage by going to the contents of a formatted field that
contains an address.  The letter "L" prefixed to a field name,
allows us to do this.  For example, in Figure Three, suppose we want
to get to the ASCB or Address Space Control Block for the current
address space.  In the CVT, we must go the the TCB pointer field first.
From the formatted screen, we can enter, "LTCBP" which will point us
to location 00000218.  At +8 from this location is the address of the
ASCB, so we can then enter, "J+8", or "I+8", which will point us to
the ASCB.  This is very simple.  If you have access to a working copy
of LOOK, try it.

      PF9 and PF10, "history backward" and "history forward", allow
us to review several previous screens and to step forward again to
where we were.  This facility makes us capable of retracing our
steps in using LOOK.  If you were following the previous exercise on
a screen, press PF9 a couple of times and then PF10 a couple of times.
You'll see how the old screens are brought back again.  Starting from
one of the restored screens, you can proceed forward in a different
direction than before, if you wish.


CHANGING ADDRESS SPACES.

      The LOOK load module should be linkedited with SETCODE AC(1).
LOOK can be run either authorized or non-authorized.  If LOOK is run
non-authorized, it can only display virtual storage in your own TSO
address space.  However, if LOOK is running authorized, it is extremely
simple to display the current virtual storage location in any active
address space.

      Simply type the Hex value of the address space id over the
current ASID value that comes after "DISPLAY ASID= " on the LOOK
screen.  (See Figures Two or Three.)  For example, if you want to
display the current virtual storage location, but in the MASTER
address space, simply type the hex number "0001" over the current
number, "003E", which is the ASID for our TSO address space.  A
cross-memory SRB is dispatched immediately to obtain the storage in
address space 0001, corresponding to the storage location we're
currently displaying.  You see that we can attempt to display ANY
storage location in any address space, and much of the time, we will
be successful.  I don't have to over-emphasize the power that is
implicit in this facility.


USING LOOK TO DIAGNOSE A SYSTEM DUMP.

      When I was a fledgling systems programmer, I was intimidated
by the prospect of solving a system dump.  Once I learned how to use
LOOK, I realized that these dumps can be far simpler to solve than
application program dumps.

      Let me explain.  Problems in an application program are
transient in nature.  The application program is loaded into the
address space's private area of virtual storage, and executes at
"computer speed" there.  If there is a malfunction or a bug, the
storage involved will disappear soon after the abnormal end occurs,
and the address space is cleared out of the system.  That's why you
need a dump, to preserve the contents of private areas (usually) and
some system areas, before the whole scene goes away and you won't be
able to see it again.

      Not so, for a problem occurring in a system area of storage.
System modules are usually loaded into common areas of storage at
IPL time.  They occupy the same virtual storage locations, no matter
what address space they are viewed from.  Even if storage is overlaid,
the "problem evidence" might remain in the system long after the
system problem occurred.  You may therefore use a core-browsing program
such as "LOOK" to return to the problem areas much later, as long as
there wasn't an intervening IPL (and often, even if there was one).

      One can even search the problem areas from one's own TSO
address space (since they are common to all address spaces) to achieve
the diagnosis.  One does not usually need to go into the address space
that was having the problem.

      How can we start?   It is usually best to try and obtain a
good set of registers and a PSW (which contains the instruction to
be executed next).  One of the best places to obtain a good set of
registers and a PSW is in the RTM2 Work Areas of the dump, if they
exist.  Once we have a set of registers, we can use the MAPXA or
MAPSP command, or some similar tool (see this column in the OCTOBER
1990 issue) to check which registers point to addresses in the system
areas, such as CSA, PLPA, MLPA, and SQA.

      One can then use LOOK to browse the vicinity of each of these
register contents (using absolute addressing).  Often, the registers
are pointing to the middle of a system module.  You need only browse
the eyecatcher of the module (or use SMP inquiry) to determine its PTF
level.  Then you can search IBM Link or call the IBM support center to
see if a problem has been reported with that level of the module.
Also, since you have access to all of this storage area, you can
attempt to pinpoint a possible cause of the problem yourself.  Your
previous system knowledge and skill can then be put to good use.

      The main idea is that in a problem with system modules, the
evidence usually remains around for a long time.


USING LOOK TO FOLLOW A CONTROL BLOCK CHAIN ON A REAL SYSTEM.

      The LOOK program is of enormous help to programmers.  When
writing a system utility, or when asking your program to access
system-level information, you'd like to know if the information is
really there.

      Most control block contents in MVS are accessible through a
sequence of address pointers, usually starting from the CVT (or
Communication Vector Table) control block.  For example, if your
program is supposed to read a system date, and your code points to
a certain displacement from the beginning of the CVT, you can get into
LOOK, follow your code instructions, and see if the date is really
there.  This can be done for any simple, or complicated sequence of
instructions that appear in a program.

      Let's say a program wants to find the current system date in
packed decimal.  The system maintains this information at displacement,
X'38' from the beginning of the CVT.  Some assembler instructions to
access the system date would be as follows:

         LA    R5,16             POINT TO CVT
         L     R6,X'38'(,R5)     PUT DATE INTO REGISTER
         ST    R6,PACKDATE       SAVE PACKED DATE
           . . . . . .
PACKDATE DC    F'0'              STORAGE FOR DATE

To verify if the current date is there, get into LOOK.  To point to
the CVT, enter "I10", or (in XA and ESA) "J10".  To suppress the
CVT control block formatting, enter "ONULL".  Then enter "+38" on
the command line.  One can infer from Figure Two that a packed date
indeed occupies this field.

      One might use another set of instructions to access the system
date, this time using the DSECT mapping of the CVT control block.
The instructions would read as follows:

         LA    R5,16             POINT TO CVT
         USING CVT,R5            USE DSECT NAMES
         L     R6,CVTDATE        PUT DATE INTO REGISTER
         ST    R6,PACKDATE       SAVE PACKED DATE
           . . . . . .
PACKDATE DC    F'0'              STORAGE FOR DATE
           . . . . . .
         CVT   DSECT=YES

This time, to verify if the current date is there, get into LOOK.
Point to the CVT by entering "I10" or "J10".  The CVT should be
automatically formatted.  If it isn't formatted, enter the command
"OCVT", which will format the current storage as the CVT control
block.  Then browse the formatted control block display, and look for
the field labelled "DATE".  This is the CVT field called "CVTDATE"
(prefixes are dropped in the fullscreen display).  In Figure Three,
you'll see the "DATE" field in the fifth line of the display.  It
is trivial to verify that the field contains the current date in
packed format.


TAGGING POINTS OF STORAGE, AND RERESHING A DISPLAY.

      It is easy to see that LOOK can be used in far more complicated
storage and control block tracking.  A further help in this regard
is the tagging of storage labels.

      At any current point of storage, one can create a TAG.  Simply
enter an equal sign, followed by a name.  This name will tag the
currently displayed storage.  The tagged storage can be redisplayed
later by entering a comma, followed by the tagged name.

      For example, suppose we have pointed to the system date, at
+38 hexadecimal from the beginning of the CVT.  We can tag this point
in storage by entering the command, "=DATE".  Later, if we'd want to
return to this storage place at any time, we need merely enter the
command, ",DATE".  This will immediately return us to the location
tagged by the command of "=DATE".

      It is necessary to explain one more command, and then I'll send
you on your way.  This is the "R" command, which refreshes storage at
your current location with a new copy from the system.

      If you have displayed storage at one location, and you try and
redisplay the same location, you will not have obtained a new copy of
the system's storage at that location.  Your display will still show
the storage from the first fetch.  The "R" command, entered at this
point, will initiate a new storage fetch from the system at the
current location.  Each time you want to re-access the system's
storage at the current location, you have to enter "R".

      So if you're trying to track changes in storage at a single
location, you have to repeatedly issue "R" commands, to keep getting
new copies of the system's storage from that place.  This is something
that's necessary to know when using LOOK.


CONCLUSION.

      It's not hard to see that LOOK, a simple-to-use TSO command,
provides a powerful tool to see what's running in the system, especially
in the common storage areas.  Many problems that were baffling, will
easily fall, when put under LOOK's scrutiny.  LOOK will help the
programmer also, to verify that the data being programmed for, is
really there.  One can now see virtual storage in any address space,
and navigate through it.

      Good luck searching and LOOKing.  See you next month.

FIGURE ONE.   Online HELP for the LOOK Command.

              LOOK is a TSO command which will display virtual
              storage in the current address space if it is not run
              authorized, or IN ANY ADDRESS SPACE if it is being
              run authorized.  To switch address spaces, merely
              type over the hex address space id field after
              "DISPLAY ASID=" in the screen header.  LOOK is
              currently "read only", and does not change storage.

FIGURE TWO.   The "LOOK" Hex Display.

              This is the normal Hex Display that appears when a
              numeric hex address is entered next to the prompt:
              ENTER CMD- ".  If no control block that is "known to
              LOOK" begins at a current address, then this Hex
              Display of storage is shown.  One may also use
              indirect addressing to point to any memory location.
              For example:  "I10" will point the display to the
              address that is contained in the location X'10'
              bytes virtual.  "I+10" will point to the address
              in location hex 10 bytes OFF the CURRENT virtual
              location.  This figure points to the beginning of
              the CVT on my system.  See Figure Three for the
              formatted version of the same data.  The command
              "ONULL" cancels automatic control block formatting,
              and forces the hex display.  The command "Oblkname"
              forces formatting at the current address, according
              to the DSECT description of the control block "blkname".

FIGURE THREE.   A Formatted Control Block Under LOOK.

              This shows the beginning of the CVT control block
              on an MVS/XA system, as formatted by "LOOK".  LOOK
              uses an actual assembly macro expansion to produce
              this formatted picture.  One can point to any address
              from a formatted control block picture by typing
              "L" followed by the name of any field, with no
              blanks.  For example, to get to the TCB pointer,
              one enters:  "LTCBP".  Control block formatting is
              done automatically by "LOOK" when it recognizes a
              predetermined indicator at an address, indicating
              that it is the location of a certain control block.
              Intentional formatting for an address location to
              the map of a particular control block is done by
              the command letter "O" followed by the name of the
              control block.  For example:  "OCVT" will format
              the current address as the CVT control block.  The
              command "ONULL" will force this formatting off
              unconditionally.
