WRITING YOUR OWN TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR - Part 2

      This month, we'll continue to build on last month's topic, about
how you can write your own TSO command processor.  We mentioned that
nowadays, with the great potential power of REXX execs under TSO, most
people might want to write their handy utilities in REXX.  However,
there is still much cause to write your own TSO command processors, or
even to just understand how they work.

      If you understand how TSO command processors work, you might be
able to easily alter someone else's TSO command processor, so it'll do
what you need.  You might not have to exert the effort of completely
writing your own program.  Where can you find samples of TSO command
processor source code?  The free collection of MVS goodies, including
the CBT MVS Utilities Tape with the CBT Overflow Tape, contains large
numbers of working TSO programs which you can study and change.  You
can download files from the CBT Tape materials, by going to the NaSPA
home page, www.naspa.net, and clicking on "Online CBT Tape".

      As we mentioned last month, a TSO command processor is a program
that was designed to run under TSO.  The load module name, or one of its
aliases, is what you execute.  To execute a TSO command, you type the
load module name and its operands on the command line of an ISPF session
(prefixed by "TSO").  Or under "TSO ready mode", you type the command's
load module name, together with its operands.  A TSO command has
potential access to all system functions, especially if it runs
authorized.  And it runs fast--usually far faster than an equivalent
REXX exec.

      A load module that's designed to run as a command under TSO, is
a bit different from other load modules in one respect.  Upon entry,
Register 1 is expected to point to a TSO control block (created by
your TSO session) called the CPPL, or Command Processor Parameter
List.  The CPPL contains four address pointers:  The first pointer
points to a buffer which contains your command and its operands, known
as the "command buffer", and the other three point to three TSO control
blocks:  the UPT (the User Profile Table), the PSCB (Protected Step
Control Block), and the ECT (Environment Control Table).  The command
buffer contains a four-byte prefix.  The first two bytes contain the
length of the entire command buffer, and the second two bytes contain
the offset from the beginning of the buffer where any operands start, if
there are any.

      Last time, we showed how to use this command buffer prefix
information to parse the operands ourselves.  This time, we'll show you
how to start looking into some of the "official tools" that IBM has
provided.  We'll look into the IBM parsing tool, IKJPARS, in some
detail, and that will indicate the kind of work necessary to set up some
of the other "official IBM tools".  However, IBM manuals tend to
complicate matters unnecessarily, and scare you into thinking you have
to do too much preparation.  And there is also another big "saving
factor", in that once you've set up the IBM facilities in one program,
you can copy them over to any other program, almost without change.  Do
it once, and that's enough!


Let's Get Going with Examples.

      I think that when you study TSO commands, you should have a coding
example, printed out in front of you, to look at.  If you see "how the
other guy did it", it'll be much quicker to learn how to do it yourself.
Start out by looking at Figure 3, which roughly shows the steps that
are required to write a TSO program.  Then start looking for some code
samples to learn from.

      Before talking about coding examples, I'd just like to mention the
simple fact, that using the IBM facilities like IKJPARS and PUTLINE and
IKJDAIR (the TSO dynamic allocation interface) might appear to be
frightening and complicated at first.  But the truth is that once you've
done it once, you can copy almost the same code into all your other
programs.  You can even copy this code from a coding example, straight
into your program.  It helps, however, to have some understanding of
what you're doing, so you don't get caught by some obscure bug.

      A good IBM example that comes with source code, is the PRINTOFF
program that used to be distributed with CBIPOs from IBM.  (I think the
PRINTOFF source code was in IPO1.SAMPLIB.)  PRINTOFF is a TSO command
that will format a dataset for printing at a printer.  If you can't find
a copy of PRINTOFF to study, because (I think) it's no longer
distributed with the OS/390 installation materials, there are several
examples of PRINTOFF source code on the CBT Tape, that have been
modified from IBM's distributed version.  One example of PRINTOFF source
is on CBT Tape File 300, and a better example is on File 325.

      PRINTOFF, although it uses most of the IBM-supplied TSO functions,
is a bit complicated for a beginner, so I'd suggest a program like LPSCB
(List the PSCB) from CBT Tape File 300 to start studying.  LPSCB only
uses the IBM Parser (IKJPARS) and the IBM Putline Service (IKJPUTL or
its CVT pointer), so it's simpler than PRINTOFF, which also uses IBM's
allocation service and error code handling.  PRINTOFF also has a far
more complicated operand structure than LPSCB, so we'll look at LPSCB as
our introductory example.  However, if you don't like either PRINTOFF or
LPSCB, or if you're having trouble understanding them, there are several
hundred other TSO programs to look at, on CBT Tape File 300 alone.

      What does LPSCB do?  LPSCB is a TSO command which displays the
contents of the three "other CPPL control blocks":  the PSCB (its
default), and optionally, the UPT, and the ECT.  If you invoke the LPSCB
command (as I've modified it) with the operand ALL, you get a formatted
display of all these three control blocks for your own TSO session.  If
you code the optional keyword ECT, you get the PSCB and ECT only.  If
you code the keyword UPT, you get the PSCB and UPT only.

      Please look at Figure 1, to see the macros you have to code, to
tell the TSO Parser program, IKJPARS, the structure of permissible
operands for LPSCB.  These are only keyword parameters.  LPSCB has no
positional parameters.  Now look at Figure 2, which shows the macros
that were coded to show the permissible operands for the PRINTOFF
command.  See how much more complicated the PRINTOFF operands are, than
the LPSCB operands?

      The key to using the IBM Parser, IKJPARS, is to decide
beforehand, what all the possible operands for your command processor
program will be.  Then, you can figure out how to code all the macros
between the IKJPARM macro and the IKJENDP macro, so you can easily
parse for the operands that your command will need.  Before calling
the IKJPARS routine, your program will have to perform some routine
setup, which is similar for all TSO commands that use the IKJPARS
service.  Most TSO programs that use IKJPARS, perform this setup
procedure near the beginning, because one of the first things they have
to do, is to examine what operands were coded in the command
invocation, and act accordingly.  Therefore, they set up for IKJPARS,
and then invoke it with a LINK or CALLTSSR macro, not far from the
program's entry point.  After return from IKJPARS, the program examines
which operand fields were coded, and goes on intelligently with the
rest of its processing.

      To set up for using IKJPARS, you have to create an 8-fullword
area, and fill at least 7 fullwords of it.  This is called the PPL,
or Parse Parameter List.  The Parse Parameter List is mapped by the
IKJPPL macro in SYS1.MACLIB.  Before you call IKJPARS, you have to
point Register 1 to the Parse Parameter List.

      The seven addresses of the Parse Parameter List are (in order):
The address of the UPT, the address of the ECT, the address of an
empty ECB (a fullword of hex zeros), the address of the PCL (the
Parameter Control List which is your IKJPARM thru IKJENDP macros), the
address of the "Answer Place"--a location to where IKJPARS will return
its results, a pointer to the Command Buffer, and finally, a pointer to
the User Work Area, which could be the program save area pointed to by
Register 13.

      IKJPARS returns the address of its results to the Answer Place,
and you inquire whether a parameter is present or not, by examining
keyword flags.  Look at Figure 1, for example.  If you want to see if
the keyword CPPL was specified with an invocation of LPSCB, just code
the instruction CLI  REALKW+1,1 .  To see if REAL was invoked, since
IKJNAME 'REAL' was coded after IKJNAME 'CPPL' under the same REALKW
IKJKEYWD macro, you code the instruction CLI REALKW+1,2 .  A Branch on
Equal (BE) indicates the presence of the keyword.  Obviously, if you
have two IKJNAME keywords coded under the same IKJKEYWD macro, it's
"either-or".  Only one of the two Branch on Equal statements will be
true.

Keeping Things Simple.

      I don't have space to discuss IKJPARS any further right now.
The other formal IBM constructs GETLINE, PUTLINE, and PUTGET are just
as complicated to use.  To simplify matters, I'd suggest looking into
the LPSCB code (or some other sample code), and then looking at IBM's
explanations in the TSO Programming Guide manual, which are quite
clear.  Practically speaking, once you've used these facilities one
time in a program, you can copy them over and over.  Just get them
straight once, and use them again and again.

      In my opinion, the IBM manuals tend to frighten people by making
them think you have to use all of the IBM facilities.  Much of the time,
you can get away without using most of them.  I'll show you:

      For a simple question that you want to ask a terminal user, it's
certainly easier to code a TPUT and a TGET macro rather than a PUTGET
macro.  For a simple informative message, you can code TPUT instead of
PUTLINE.  The downside of using the simpler TPUT macro, is that it can't
write output to a non-terminal, such as when you're running your program
under TSO-in-batch.  A lot of times, as I've indicated last month, you
can avoid using IKJPARS, if your requirements are very simple.  You can
also avoid using IKJDAIR or dynamic allocation, by putting out a
message, when the file open fails, saying that you have to allocate the
proper ddname to the program beforehand.  Error handling can also be
made very simple, with informative messages being sent to the terminal
via TPUT.  Really, in many cases, your TSO program can be made quite
uncomplicated, and it'll still do its job.

      So my job this month was to make you less scared to try writing
a TSO command for yourself.  My personal experience tells me that if
you try and fix another TSO command that has everything already coded,
it's a far less daunting experience, and you can learn the structures
more gradually.  One thing I can assure you:  If you break through,
and learn about TSO command processors, you'll get a very rewarding
and satisfying feeling about the "wonders" you can do.  Good luck.
See you next month.

            in the LPSCB TSO command.  Note that LPSCB has only
            keyword operands defined.  You can code either CPPL
            or REAL as a keyword.  Other optional keywords are:
            UPT, ECT, or ALL.  This defines a very simple operand
            structure.

Figure 2.   IKJPARS macros coded in the PRINTOFF command, from
            File 300 of the CBT Tape.  Note that there are both
            positional and keyword operands defined, and some
            of the keywords have possible subfields defined, to
            be coded between parentheses after the keyword
            statement.  For example, you can code COPIES(nnn),
            where nnn can be a 1- to 3-digit number.  The
            PRINTOFF command obviously needs a far more complex
            operand structure than the LPSCB command does.
            Note the optional HELP and PROMPT fields.  These tell
            IKJPARS what to inform the invoker, if there's a
            mistake in entering some of the operands.

Figure 3.   General steps to be taken in writing a TSO command
            processor program.  In any particular program, not
            all of these steps may be necessary.  This information
            is roughly paraphrased from the TSO/E Programmer's
            Guide.

       1.  Access the command processor parameter list (CPPL).

           Copy the four addresses, and the CPPL address, into
           a save area in your program.

       2.  Validate any operands entered with the command.

           You can code this yourself, or you can use the IBM
           Parser service, IKJPARS.

       3.  Communicate with the user at the terminal.

           You can use the TGET-TPUT combination of services,
           or you can use GETLINE-PUTLINE-PUTGET.

       4.  Perform the function of the command according
           to any operands the user specified.

           A TSO command is like any program.  It does
           what you design it to do.  Now go do it!

       5.  Recognize and pass control to any subcommands.

           If your program's design requires subcommand
           prompting, use PUTGET to issue a message and
           return a line of input from the terminal.  You
           get a buffer similar to the command buffer,
           which you have to parse for valid operands.
           Then you ATTACH a subprogram to complete the
           subcommand's task.

       6.  Intercept and process abnormal terminations.

           You can use the STAE or ESTAE macros to intercept
           abends and keep the program up.  But you don't
           have to do this, in many cases.

       7.  Respond to and process attention interruptions
           entered from the terminal.

           You can use the STAX macro instruction, to allow
           the program to take a meaningful action when the
           ATTENTION key is pressed by the user.

       8.  Set the return code in Register 15 and
           return control to the TMP, which called your
           program.  This way, you'll be able to show, in
           a general way, if your program worked properly
           or not.
