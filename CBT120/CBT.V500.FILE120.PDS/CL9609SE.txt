TIDBITS

      It's good to have friends.  I find that I have more friends
when I try to be a friend, but in any case, we try to help each other,
and we exchange tidbits of system information.  This month, we'll talk
about a few of these tidbits.


CHECKSUMS

      Recently, my friend Bruce Leland called me to say that he found
out how the AMASPZAP (IBM Superzap) CHECKSUM numbers work.  To refresh
your memory (if you ever heard of these things), the IBM superzap
program gives you a way of checking that you didn't make a mistake in
typing your ZAP control cards.  So after you type in your VER and REP
statements, you can write the word CHECKSUM on the next line
afterwards.  The AMASPZAP run will send you an AMA132I message that
the CHECKSUM was some four-byte hex number, and it's now 0.  The
actual ZAP will also complete.  If you now want to do another run of
this identical zap on another copy of the unzapped module, and you now
code the CHECKSUM keyword with this exact four-byte hex number
afterwards, you still get a good ZAP run.  But if the four-byte number
was different, the NO-GO switch will be set and the ZAP won't work.
Here is a good safeguard that all the VER and REP numbers were right.

      How these numbers are calculated is a mystery to most of the
people who ever heard of them in the first place.  Bruce found out
how it's done, and I think it should be a useful fact for you to
know.

      Figure 1 shows a typical AMASPZAP job, to change one byte in
load module PROGRAMA at displacement +1C0 into csect CSECTA from its
original value of hex 1D to hex 2D.  As the figure shows, you VERify
at displacement 01C0 in CSECTA of PROGRAMA, that its original value is
hex 1D.  If that is true, then you REPlace the value at that location
with the value of hex 2D.  For the purposes of accomplishing the ZAP,
it doesn't really matter if you express the displacement into CSECTA
as 01C0 or 0001C0.  However, for the purposes of calculating the
four-byte CHECKSUM value, we'll see that it makes a huge difference.

      To calculate this CHECKSUM value, we string out all of the
numbers, displacement and hex value, into four-byte chunks, padded
at the end with zeros.  Then we add all these four-byte numbers
together in hexadecimal to produce a four-byte sum, ignoring the
overflow.  The resulting sum is the CHECKSUM value.  Figure 2 shows
graphically how this is done.  As you can see there, if the second
byte at displacement +1C0 is hex F1, and this value will not be
changed by the zap, but we code the VERify and REPlace statements a
bit differently to reflect this, the CHECKSUM calculation comes out
completely different.  Everything depends on all the exact numbers in
the VER and REP statements.

      Now comes the 64 dollar question:  Why would it be helpful
for people like us to know this information?  The truth is that many
systems programmers have never seen a CHECKSUM statement in an
AMASPZAP job during their entire careers.  I still think that the
fact is useful to know.  One often knows how super-critical the
accuracy of a superzap has to be.  One "typo", and the system can
easily crash because of it.  How can one guarantee that all of
the many VER and REP statements in a complicated, but crucial ZAP
job, have been coded correctly, without a mistake?  This CHECKSUM
mechanism of IBM's can create that guarantee.  But it's helpful for
you to know how this works, because if you want to employ this
technique for ensuring the accuracy of your system zaps, you have
to know that zeros make a big difference, even though the actual
zapping effect might be the same.

      When you're the systems programmer assigned to create this
safeguard in your shop, it helps to know that the algorithm which
creates the CHECKSUM is not some magic mumbo-jumbo, but that you can
calculate it yourself to make sure it's right.  Now that all of you
possess this information, I'm sure that some shop somewhere will be
able to have enhanced "Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability"
because of it.


FIXING THE OLD LINKAGE EDITOR.

      Sometimes it makes you mad to see how some old "design
criterion" perpetuates itself to the point of silliness.  Everyone
knows that when you "Compile and Linkedit" or "Assemble and Linkedit"
a program, the 80-byte card-image object deck cannot be blocked bigger
than 3200 bytes, otherwise the Linkage Editor can't accept it as its
input.  This restriction existed from time immemorial, from the
infant beginnings of System/360, when central storage was at a
premium, and you had to fight for every byte of it.  Apparently, the
IBM software engineers didn't want a Linkage Editor run to consume
many central storage bytes, so they restricted the size of the chunks
of data input to be fed into it.  3200 bytes was to be the biggest
chunk.

      Nowadays, this restriction goes counter to the current IBM
policy.  Modern machines possess relatively huge quantities of central
storage, to the point where operations that were formerly performed by
doing I/O to disk, are now done in central storage.  IBM is touting
this change in its software very obviously and loudly.  So what
happened with the Linkage Editor?

      The answer is, absolutely nothing.  The linkage editor is
maintained by a different group, and they didn't, for some reason,
want to mess with it.  Today, we will show you the kind of change
which will fix the Linkage Editor, so that the object decks can be
blocked as big as 32720 bytes.  The change is extremely simple, and
you'll have a good laugh.  IBM, to be sure, has actually addressed
this problem in its software.  The new Binder, which replaces the old
Linkage Editor in the newest MVS and OS/390 systems, has had the
"3200-byte input" restriction removed.  However, IBM continues to
supply a copy of the old Linkage Editor with DFSMS, under the program
name of HEWLKED.  Even though you get the new Binder if you execute
PGM=HEWL, you can still get the old Linkage Editor if you execute
PGM=HEWLKED.

      I recently examined this DFSMS version of HEWLKED, and lo and
behold, the "3200-byte input" restriction is very much alive and well.
(Perhaps this month, this column should be printed on the humor page.)
Look at Figure 3 for some AMASPZAP input that will get rid of this
restriction, once and for all, in the DFSMS copy of the Linkage
Editor.  I have placed several versions of this simple modification,
adjusted to various maintenance levels of the Linkage Editor, in the
CBT MVS Utilities Tape, on File 257.  You can order copies of this
encyclopedic and very useful tape through the NaSPA office.  See
Figure 3 for a copy of this modification.

      As you see, the 3200-byte limit is actually hard-coded, and
in reality it could have been adjusted to any value which is a
multiple of 80.  Our zap can be easily fitted to any extant version
of the Linkage Editor by finding the appropriate displacements into
modules HEWLFINT and HEWLFAPT.  Just look for the appropriate binary
values, aligned on halfwords, at approximately the displacements
listed.  For help in doing this, I use the free FULLSCREEN ZAP program
from File 134 of the CBT MVS Tape, which has a "find" function, and
which can effortlessly spot the halfwords X'0C80' which is 3200 in
decimal, and the X'0028' which is 40 in decimal (the count of 80-byte
records in a 3200-byte block).

      Again, I don't know how useful you'll find this information.
What I can tell you, is that it seems that IBM is not changing the
program HEWLKED at all, so these displacements to fix your DFSMS copy
of the old Linkage Editor, should probably be quite stable.  If you
get used to using the Binder, without the blocking restriction, and
then you use the Linkage Editor and get burned, you might think of
trying out this fix.  In any case, it is a nice illustration of
"vendor old fogeyness" that all of us will enjoy.


ENJOYING OLD CODE.

      I'd like to conclude this month's installment with the
announcement of a new public tape.  The CBT MVS Utilities Tape got
to a point where it filled up, so some of the software had to be
deleted.  It's proprietor didn't want to render the deleted code
"permanently unavailable" to the public, so it was decided to create a
new CBT Overflow Tape, which would be distributed by the same people
who distribute the regular CBT Tape.  The new CBT Overflow Tape has
"slots" for 472 files, just like the regular CBT Tape, and is in the
same format.

      It didn't seem to pay to make an entire tape with just a little
bit of code, so more "unavailable code" was added, and the new tape,
in its Version 406V, now contains a lot of other code.  The German,
Swiss, English, and Australian G.U.I.D.E. tapes are there, as well
as a fine ISPF collection that was going to be distributed by the
SHARE organization, but which never was.  This collection was to be
called the "SHARE ISPF Smoke and Mirrors Tape".  In addition, in
Version 406V, the contents of the entire SHARE MVS MODS TAPE, all
131 files, is included.  This will allow users of the old SHARE code
to have a place to submit fixes.  Also, that code will continue to
remain available and useful to the public.

      In summary, I think that although much of this information is
"on the lighter side" and kind of peripheral, there is still quite a
bit to be learned from it.  I always feel that no matter what you
learn, there will eventually be a place for it to be used and useful.
Good luck.  See you next month.

Figure 1.   A Sample AMASPZAP Job including the correct CHECKSUM.

            In load module PROGRAMA, in CSECT CSECTA, you want to
            go to displacement +1C0 in CSECTA.  You want to verify
            that one byte at this location contains the value X'1D'.
            If that's true, then you want to change this value to
            X'2D'.

Figure 2.   How to calculate the CHECKSUM from your VER and REP
            statements.  You see that zeros in the expression of
            the module displacements, make a big difference in the
            CHECKSUM calculation, because everything depends on
            lining up all the numbers on a four-byte boundary.
            Let's use, for example, the numbers from Figure 1.


 VER  01C0 1D
 REP  01C0 2D

 All of these numbers are strung onto a four-byte boundary and
 padded with zeros as follows:

           01C01D01
           C02D0000

 Then the numbers are all added together in hexadecimal arithmetic,
 to produce the CHECKSUM number.

           C1ED1D01

 And that's all there is to it.  You see that zeros make a big
 difference.  For example, suppose the VER and REP statements were:

 VER  0001C0 1DF1
 REP  0001C0 2DF1

 which would produce the same effect in the zapped module, however
 the CHECKSUM would be calculated:

           0001C01D
           F10001C0
           2DF10000

 And these three hex numbers would be added together, producing
 a CHECKSUM of:

           1EF2C1DD

 with the overflow being ignored.  (Quite simple, really.)

            Note that these restrictions are hard-coded.
