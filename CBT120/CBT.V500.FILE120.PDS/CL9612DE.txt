ON FINDING THINGS

      This month, I'd like to discuss some novel approaches to solving
system programming problems, all of which have to do with finding
things.  Once you see some examples and you understand what we're
doing, you'll be able to come up with your own extensions to these
techniques, or you can use them as is.  I can testify that many
problems which seemed difficult to approach with other methods, have
fallen rather quickly when they were looked at from this angle.

      There are several different categories of "finding" which will
concern us.  Each category is a different type.  The overall watchword
for all of them is "speed".  Also, the reason I am mentioning these
particular categories here, is that standard IBM MVS techniques leave
large gaps in all of the areas we will talk about today.  I'd bet that
many sysprogs, hearing what we're doing, will say:  "I really didn't
know there was a way to do that!"

      Let's start our discussion with an overview of the different
categories of "finding" that we will talk about.  First, is the
problem of finding all occurrences of a particular member name in a
concatenated list of partitioned datasets.  This category lies at the
root of many common system problems.  For example, suppose you have
several versions of the same program name in various libraries of the
linklist concatenation, and you've encountered an error in this
program's execution.  Are you executing the right version of the
program?  This situation has to be diagnosed correctly.  Another
example:  Suppose you have a jobstream which executes cataloged
procedures.  Is the job executing the correct version of your PROC?
Maybe there are multiple versions in different libraries, and the
correct PROC wasn't in a library that's higher in the list than an
incorrect PROC.  In modern versions of JES, the name of the procedure
library containing the PROC is reported.  That's good once the job was
run.  But to diagnose the situation beforehand, or to obtain other proc
libraries containing a PROC with this name, do you have a good
technique?

      The next category involves finding all occurrences of a data
string which occur in multiple pds members, or in an entire library.
If this can be done quickly, there are myriads of system problems which
can be diagnosed using such an approach.  In former times, I would use
this method to discover the causing component of IBM system problems.
This is an example of the way it worked.  Suppose I had a system problem
that produced an unusual IBM message.  I would search SYS1.LPALIB for
all occurrences of the message string (or part of it).  This would show
me some module names, and the message string within the load module.
Then I would look in the Logic Manual (remember those?) to see how the
module worked, and I would look in IBMlink or call the Support Center
to see if any APARs were reported for these modules.  Of course,
nowadays the message manual often reports which module produced each
message, but even so, this information isn't always mentioned for some
components.  Our technique is still very handy nowadays as a backup
source of information.

      A third category involves creating a list of all member names
in a pds which contain a specific data string.  This can be used in
conjunction with "find-replace" maintenance.  For example, suppose a
dataset is renamed, and you want to find all JCL streams or PROCs
which reference the dataset.  Then you can edit each member
containing the dataset name, and fix it properly.  Another example:
Suppose you are searching in your own large JCL library, or in
someone else's JCL library, and you want to find an example of an
IEBCOPY or an IEHINITT job.  If you have an appropriate searching
tool, you can come up with a list of members containing PGM=IEBCOPY
or PGM=IEHINITT, or whatever string which would be indicative of the
type of job you are looking for.

      All of these three "finding categories", if they can be
implemented with speed, can greatly help any system programmer in many
areas of our everyday work.  In the rest of this column, I'll try and
suggest possible tools, among free products or vendor products, which
will help achieve these results.  Many free tools can be obtained from
the CBT MVS Utilities Tape, an independently produced huge software
collection, which can be ordered through the NaSPA office.  In this
column, I often refer to tools in various files of the CBT Tape, because
those materials can be obtained by any MVS shop, without requiring a big
budget.


FINDING MEMBERS IN A DATASET CONCATENATION

      The principal MVS service which detects the presence or absence
of a member in a partitioned dataset is the BLDL service which is
implemented in SVC 18 (module IGC018).  BLDL can either be run against
an individual dataset or a concatenation.  There is one hitch.  If a
utility runs BLDL against a dataset concatenation, only the first
occurrence of the member is reported.  Other occurrences afterward can
only be shown if the utility opens the datasets following as individual
datasets.

      REXX also has an implicit BLDL service built into it,
implemented by the SYSDSN keyword.  My late colleague, Tony Forte,
wrote some nice REXX execs which take advantage of this service.
Tony's REXX execs may be found on the CBT MVS Utilities Tape, File
219.  Tony's LNKLOOK exec searches all of the Link List libraries for
occurrences of a load module name.  One enters LNKLOOK followed by a
module name, for example:  LNKLOOK IEFACTRT.  Tony's JESLOOK exec finds
all occurrences of a PROC name in all the libraries of the JES2 proc
PROC00 concatenation.  For example, one enters:  JESLOOK CAS9 to find
all occurrences of the PROC CAS9 in all PROC00 proclib libraries.
Sample results from these two REXX execs are shown in Figure 1.

      A brand new tool in this category has been introduced with
ISPF Release 4.2.  It is a TSO command whose name is ISRDDN.  If you
type the command TSO ISRDDN on an ISPF command line, a panel displaying
all the dataset allocations in your TSO session will be shown.  Line
commands and primary commands may be entered on this panel.  If you
enter the primary command MEMBER followed by a member name, all datasets
allocated to your TSO session which contain that member name will be
marked.  It is easy to see how you can use this tool.  Simply run a
CLIST that allocates a dataset concatenation you want to look at, and
then, in ISRDDN, enter its MEMBER primary command using the name you
want to search for.  ISRDDN has many other functions also.  It is worth
your while to invest some time learning how to use it.

      A third type of tool that is in this category is a free TSO
command called LOCATE, which works for load modules.  One place where
you can find source code for this type of program is on File 270 of
the CBT Tape.  LOCATE will show occurrences of any program name, if it
exists on your system.  The program version on File 270 will (by
default) show the first occurrence of the program and (optionally)
show all occurrences of the program.  I have seen other versions of
LOCATE which behave a bit differently, but they are all useful.  One
good use of LOCATE, since it shows TTR disk locations of the program
name, is to verify if an LLA refresh of the program was done.  LOCATE
does a BLDL for the program name, and BLDL uses the LLA service.  If
no refresh for a new program version has been done, LOCATE will show
LLA's TTR location for the program, while a purely disk-based
browser, such as REVIEW (CBT Tape File 134) will show the new TTR
location.  If they differ, you know that the LLA refresh was not yet
done.


FINDING STRINGS IN PDS MEMBERS

      The "champion tool" that I've found in my work, which finds
strings in partitioned dataset members (source or load), is the PDS
TSO command that can be found on File 182 of the CBT MVS Tape.  There
is a stabilized free version of "PDS", Version 8.4, on the CBT tape,
which is available to all.  The currently supported version of PDS is
a vendor product called STARTOOL (formerly PDSTOOLS) that is
distributed by Serena International of Burlingame, California.  I do
not like to write about vendor products in this column.  But I am
mentioning both products here, because for this purpose, although the
vendor product is much better and has PDSE support, the free version
is good enough.  "Free PDS" will be very helpful to shops that don't
have STARTOOL.

      The PDS command can be used in either of two modes:  line mode
or ISPF mode.  Internally to the product, the ISPF mode is referred to
as ISPMODE.  ISPMODE operation of PDS is generally the better way to
go, but most of our techniques will operate in either mode.  Line mode
operation of PDS will also work under TSO-in-batch.

      The PDS command must point to a dataset.  We will give an
example.  Suppose we want to find all occurrences of a message string
in SYS1.LPALIB.  If PDS is installed, we issue the command:  PDS
'SYS1.LPALIB'.  Once we enter PDS, either in line mode or ISPMODE,
we enter a subcommand, FIND.  Our purpose is to find all occurrences
of a message string in all members of SYS1.LPALIB, or in a subgroup
of members.  PDS keeps track of subgroups of members in many ways,
but once a subgroup is established, the user can reference the current
member subgroup with an asterisk, '*'.  If the user wants to reference
all members of a pds, a colon ':' is used.

      To accomplish our immediate purpose of finding all occurrences
of a data string in SYS1.LPALIB, we enter the subcommand:
        FIND : /string/
The result of this command is a quick summary of all occurrences of
the data string in the entire SYS1.LPALIB.  This will accomplish the
aim of the second category of "finding" which we mentioned above.
However, the usefulness of the PDS command does not stop there.
We can easily accomplish the aim of the third category of "finding",
too.

      The FIND subcommand of PDS has THEN and ELSE logic attached to
it.  You can create a member subgroup which consists of all members
in which the data string has been found.  This can be done in several
ways, but the most general is to enter the subcommand under PDS:
        FIND : /string/ THEN(SUBLIST)
The result of this command is that a member subgroup is created, which
consists of a list of only those member names which contain the
specified data string.  As we mentioned before, this subgroup of
members can be referred to, in subsequent PDS subcommands, by using an
asterisk '*' instead of the colon ':'.

      Let's finish by showing how PDS can easily accomplish the third
type of "finding".  Suppose we have changed a dataset name, mentioned
frequently in SYS1.PROCLIB, from SYS1.USER.LOADLIB to SYS1.USERLIB.
To fix all JCL in SYS1.PROCLIB, simply point PDS to SYS1.PROCLIB using
the initial command:  PDS 'SYS1.PROCLIB', or if PDS is already running
and is pointing to a different dataset, enter the subcommand:
CHANGE 'SYS1.PROCLIB'.  To establish a member group containing the
string, SYS1.USER.LOADLIB, enter the subcommand:
        FIND : /SYS1.USER.LOADLIB/ THEN(SUBLIST)
Then, we can do either of two things.  In ISPMODE, we can create a
member sublist consisting of only members containing the string
SYS1.USER.LOADLIB.  This will enable us to conveniently edit only
those members, using the ISPF editor.  The PDS ISPMODE command which
does this is:  MEMLIST * RESET .  PDS also has an additional "string
replacement" feature which does an in-place rewrite of the records.
The string replacement is invoked using the PDS "REPLACE" subcommand.
One invokes the command:
        REPLACE * /SYS1.USER.LOADLIB/SYS1.USERLIB/
to do a dry run and display the results of the string replacement.
This may be done with PDS running in line mode or TSO-in-batch.
To make the changes final, enter:
        REPLACE * /SYS1.USER.LOADLIB/SYS1.USERLIB/ WRITE
That's all there is to it, folks.  Mission accomplished.  If you try
the PDS command for yourself, you'll also see that it works very fast.

      I trust that the techniques we've mentioned this month will
be helpful to you.  In the past, I've been able to make short work
of some humongous tasks, using them.  At the very least, they are
time-saving and very convenient.  Good luck and "happy finding".
