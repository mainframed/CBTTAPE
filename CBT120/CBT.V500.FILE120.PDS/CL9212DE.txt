PUTTING YOUR TOOLS TOGETHER - PART I.

      In practical work, we have problems to solve and tasks to do.
Each one of us must marshal the tools we have available to attack the
task at hand.  For the past four years, much of this column was
devoted to adding "another tool" to your collection of "weapons".
Now, I'd like to change focus a bit.

      Consideraions that affect the speed of our work are the main
topic we shall deal with in these next few issues.  How can you
arrange your tools so they are all at hand and ready quickly?  How can
you bring all your firepower to bear on your current problem, now!

      Just as important as having a tool installed, is being able to
deploy it quickly when it is needed.  We want to find ways of getting
the immediate use of a tool right now, to be able to throw the tool at
the problem right in front of us.  For example, if you have to look at
some output, you wouldn't want to interrupt your current work.  If you
need to allocate a new dataset, you'd like to do it without
interrupting what you're currently in the middle of.  In this month's
article, I'll show you how to get this accomplished, and do much more.

      Learning how to quickly use your tools is as much a part or our
trade as owning the tools.  We continually work to refine "technique"
skills as we progress in our careers.  Every software product we use
contains special command sequences or fine points, to help us do our
jobs better.  Knowledge of these commands is sometimes crucial to
performing quick and accurate work.  When it is relevant, I'll bring
such commands into our discussion.

      What shall we talk about?  We will have to split this subject
into several installments because there are different topics that must
be mentioned.  Probably the most important one is ISPF command table
entry customization.  Using ISPF command tables cleverly is probably
the easiest way to obtain speed at your work.  We'll discuss ISPF
command tables today.  Next time, I'd like to mention the big software
toolsets which integrate multiple function.  The one I am most
familiar with is the vendor product PDSTOOLS and its far more
primitive predecessor the PDS TSO command.  This tool alone allows you
to throw hundreds of utility operations at one problem in a minimum
amount of time.  Then I'd like to discuss native TSO, both with and
without ISPF.  TSO itself was invented to quickly accomplish work on
the system.  I want to talk about TSO Command tools in general, both
IBM-supplied, and tools written by users outside of IBM.  We shall
also talk about ISPF edit macro power, and we'll bring in other
integration hints.

      The emphasis in this series will be on integrating multiple
function.  We want to make different software operations available
"close together" to quickly deploy the maximum firepower we need to
get a job done.  It all means increased productivity, and saved
hours.


WHY ISPF COMMAND TABLE ENTRIES ARE THE BEST WAY TO START.

      Wouldn't it be nice, when you need something on the computer,
to say to the computer (StarTrek style):  "Computer.  Get this for me."
And the computer will go ahead and get it.

      In my opinion, the most important step you can take to integrate
your tools, is learning how to customize ISPF command tables.  When
you enter a command on the command line in an ISPF screen, the command
table entries are scanned first.  The computer "goes ahead and gets
it" without further ado.  It's quick and direct.

      These command table entries have a lot of power.  They have full
access to the ISPF "SELECT" service.  This means that any ISPF action
which is accessible by a panel, is also just as accessible through
a direct command.  You tell the computer:  "Computer, get me this!"
And the computer does it, as long as you're under ISPF, and the command
is entered in the command table.

      Frequently accessed ISPF functions should be put in the command
tables.  This will be to your tremendous advantage for the following
reason:  In ISPF Versions 2 and 3, there is capability to perform
functions recursively, one function on top of another.  The first
function that you started with, isn't disturbed while a second
function is invoked that overlays the screen temporarily.  When you
exit from the second function, you're back in the first function
exactly where you left off.  This can all be done on one "split" of
the screen.  It doesn't affect the second split, which is available
at the same time for other maneuvers.

      This means that if you are in the middle of editing a member of
some dataset, you can invoke ISPF 3.2 (or any other function) "on top"
of the edit, without disturbing the edit.  Then you can allocate,
delete or inquire about the other dataset you need, press the END key
(PF3), and you're still in the edit where you were before.  You don't
have to be in the EDIT function to use command table entries.  You can
be in any ISPF function.  That's why good command table entries can be
more basic to your productivity than a collection of edit macros.

      I'm not telling you not to use edit macros.  In fact, we'll
discuss the great power of edit macros in a later issue.  I am asking
you to marshal your forces and use EVERYTHING you have.  Our emphasis
is to INTEGRATE YOUR POWER and have all functions available at your
fingertips.  ISPF commands are the quickest start to achieve this.
That's why command table entries are the best things to begin with.
They're instant, they are always available, and they don't disturb
your current work.


ADDING AND CHANGING ISPF COMMAND TABLE ENTRIES.

      ISPF tables, of which command tables are a subset, belong to
partitioned datasets that are accessed by two ddnames.  The input ddname
for tables is called ISPTLIB.  ISPTLIB is usually a concatenation of
datasets containing already prepared tables.  The output ddname for
tables is called ISPTABL.  When you change a table, it must be pointed
to by the ddname ISPTABL.  Most often, the ISPTABL ddname will point
to only one partitioned dataset.

      Command tables are certain members of an ISPF table dataset.
Command table members have a very specific naming convention.  In order
for a member to be a command table the last four letters of its name
must be "CMDS".  The APPLID of the ISPF application must be the
beginning of the member name.  For example, if the applid of the
current application is "ISR", then the command table entry governing
that application has to be named "ISRCMDS".  If the application name is
"GIM", then the governing command table must be called "GIMCMDS".

      There is an ISPF function whose specific purpose is to change
command table entries.  In most installations, this function is 3.9
from the standard PDF menu.  Upon entry, you'll see a screen that
asks you for the applid you want to look at.  You just enter the
applid name alone (for example:  ISR).  The function then looks for a
member in your ISPTABL ddname concatenation that is called ISRCMDS.
Then it will display a list of the current table entries for that
application.

      There is one catch.  A command table that is currently being
used by your ISPF/PDF session is enqueued upon; it may be browsed (in
ISPF version 3.2 or later), but it cannot be changed.  I have a
certain trick to get around this problem.  Suppose I want to change
the ISRCMDS table.  Under ISPF 3.9, this table (and ISPCMDS too) are
being enqueued upon by ISPF and cannot be changed by ISPF 3.9.  I
create an exact copy of the ISRCMDS member (using ISPF 3.3 member
copy) and call it XSRCMDS.  When the ISPF 3.9 entry screen asks me for
the applid, I enter "XSR".  See Figure 1.  This gives me the first
XSRCMDS member in the ISPTABL ddname concatenation.  Since XSR is not
a currently used ISPF application, I can change the XSRCMDS member by
adding and deleting table entries as I please.  Then I rename ISRCMDS
to another name, make a copy of XSRCMDS called ISRCMDS, and I make
sure the dataset is at the top of my ISPTLIB ddname concatenation.
For the new table to become active I just get all the way out of ISPF,
and go back into ISPF again.  If I want to make more changes to the
table, my XSRCMDS member is still an exact copy of ISRCMDS, so I am
still properly positioned to make further changes.  See Figures 2 and
3.

      Our initial goal in speeding up our work is not to require
panel entry to get to a function.  Figure 2 illustrates some SELECT
statements that may be found in the ISPF main menu panel called
ISR@PRIM.  Figure 3 shows how these same SELECT statements can be
converted into direct commands, so you can quickly access each
function without having to go through panels first and interrupting
your work.

      Now that we have an idea of how to change table members and
table entries, we'll discuss the kinds of changes we might make.  Our
aim is to enhance our ISPF sessions under TSO, so that access to our
tools becomes more quick.

      See Figure 3 for an illustration of what I've done to immediately
add power to my own ISPF sessions.

      My own scheme for adding commands is to prefix an "I" to a
normal ISPF function.  For example, if I want to create a command
to duplicate ISPF 3.2 dataset manipulation and inquiry, I name the
command "I32".  That makes the command easy to remember, and it does
not usually conflict with other ISPF and TSO commands.  Please see
Figure 3 for more specific details of what I've done.  Remember that
I've copied IBM's SELECT statements from IBM's panels, and the exact
wording of the statements might depend on which release of ISPF you
are running.  When you change releases, you have to review your
existing command tables to make them correspond to IBM's new panels.
I always make my changes to a copy of the IBM-supplied command table
from the current release of ISPF.

      Space is short and I have to end now.  Please use the figures
and do what you can to improve the state of life at your place.  Best
of luck.  See you next month.

FIGURE 1.   Command table edit entry panel from ISPF.  This panel
            is accessed from the PDF main menu by entering, "3.9".
            The bottom of the panel contains explanatory instruction
            written by IBM, as is illustrated.



------------------------ COMMAND TABLE UTILITY -------------------------
COMMAND ===>

ENTER/VERIFY APPLICATION ID BELOW:
  APPLICATION ID ===> XSR


The name of the command table to be processed is formed by prefixing
the application id to the string 'CMDS'.  For example:
  APPLICATION ID ===> TST
results in a command table name of 'TSTCMDS'.

FIGURE 2.   This is the SELECT service portion of the main ISPF/PDF
            menu panel named ISR@PRIM.  This part of the ISR@PRIM
            panel defines options or services that may be selected
            from the command line of the panel.  You are able to get
            into the different options allowed, because these
            invocation definitions are present in the "selection"
            part of the ISR@PRIM panel.  Please note that you can
            only get to these options from within the ISR@PRIM panel,
            but from nowhere else within ISPF or PDF.

            See Figure 3, which shows how these entries may be
            transformed into direct commands that may be executed
            from any ISPF command line while in application "ISR".

FIGURE 3.   This is a sample of a modified ISPF command table XSRCMDS
            which is copied to the member ISRCMDS of the table library
            pointed to by the ISPTABL ddname in ISPF under TSO.  Notice
            how SELECT statements in this table were copied from
            SELECT definitions that came from ISPF panels.  See Figure 2
            for comparison.  The commands in this table are much more
            easily accessible to an ISPF user.  You don't have to start
            from the ISR@PRIM panel to use these commands.  You can
            enter them from any ISPF command line.
