      This monthly column is for sharing practical advice and
techniques which can be employed in your shop.  I hope that every
reader will come away with something practical that can be immediately
used.  Our aim is to help MVS shops implement time-saving techniques
that are not hard to do, but which not everybody knows about.

      Readers are encouraged to contribute to this column.  We depend
on you for its continued success!  Contributions can be sent through
NASCOM, or you can write to me care of the Editor.  The contributor's
name will be mentioned when his technique is printed in this column.

      When software tools are required for any of the techniques, we
will try to use tools that are available to the public.  Of course,
if a vendor product suffices for a particular user, that is fine,
too.  There is a tremendous public domain literature of MVS tools.
Many useful tools can be found on NaSPA's own V.I.P. tapes, and we
will draw heavily from the Connecticut Bank and Trust MVS Mods tape,
known as the CBT tape.  A list of sources for MVS tools can be found
in the January issue of "Technical Support".

      This month, our first technique will concern ISPF COMMAND TABLE
ADDITIONS.  These simple-to-make upgrades will greatly improve the
efficiency of ISPF sessions.  With ISPF version 2, it is possible to
do five, ten, or more separate functions in the two ISPF splits, or
even in one split.  You don't have to lose a screen split just to
allocate a file or do a dataset list.  The technique is primarily for
releases of ISPF version 2, because these releases of ISPF will
support RECURSIVE EDITs and RECURSIVE BROWSEs.

      The concept of recursive edits is very simple.  Suppose you are
in the middle of editing a file.  From the command line, you execute a
CLIST or a command that calls another ISPF function to run inside the
same split of the screen.  If the called command or CLIST invokes the
ISPF EDIT function to do its work, it is clear that the EDIT function
was called TWICE FOR THE SAME SPLIT.  In ISPF version 2, this will
work, because multiple EDIT control blocks are created for each split.
In ISPF version 1, an abend will result.  A similar principle applies
for a call of the ISPF BROWSE function in the same split as a BROWSE
which is already being done.  Version 2 can handle it.  Version 1
can't.

      It is possible to RUN MANY ISPF FUNCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME by
taking advantage of the recursive ISPF invocations.  The question is
now, how can we recursively invoke a new ISPF function?

      One answer is in using the ISPF COMMAND TABLE.  The command
tables are part of your ISPF session.  Commands in the command table
are executed when they are entered from the command line of an ISPF
session.  COMMANDS CAN DUPLICATE ANY FUNCTION WHICH IS SELECTABLE FROM
A PANEL.  Our technique, then, is TO MAKE COMMANDS to invoke frequently
used PANELS directly, on top of the current screen.  This has the
advantage that upon END from the invoked panel, you're still in the
screen that was being used before.

      How do we do this?  A command table is a pds member allocated
to the ddname ISPTLIB or the ddname ISPTABL.  ISPTLIB is used for
output, and ISPTABL is used for input, so if you plan to update a
table, it must be in a library allocated to ISPTABL.  Command table
names adhere to the convention "applid"+CMDS.  In other words, the
name of the command table member is the name of the applid suffixed
by the string "CMDS".  ISPF option 3.9 is used for editing command
tables.  It assumes that your desired table is in a PDS allocated to
ddname ISPTABL, and that it IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING USED by any
session.  Therefore, you must update a COPY of the real table, and
not one that is in use.

      The ISPF 3.9 entry panel asks for the name of the command table
member, minus the "CMDS" suffix.  The normal default ISPF command
table members are called ISPCMDS and ISRCMDS, which we cannot edit
directly, so let's assume we have made copies of them in an ISPTABL
library, called XSPCMDS and XSRCMDS.  To edit XSPCMDS, we enter XSP
on the ISPF 3.9 entry panel screen, and we proceed to add or change
entries to the table.  After the table is saved by using the END key,
we can replace the ISPCMDS member by the XSPCMDS member, get out of
ISPF entirely, and then back into ISPF.  The new entries should now
be effective on our ISPF session.

      A lot of people know about ISPF command tables, so why are we
writing about them here?  The suggestion is as follows:  Take ALL
THE ISPF 3.x UTILITY FUNCTIONS and make COMMANDS to execute them
ON TOP OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.  Then you can do a dataset allocation
or a dataset list or a SUPERC, or even a command table edit, and not
lose your current screen which contains the work you're doing.

      For example, I'm doing an EDIT now, and I want to allocate a
new file.  I simply go to the command line and type DAT (for DATaset),
a command that I've set up.  Instantly the ISPF 3.2 prompt screen
comes up.  After I've allocated (or deleted) the dataset, I get out
of that function, and I'm back in my original EDIT, on the same
split of the screen.

      Here are some hints on how to make the table entries.

      Use the SELECT statements in the PROC section of your ISRUTIL
(ISPF 3) panel, to determine the correct statements to put into the
command table for the 3.x functions.  Panels are allocated to the
ddname ISPPLIB in your session.  This info should be of help in
locating your current panel whose name is ISRUTIL.  Just write the word
SELECT, and copy the select statements exactly, without the quotes,
just as they appear in the ISRUTIL panel.  You can alternatively copy
the entries from my sample table additions (which are for ISPF v2.3).
Please be aware that the utility invocations for ISPF v2.2 may be
slightly different from mine.

      Here's another hint in the process of exploring for commands:
The name of the panel currently being used can be displayed by
entering the command PANELID on the command line.  The actual name of
the panel will be displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.
PANELID OFF turns the panel name display off.

      COMMANDS CAN BE MADE TO SELECT ANY SCREEN.  I've included a
sample of some command table additions I've made.  Anyone can get
very creative with this, and really ease the burdens in his everyday
work.  Further assistance can be obtained from the IBM ISPF manuals.

      One should create a TSO HELP member called "CMDTABLE", which
keeps the names of the extra commands handy in case you forget them.
To get really fancy, the help can be in the form of a new panel that
is selected by a new command in the command table.

      Good luck with your own command table additions.  Because of
lack of space in this column, I have to eliminate extra detail, but
the included sample has extra hints and tips embedded right within
it.  Please examine it carefully.

 (Please note the corrections to the following material, which are
  appended to the end of this member.  Do not read the next few
  paragraphs without referring to the correction. )

      Now we go to topic number two, which was suggested by Bruce
Leland of Hitachi in California.  This concerns the peculiarities
of the Link Pack Area loading process, which loads system programs
and routines into the Link Pack Area (or LPA) at IPL time.  Knowing
one detail about this process can save much grief.

  (Please look at the postscript for correct answers in this topic.
   Do not look in the following paragraphs.  Thank you.)

      The detail concerns load modules which have alias entries
in the SYS1.LPALIB pds directory, and there are many such load modules
for any level of the MVS operating system.  An alias directory entry
in a pds LOAD MODULE directory will contain a field that has the name
of its MAIN MEMBER, and another field which has the displacement of
the alias' entry point from the beginning of the listed main member.

      Suppose we had a situation where load module MAINMEMB had
aliases ALIASA and ALIASB in SYS1.LPALIB.  Normally, all three
directory entries IN THE DISK PDS DIRECTORY for these three names
would point to the same actual disk location, which is ONE disk copy
of the module.  The LPA loader respects this condition also, and
loads ONE COPY of the module into virtual storage, with three entry
points pointing to it IN THE LPA DIRECTORY IN VIRTUAL STORAGE.

      Our USUAL perception of alias handling comes from how the
IEBCOPY DISK COPYING PROGRAM handles them.  In a normal case situation,
let us say we are installing MAINMEMB and its aliases ALIASA and
ALIASB into SYS1.LPALIB from another library.  We select members
MAINMEMB, ALIASA, and ALIASB in ONE IEBCOPY operation, and they get
copied together.  That is, ONE COPY of the load module and three
directory entries pointing to it, are created.

      If LATER, however, we do a SECOND IEBCOPY RUN to SYS1.LPALIB,
selecting ONLY MAINMEMB and not the aliases, a SECOND COPY of the
main member will be copied to SYS1.LPALIB.  The alias directory
entries will STILL POINT TO THE ORIGINAL DISK COPY, whereas the new
MAINMEMB entry will point to the new copy.

      What does the LPA Loader do when it sees this situation at
IPL time?  It figures as follows:  THE ALIASES ARE PROBABLY RIGHT.
The new main member is probably a different version of the program.
Since we want to have complete consistency in SYSTEM OPERATION, and
since a failure can only be corrected by a new IPL, which means a
system outage, the LPA Loader uses only the disk copy pointed to by
the ALIAS members, and CONSTRUCTS A MAIN MEMBER ENTRY in the LPA
directory in virtual storage that is consistent with THE COPY POINTED
TO BY THE ALIASES.  THE ISOLATED MAIN MEMBER IS THROWN OUT, and a
message is issued to the operator console (often missed by the
operators) that this has been done.

      It doesn't take much imagination to realize that problems
can occur if we try to INCORE ZAP this module in LPA.  The standard
incore zap program looks at the disk copy of the module to determine
its structure, and then goes to the core copy to make the changes.
If they are in fact different versions, we can get very confused.

      A good preventive solution would be an overall diagnosis of
SYS1.LPALIB to find these inconsistencies BEFORE IPL TIME.  Fortuately,
a good tool is available for this in the PDS PROGRAM PRODUCT on the
CBT tape, file 182.  The PDS subcommand called "VERIFY" will check
for all inconsistencies connected with load modules and their aliases.
If one points the PDS program to the currently used SYS1.LPALIB and
issues a VERIFY command for all members, the abnormalities displayed
may be quite shocking.  I know.  I've tried it.  This small step
can cure multiple mysterious system problems in advance.  You must,
of course, use your head, and your understanding of MVS, in dealing
with what you find.  That's what System Programmers get paid their
high salaries for.  However, the fact of discovery is a good eye
opener.

      Time has grown short for this month.  In ending our current
session, I'd like to inform our readership of the existence of an
excellent, though complicated FULL SCREEN EDITOR PRODUCT.  It is
called ABE, for "A Better Editor".  ABE is written in PL1.  It
requires the Transient Library of the PL1 Optimizing Compiler in
order to run.  It has enormous capability.  It is therefore not easy
to learn, but it has two advantages.  First, it is free.  Second,
it does very complicated functions, and it runs in batch also, although
its normal functioning is under TSO.

      The ABE editor is not for everyone.  MVS installations which
do not have ISPF may be interested in looking at it.  People who use
editors in complicated ways may also be interested.  For those who
want a look, ABE may be found on a V.I.P tape in the near future,
or it can be obtained from Tom G. Smith at Kimberly-Clark in Neenah,
Wisconsin.

             May 1989 MVS Tools and Tricks of the Trade

POSTSCRIPT:

      I have to report a subsequent development and a retraction.
The retraction is about a mistake I made in my March column.  The
subsequent development concerns our current article.  I will describe
what happened when IBM fixed the "ACCEPTED" PTF in error which I had
"backed off".

      This month's subject first.

      IBM's bad PTF which I had ACCEPTED, number UY31933, had
affected module APSQDEQ, which I had replaced with the base level of
that module, calling the fix by the APAR sysmod number of AZ19870.
My APAR "fixing sysmod" AZ19870 was given a PRE of the bad sysmod,
UY31933.

      At the time, I had figured that IBM WOULD REPLACE THE BAD
MODULE APSQDEQ when it would come out with a fixing PTF to supersede
my APAR fix called AZ19870.

      IBM crossed me up.  When they corrected the problem described
by APAR AZ19870, they fixed a completely different module to solve the
problem.  The new PTF from IBM ASSUMED THAT MODULE APSQDEQ WOULD
REMAIN AT RMID LEVEL UY31933.  If I would have APPLYed IBM's NEW PTF,
then the module APSQDEQ WOULD STILL BE AT BASE LEVEL, and WOULD BE
INCOMPATIBLE with THE OTHER MODULE THAT GOT FIXED.

      My solution was simple, but it shows that any tampering with
IBM's scheme of fixes must be done very carefully.  All that needed to
be done was to RESTORE MY APAR SYSMOD AZ19870 (which unAPPLYs it).
This action would return module APSQDEQ back to its original RMID level
that would be compatible with THE OTHER MODULE WHICH IBM ACTUALLY
REPLACED.  We back out our fix FIRST, and this accomplishes what IBM
intended.  Our tampering is removed, and IBM's fix is properly put in
its place.

      The danger lies in APPLYing IBM's fixing PTF blindly, before
undoing our own tampering.  IBM's PTF would have superseded our APAR
number, making it impossible for us to RESTORE it afterwards, and the
two modules in the system would remain at incompatible levels.  In
retrospect, it may have been better NOT TO ASSIGN IBM's APAR NUMBER to
our tampering SYSMOD; we would later be able to RESTORE it off.
But the problem would still be that we would never have gotten an ID
CHECK to alert us when we tried to put on IBM's fix, no matter what
number we had assigned.  That is because IBM ACTUALLY FIXED A
DIFFERENT MODULE THAN THE ONE IN ERROR.  THE RMID OF IBM's FIXED
MODULE WOULD NOT INTERACT, UNDER SMP, WITH THE RMID OF OUR BACKED-OFF
MODULE.  Because we had no way of knowing what IBM would do, we could
never have second-guessed that occurrence in advance.

      The moral of the story is:  YOU MUST ALWAYS BE CAREFUL
WHEN IT COMES TO SMP.

      Now to my mistake in the March column.

      This concerns what I had said regarding how MVS System
Initialization loads the Pageable Link Pack Area, or PLPA, at IPL
time, when a load module in SYS1.LPALIB does not correspond to its
aliases.

      Please be assured that it is still very important to check
SYS1.LPALIB to make sure that all main modules correspond to their
aliases.  "Orphaned aliases" or "apparent aliases" may still cause
problems, and these problems should be eliminated in advance.  As
I said in the original March column, a "VERIFY" run on SYS1.LPALIB
using the public-domain PDS command processor (CBT Mods Tape file
182) before IPL of the system, is probably the best preventive of
any trouble.  The PDS VERIFY will flag all "bad situations" so
they can be fixed.  See POSTSCRIPT FIGURE ONE for an illustration
of a VERIFY run.

      My mistake was in my explanation of what MVS system
initialization does if there is a lack of correspondence between a
module in SYS1.LPALIB and its aliases.  The correct scenario follows,
and I thank Bruce Leland for helping me here.

      At this point, I urge you to refer to POSTSCRIPT FIGURE TWO,
which displays a load module alias directory entry.  This will
crystallize the situations in your mind.

      THE CORRECTED PRINCIPLE IS:  THE PLPA LOADING ONLY LOADS MAIN
MEMBERS, AND ALIASES ARE ONLY REFERRED TO BY THE DISPLACEMENT FROM THE
ENTRY LOAD POINT LOCATION OF THE MAIN MEMBER.  THE ALIAS ENTRY POINT
IS DERIVED BY ADDING THE DISPLACEMENT AMOUNT (FROM FIELD PDS2EPA) TO
THE LOAD POINT OF THE MAIN MEMBER.  Now to describe some cases.

CASE   1A.

      Module A1 is an alias.  Its real member, indicated in the
     PDS2MNM field of the directory, does not exist in SYS1.LPALIB.

     System Action:  The alias is not loaded into PLPA, and its
            name is discarded.  Messages are issued (IEA301I and
            IEA356I on my system) that the alias will be discarded.


CASE   1B.

      Module A1 is an alias.  Its real member, indicated in the
     PDS2MNM field of the directory, exists, but is marked as
     an alias in SYS1.LPALIB.

     System Action:  The alias is not loaded into PLPA, and its
            name is discarded.  Messages are issued (IEA301I and
            IEA356I on my system) that the alias will be discarded.


CASE   2A.

      A1 is a real member of SYS1.LPALIB.  A2 thru A9 are its aliases.

      If A1 is renamed using TSO RENAME or ISPF 3.1 RENAME, the
     main member fields in the directory entries of A2 thru A9 are
     unchanged by the rename of their main member.  Thus it appears
     that A2 thru A9 do not have a main member.  (The RENAME function
     that comes with the "PDS" product, will not fall into this pitfall
     and will adjust the PDS2MNM fields of all aliases when the main
     member is renamed.)

     System Action:  These aliases are not loaded into PLPA, and the
            names A2 thru A9 are discarded.  Messages are issued
            (IEA301I and IEA356I on my system) that these aliases
            will be discarded.  This situation is pretty pernicious,
            because probably nobody will notice the messages at IPL
            time.


CASE   2B.

      A1 is a real member of SYS1.LPALIB.  A2 thru A9 are its aliases.

      If A2 thru A9 are renamed using TSO RENAME or ISPF 3.1 RENAME,
     the main member field of each of them is unchanged.

     System Action:  Since the main member A1 still exists,
            LPDE (Link Pack Directory Entry) entries will be
            created for the renamed aliases under their new
            names.  This may or may not be what you want.


CASE   3.

      A1 is a real member of SYS1.LPALIB.  A2 thru A9 are its aliases.

      A1 is recompiled from different source and relinked into
     SYS1.LPALIB, but without ALIAS control cards for the eight
     aliases A2 thru A9.

     System Action:  THIS IS THE MOST PERNICIOUS CASE OF ALL.
            Since the main member exists for all of the aliases,
            NO WARNING MESSAGES ARE ISSUED.  However, since the
            main member was compiled from different source, the
            ACTUAL ALIAS ENTRY POINTS MAY BE AT DIFFERENT
            DISPLACEMENTS THAN THOSE INDICATED BY THE PDS2EPA
            FIELDS OF EACH ALIAS.  When an attempt is made to
            access the module through an alias name, the point
            of attempted entry may actually not be an entry
            point, and a "mysterious abend" or other mishap
            will result.


      I hope this sets the record straight.  The reader is referred
to the "MVS System Initialization Logic" manual for his system, and
also to the fiche for module IEAVNP05, which does the PLPA loading.

POSTSCRIPT FIGURE TWO.


    This is an actual PDS (version 8.2) "DIRENTRY" display of
     an ALIAS entry of a load module.  Fields of the directory
     entry are described below the hexadecimal display.

    The fields PDS2MNM (at +24 in this example) and
     PDS2EPA (at +1B in this case) concern us the most.
