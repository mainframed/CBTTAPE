      This month, I'd like to deal with an area in which many people
think there is not much room for improvement.  I sharply disagree, and
I hope that we can stimulate some activity and inventiveness in this
area among our readership.

      The topic of discussion comes in two parts.  The first part
deals with massaging SMP inputs (SMPPTFIN-format files) and reporting
on their contents, independent of real SMP/E processing.  The second
part deals with notions of feeding the outputs of SMP/E runs back
into subsequent SMP/E runs.  I have done some work in both of these
categories, but I feel there is much more to be done of value to
benefit all of us.

      I wish to begin the discussion with a focus on a CBT-tape file,
File 118, which contains several programs:  an assembler program
called PUTXREF from Jerry Lawson of the Hartford Insurance Group, and
several COBOL programs written by me.  There are several types of
SMPPTFIN processing that can be done with these programs.  I'll try,
within the scope of this month's writing, to cover some different
things that can be done.

      The purpose of Jerry Lawson's PUTXREF program is to take
any SMPPTFIN file, containing PTFs, APARs, USERMODs, or FUNCTIONs,
and produce a report sorting all of these SYSMODS by their owning
FMID (a product ownership designation which is used by SMP/E
processing).  See Figure One for a sample of what this report looks
like.  Thus, given a collection of maintenance SYSMODs in SMP format,
it is easily and practially possible to determine which products this
maintenance is for, without involving any real SMP processing at all.

      Practically speaking, you can run the PUTXREF report against a
PUT tape file, or a CBIPO or CBPDO SMPMCS file, to determine if the
proper profile of maintenance for program products was shipped to your
installation by IBM.  It is useful to have this FMID report BEFORE
RECEIVEing the maintenance on your system, because it would be nice to
know that the product mix was correctly shipped to you.  Often,
profile errors occur in such shipments, and the right maintenance PTFs
don't get to you.  Early notification of this would certainly be
useful for the timely correction of IBM's mistakes, BEFORE your system
is affected.

      I haven't stopped at Jerry's implementation of pre-SMP FORFMID
processing.  I have written a COBOL post-processor to the PUTXREF
output report called SMPFMUPV, which converts the FMID-sorted report
of SYSMODs into an actual CARD-IMAGE FILE of SYSMOD numbers sorted by
owning FMID, with all duplicate SYSMOD numbers removed.  This makes
the list of SYSMODs suitable for input into a subsequent SMP job.  See
Figure Two for an sample illustration of what this file looks like.
See Figure Three for sample JCL that will run the entire processing in
one stream.

      There are obviously many uses for such information.  Large
PTF files can be analyzed for their content, BEFORE they are used.
Your installation does not have to make a commitment to installing a
collection of system maintenance until a pre-analysis of the
maintenance has been performed, and the scope of the contents
determined to the satisfaction of the systems staff.  Several kinds of
IBM shipping errors can be immediately spotted, and corrections
ordered without unnecessary delay.

      We can suggest a few miscellaneous applications at this point.
For one example:  PTF tape shipments can be routinely pre-analyzed
for FMID mix at the time they arrive.  Older product releases that are
being gradually "stabilized" can be pointed out and noted, through the
now "obvious" reduction in the number of PTF fixes belonging to their
FMIDs.  Another example:  Better control in single-product maintenance
upgrades can be attained, if pre-knowledge of all maintenance PTF
numbers belonging to that product has been gathered in advance of any
SMP run.  A third example:  Entire PTS datasets can be analyzed for
FMID consideration of their contents, to determine if REJECT processing
for components of obsolete products should be carried out (see Figure
Four for an illustration of JCL to do this).

      Given the type of information that we're gathering, you, our
esteemed readers, can figure out other handy uses for such data, and
neater ways to deal with it.

      I'll go just another step, to show you how I currently use
these programs in my own shop.

      When a PUT tape comes in, I run four jobs.  The first job
copies the first ten files of the tape to disk.  The second job does
a TAPEMAP (CBT tape File 299) of the PUT tape, followed by a PUTXREF
run to produce a FORFMID report for the PTFs on the tape.  The two
TAPEMAP reports and the PUTXREF report are copied to three members of
a partitioned dataset having LRECL=133.  The names of these members
contain the PUT level within them for later reference.  The third job
is essentially a SMPFMUPV run that converts the PUTXREF report for
the PUT tape into a card-image "FORFMID" file.  Figure Three
illustrates a combination of my second and third jobs against a PUT
tape.  Finally, the fourth job converts the entire input SMPPTFIN
file into a partitioned dataset with each PTF separated as a separate
member for easy browsing.  This last job will be the final subject of
our article, but I want to first explain the practical usefulness of
the first three jobs to me.

      By collecting the TAPEMAP and PUTXREF reports into one PDS,
I can make use of the fabulous "PDS program product" (CBT tape files
182, 296, and 112) or its vendor-supported extension called PDS/E.
The "PDS" program products have a "global string find" capability
over an entire partitioned dataset, or over any subcollection of its
members.  By looking for all occurrences of an FMID name, or of a
given PTF number, I can quickly do all the necessary research that
I need, before actually attempting to put the maintenance on my
system.  See Figure Five for a small illustration.

      Our final topic for discussion this month will be several
methods for the convenient browsing of individual PTFs and their
cover letters.  Our methods will cover both PTFs that have already
been RECEIVED by SMP, and also PTFs that have not yet been RECEIVED.

      To browse PTFs and other SYSMODs that have been RECEIVED by
SMP, one need merely refer to the SMPPTS dataset, either for an SMP/E
system, or even for an old SMP4 system.  There is a handy TSO "browser"
command called "REVIEW", which does not need ISPF in order to work.
Two versions of REVIEW are found on the CBT tape.  The earlier version
is on File 296, and a later, improved version is on File 134 of any
recent level of that tape.  Either version can be employed in a simple
CLIST (Figure Six) that will accomplish the convenient "browse" of
a RECEIVED SYSMOD.

      Looking at a not-yet-RECEIVED SYSMOD is much trickier, because
such a SYSMOD is usually embedded in a large SMPPTFIN-format
sequential file that can contain several hundred thousand card-images
and hundreds of separate SYSMODs.  Anyone familiar with the usual
tools will know that such a file is hard or impossible to negotiate
with a "browsing" or "editing" tool.

      To chop this file into easy-to-find pieces, I have written
a quick-and-dirty COBOL program that works well.  The name of this
program is SMPUPD, and it can also be found on File 118 of the CBT
tape.

      The SMPUPD program essentially makes a duplicate temporary copy
of an SMPPTFIN-format file, but with two subtle changes.  First,
before any card-image beginning with ++PTF, ++APAR, ++USERMOD, or
++FUNCTION, a new IEBUPDTE-format card is inserted.  This card has the
format:

./  ADD NAME=sysmdnm       (sysmdnm is the number of the SYSMOD)

      The second change done to the copy of the original file, is
that any "./" string found in columns 1-2 of the original file, is
changed to a different string, "><".  The PDSLOAD program (CBT tape
File 316) or the IEBUPDTE program is then run against the new copy
of the original file, to break it up into partitioned dataset members.
An advantage of PDSLOAD over IEBUPDTE is that in the reloading
process, the embedded "><" strings can be reconverted back to the
original "./" strings, without having to run an additional utility
step.  See Figure Seven for a JCL example to illustrate how this
processing works in practice.  Partitioned dataset members consisting
of individual PTFs are much easier to browse (or edit) than large
sequential SMPPTFIN files.

      A final twist in the "partitioning" of an SMPPTFIN file is
provided by the "PDS program product" again (if it is at version 8.0
or higher, or if it is "PDS/E").  This is that product's ability to
add ISPF statistics to partitioned dataset members THROUGH A BATCH
JOB, and also ITS ABILITY TO RESTORE DELETED MEMBERS IN THAT SAME JOB
STEP.  See the bottom of Figure Seven.  Sometimes, duplicate PTFs can
be shipped by IBM in the same file.  This will cause one member to be
created by IEBUPDTE or PDSLOAD in the output partitioned dataset,
which will be deleted later when the second member of the same name
is stowed.  To remedy the loss caused by such deletion, the PDS(/E)
subcommand:

   RESTORE $PTF REPEAT NOPROMPT

will automatically resuscitate all deleted members, and supply these
with names $PTF0001, $PTF0002, etc. that will place them at the
beginning of a directory sort.

      See Figure Ten for a partial member list from such a
"partitionized" PTF file that was created from a PUT tape file.
It will quickly become clear how useful this sort of processing
is.

      Well that's it for now.  I hope this discussion will improve
the state of system maintenance in your shop in some way.  Actually,
I haven't spoken of all my ideas on this subject yet.  Maybe we can
deal with it some more next month.  Good luck.  See you again soon.

Figure Six.   A simple CLIST that allows a convenient browse of
               RECEIVED SYSMODs through the use of the REVIEW
               TSO command and the PDS command processor.
               Individual PTFs may be browsed, or a range of
               PTF numbers can be explored or examined.

Figure Seven.   SMPUPD Jobstream which breaks a PUT tape file into
                 a convenient-to-browse PDS.  Please note the step
                 at the end which runs the "PDS" command processor
                 under TSO-in-Batch.  The result achieved is that
                 the final partitioned dataset has ISPF statistics
                 and shows all duplicated PTFs from the input file.
                 All members are available for the user to look
                 at, or edit.

Figure Eight.   Member list of PTFs which have been separated out of
                 a large SMPPTFIN file (of over 156,000 card-images).
                 The result was achieved using my SMPUPD program.
                 This display happens to be a PDS/E member list
                 display.  The "public" PDS product has a similar
                 facility.
