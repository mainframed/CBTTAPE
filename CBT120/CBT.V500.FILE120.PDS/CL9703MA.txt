HARNESSING MACRO POWER - PART 1

      Early in my career, before I felt comfortable programming in
Assembler Language, I used to be very frustrated by some IBM
pronouncements, to the effect that they've provided a programming
interface to some system service, in the form of a macro.  "You can't
harness the macro unless you write a program", I used to moan to
myself.  Since I was then uncomfortable writing my own program, I
started looking around for someone else's program.  With access to the
CBT MVS Utilities Tape, a large free software collection that is now
orderable through NaSPA, I usually could find someone else's code
which took advantage of the service.  Then I could either use that
program as is, or tailor it for my own needs.

      This process is looked upon disdainfully by the old timers, who
would always try and write the complete code themselves.  I have a
different view, being of a little later vintage.  First, if you have
a working coded example, you don't have to repeat the little bugs
and mistakes yourself.  (This has the disadvantage, that you often
never discover what they were in the first place.)  Second, by
carefully studying the other person's work, you can quickly find out
how that macro interface can be used in a program, so you can easily
write your own similar programs later.  Third, you can save quite a
bit of debugging time, and get the code into production quickly.

      Today, we'll talk about a few useful examples of this process.
Hopefully, you'll get some good ideas, which you can then use in your
work.  A by-product of this study, is that you'll either find, or
develop, some helpful utility programs that will benefit your shop
and yourselves later.


A RACF EXAMPLE

      If your shop has a security package other than RACF, don't turn
yourself off at this point.  You can probably write a similar program
to fit the other security packages as well.  If you do write such a
program, the "whole world" will benefit if you'll send the code to the
proprietor of one of the free software collections, such as the CBT
Tape itself.  You may find out the address of the proprietor by calling
the NaSPA office.

      The problem is as follows:  A Systems Programmer would like to
interrogate RACF (in batch or TSO) to find out if a specific user has
access to a specific resource, and what that access is.  Sometimes
this information is not easily obtainable from RACF's ISPF interface.
For example we have the following case:  Our specific user is
connected to several groups, and each group has some level of access
to the resource.  It is not easy to know, from the RACF ISPF display
directly, what our specific user's actual maximum access level is.
Each of the groups might have a different access level to the
resource.  We want to know positively, and right now, the highest
level of access that our user has, to that resource.

      A related problem is familiar to EDP Auditors, but a Systems
Programmer might want to know this information as well.  We want to
know if a specific user has UPDATE access or higher, to any system
linklist libraries, LPA list libraries, or APF authorized libraries.
We can list out all such libraries in our system, and we want to query
the security package if our specific user has the power to update any
of them.  RACF's ISPF interface is almost helpless in this situation.

      There is a system macro interface provided by IBM, which can
give this information.  This is the RACHECK macro.  However, the
RACHECK macro is useless unless it is put into a program.  On the
CBT MVS Tape, File 106, there is a program which harnesses the power
of the RACHECK macro service, to easily give us the information we
want.

      How does the program (called RACCESS) work?  The program takes
card-image input for each security interrogation request.  Output is
sent to a normal print line.  Input is read and output is written via
simple QSAM GET and PUT.  In this simple application, the input cards
are not parsed, but the input has to be in fixed columns, and is broken
into fields.  Userid, resource class, and profile name are in fixed
fields, and once the input card is read, these fields are copied into
the appropriate input fields for the RACHECK macro.  See Figure 1 for
details on how the RACHECK macro is set up.  The outputs from the
RACHECK macro are formatted (eventually) into a print line.  There is
a little more to it.

      RACHECK is quite inflexible, so our program has to invoke it
repeatedly in the following way:  There are various "degrees of access"
possible within RACF.  No access to the resource is called "NONE".
Then, in increasing order, are READ, UPDATE, CONTROL, and finally
ALTER, which is full access for creating and deleting the resource.
An invocation of RACHECK has to specify exactly which degree of access
we are querying for.  Thus, our program first must invoke RACHECK to
check for ALTER access.  Then it must invoke RACHECK again (if ALTER
access is not granted), to see whether CONTROL access is granted.  If
CONTROL hasn't been granted, then another invocation of RACHECK
specifically asks if UPDATE is granted.  If UPDATE isn't there, then
another RACHECK is done for READ.  Finally, if READ isn't granted, NONE
is assumed and is reported.  With the first return of a "YES", an
appropriate output line is formatted and written.  See Figure 2 for
a sample input to and output from the RACCESS program.

      The main result we have here is a practical utility which takes
normal, easily controllable input, runs it into a macro service
facility, and formats convenient, readable output.  An assembler macro
service has thus been converted into a very usable tool.

      Just to complete the picture, I'd like to show how this utility
can be used to solve the EDP Auditor problem mentioned above.  We
want to show if a particular userid has UPDATE or higher access to
linklist, LPA list, and APF authorized libraries.  We can copy the
LNKLSTxx, LPALSTxx and PROGxx members of SYS1.PARMLIB to our own card
image dataset, and edit them to create a combined list of dataset names,
starting in column 17 of the cards.  Then, columns 1 to 8 can be filled
in (left justified and padded with blanks) with the USERID name to be
tested.  Columns 9 to 16 can be filled in with the resource class name
of "DATASET".  Thus, the input deck of cards is complete.  This deck
is run into our program, and a corresponding output list is produced,
which gives the actual level of access that the user has, to each
library.  If any of these accesses are UPDATE, CONTROL, or ALTER,
these can be easily spotted in the program's print output.  To check a
different USERID, just do a global change for column 1 in the entire
input deck.  The problem has been solved.

      File 106 from the CBT Tape includes a member which is a sample
CLIST to invoke the RACCESS program in the foreground.  Output is
displayed on the screen, from an input card-image deck in a dataset.
Since the RACCESS program produces conventional QSAM SYSPRINT output,
there is no trouble displaying this when the program is invoked in the
foreground under TSO.

      One further note.  Under some conditions, for example if the RACF
Audit option is turned on for datasets, running the RACCESS program
with its many invocations of the RACHECK macro, can produce unwanted
RACF console messages and SMF Type 80 Records for each RACHECK
invocation.  This can be gotten around by coding the LOG=NONE parameter
in the RACHECK macro, and running the program authorized.  To do so,
the RACCESS program has to be linkedited with SETCODE AC(1) and run out
of an authorized library.  Most Systems Programmers have the facilities
to run their own authorized programs.


A TSO EXAMPLE

      In the newer "TSO/E Customization" manuals, an IBM macro
service is described, which interfaces with the USERID records of
the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset.  The macro is called IKJIFRIF, and you
have to write a program in the form of a TSO Command Processor, to
use the service.  I'll show you what the service is for, and how I
easily wrote a simple TSO Command program to interface to it.

      The SYS1.BRODCAST dataset performs a service for TSO users at
an installation.  This is to hold system messages that are destined to
be sent to a certain TSO user, so that the messages can be displayed
when that user logs on to TSO later.  The TSO SEND or Operator SEND
commands are used to create the messages.  If the user is currently
logged on, then the message is sent directly to that user's terminal.
If the user is not logged on, then the message is written to a record
in the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset, and chained to that user's string of
pending message records.  The beginning and end of this chain is
pointed to by a USERID record in the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset.  (We are
assuming that individual TSO Userlogs are not being used.)  When the
TSO user logs on, LOGON processing invokes the LISTBC program, which
displays the user's messages at the terminal, and deletes all messages
on the user's chain.  If the user never logs on, all of the messages in
that user's chain are piled up, and the chain grows longer and longer
as more messages are sent to that user.  Suppose a user leaves the
company.  Then if production job messages continue to be sent to that
user, it is possible for the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset, being a direct
access, formatted dataset, to fill up.

      IBM does not provide a means of displaying and deleting a
different user's SYS1.BRODCAST messages.  You can only delete your
own.  However, IBM does provide the IKJIFRIF macro interface to delete
that user's USERID record and all the attached messages.  The IKJIFRIF
macro can also be used to add a new USERID record to the SYS1.BRODCAST
dataset, so that after the particular userid and its messages have
been deleted from SYS1.BRODCAST, the same userid can be reinstated
later, with none of the old messages attached to it.  This can be used
as one means of clearing an arbitrary user's unwanted messages out of
SYS1.BRODCAST.  The only obstacle is that a program must be written to
harness the power of the IKJIFRIF macro.

      In the TSO/E Customization manual, the usage of the IKJIFRIF
macro is explained.  You have to invoke the macro as part of a TSO
Command Processor program that has a parsing facility for a parameter.
TSO Command Processors are programs that are designed to run under TSO
as a command.  A TSO Command Processor program assumes that Register 1
points to a control block called the CPPL, or Command Processor
Parameter List.  The CPPL is filled in when the program is invoked
under TSO as a command.  Thus, the 4 fullwords of the CPPL, which point
to the "command buffer" and 3 TSO control blocks, have to be accessible
to our program.  In other words, a program which invokes IKJIFRIF has
to start by copying all four data area pointers to program storage.

      In order for IKJIFRIF to be invoked, you then have to tell
IKJIFRIF where to find the 3 TSO control blocks, whose pointers you got
from the CPPL.  Then you tell IKJIFRIF if you want to ADD or DELETE a
userid record in SYS1.BRODCAST.  Finally, the TSO command has to parse
the command buffer somehow, to retrieve the name of a userid to tell
IKJIFRIF which name to work with.  I have coded such programs, which
are part of my SYS1.BRODCAST handling package that is on File 247 of
the CBT Tape.  They are called BCMUSADD for adding a userid record, and
BCMUSDEL for deleting a userid record.  All they do is take a TSO
Command Processor shell, and "wrap it around" an invocation of the
IKJIFRIF macro, to ADD or DELETE the particular userid record which was
specified by the command parm.  IKJIFRIF does the rest.  It is really
very simple.  For an example of invoking IKJIFRIF, see Figure 3.

      I hope that I have whetted your appetite to look for other
macros to make utilities out of.  Any macro which takes some input,
and which invokes a service to return a result, is a candidate for
such treatment.  Next time, I hope to elaborate on more details of
carrying out this process.  Meanwhile, good luck and good hunting.

            of the VOLSER name) of an invocation of the LOCATE macro
            within the program.  ALTER is hard-coded.  With other
            invocations of RACHECK in this program, CONTROL, UPDATE, or
            READ are hard-coded instead of ALTER, in the ATTR keyword.
