YOUR TSO SESSION - USING THE PSCB

      Oftentimes a simple control block exerts a very powerful
influence on how a program runs.  In the case of your TSO session,
some of the PSCB (Protected Step Control Block) fields will have a
very crucial effect on what the session can do.  It is my feeling that
a systems programmer, who works under TSO all day, will profit greatly
from having an enhanced understanding of what the PSCB controls.
Control of the OPER, MOUNT, JCL, and ACCOUNT attributes of your TSO
session will help you accomplish many system tasks better.

      The macro IKJPSCB in SYS1.MACLIB, which maps the PSCB,
describes the PSCB as a control block used to maintain user
attributes and accounting data on a userid basis.  The PSCB is
established at LOGON time, it is unique for each TSO session, and it
is userid oriented.  Obviously, this control block plays a big part
in determining the kind of power your TSO session will have.

      Bill Godfrey, a pioneer system software writer, wrote two TSO
commands which allow a systems programmer to make best use of practical
PSCB knowledge.  These commands are LPSCB (list the PSCB) and CPSCB
(change the PSCB).  Obviously LPSCB, which does not do any
alterations, can be made available to more users than CPSCB, which
must run authorized, and which should be restricted to systems
personnel only.  Today, we will learn to use both of these commands
profitably, to help us exploit the power of the PSCB control block.

      Of course, if you want to try this software yourself, you have
to know where to obtain it.  Both the LPSCB and CPSCB TSO commands can
be found in source form on File 300 of the CBT MVS Utilities tape.
The CBT Tape contains a world of useful software for MVS, and can be
ordered through NaSPA.


SOME PSCB EXAMPLES.

      Last month, we talked about using the REVIEW command to look at
tape files, the same way you can use it to look at disk files.  This
power is greatly facilitated if your TSO session possesses the MOUNT
attribute.  Many people are of the opinion that the MOUNT attribute
should not be on by default, even for systems programmers, because you
may inadvertently interfere with tape operation from your TSO session.
The most desirable scenario would be to turn MOUNT on only when you
need it, keeping it off the rest of the time.

      Now, since the presence or absence of the MOUNT attribute is
determined by the PSCB, you can therefore turn MOUNT on or off if you
can change the appropriate bit in the PSCB for your session.  At this
point, one might ask the question:  "Doesn't the security system (e.g.
RACF) set this attribute?"  The answer seems to be that RACF plays a
part in initializing the PSCB with its session attributes during TSO
LOGON processsing.  However, once the session is active, TSO looks
only at the PSCB to determine these session attributes.  RACF is
involved only at the beginning.  Therefore, RACF will not interfere
with what we want to do.

      So practically, if it is possible for you to install and
authorize Bill Godfrey's CPSCB command for yourself, you can now enter
a TSO command, "CPSCB MOUNT" or "CPSCB NOMOUNT" to toggle the MOUNT
attribute on and off when you need it.  To check on the current state
of your session, you can use Bill Godfrey's "LPSCB" command to display
whether the MOUNT attribute is currently on or off.

      Thus, if you'd want to use the REVIEW command (CBT MVS Tape -
File 134) to browse a cataloged tape file and the MOUNT attribute is
on, the TSO command "REVIEW tape.dsname" will cause a console tape
mount message to be issued for operator response.  The console
message will ask the operator to mount the appropriate tape.  If the
MOUNT attribute is off, the TSO user will get an error message and no
tape action will occur.

      Here's another example (for strict systems use only).  Suppose
your TSO broadcast dataset is full and the "BRODSCAN" batch program
(CBT Tape Files 136, 437, 453) has been used to determine what filled
it up.  Your decision is that you want to clear the SYS1.BRODCAST
dataset.  However, there is the slight drawback that your TSO session
does not have the ACCOUNT attribute.  This can be discovered by using
LPSCB, or by trying to execute IBM's "ACCOUNT" command and finding
that it doesn't work.  If CPSCB is installed and authorized, the
command "CPSCB ACCOUNT" will remedy that situation.  The command
"CPSCB NOACCOUNT" could be used later to turn the ACCOUNT attribute
back off.  You can use LPSCB to check if CPSCB worked.  Once the
ACCOUNT attribute is on for your TSO session, you can use the
"ACCOUNT" TSO command from IBM, and issue its SYNC subcommand to clear
the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset of extraneous messages.

      Obviously, you'll want to be very careful to restrict these
facilities to the smallest group possible.  But as "system doctors",
you'll find them to be extremely handy in your own work.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

      Figures 1 through 4 will help round out your practical knowledge
on this subject, and will help show you where to look further.  Figure
1 displays the output of the LPSCB command in its detail.  The session
shown has a lot of power, since most of the available attributes are
turned on.  It is instructive to compare the output of LPSCB with the
IKJPSCB macro from SYS1.MACLIB, part of which is shown in Figure 3.
You can, of course, see the full macro IKJPSCB by looking at it in
SYS1.MACLIB on your own system.  Figure 2 shows the TSO HELP member
for LPSCB, and Figure 4 shows how to use the CPSCB command.

      I mentioned the subject of "personal" TSO authorization in a
previous column (February 1993).  All of my previous columns can be
found on File 120 of the CBT Tape, so if you have a fairly new tape,
you don't have to download the column from NasCOM.  If you have access
to the abovementioned "fairly new" CBT Tape, Files 185 and 186 will be
especially helpful on this subject, and they will save you a lot of
work.

      A useful manual describing TSO control blocks is:  "A Guide to
Writing a TMP or Command Processor" for older versions of TSO, or its
successor, "TSO/E Version 2 Programming Services".  Also, "TSO/E
Version 2 Customization" will be helpful.  "TSO Command Processor"
programming examples abound all over the CBT Tape.  Notable files to
scan are:  File 423 from my own TSO teacher, Jeff Broido, and the huge
collection, File 300 from Jim Marshall.

      All this should serve as a haphazard introduction to the
world of TSO in general, and as a practical aid to getting past
some obstacles in your systems programming work.  In any case, the
path for learning is now open.  You can walk on it if you wish.

      Good luck.  See you next month.

            In my opinion, the most frequently used part of this

Figure 4.   Syntax of the CPSCB TSO command.


      Once the CPSCB command is installed and authorized, it refers
      to the TSO session attributes as shown by the LPSCB command
      in Figure 1.  Thus, to turn on/off attributes, you do the
      following:


            CPSCB   (OPER|NOOPER)
                    (ACCOUNT|NOACCOUNT)
                    (JCL|NOJCL)
                    (MOUNT|NOMOUNT)
