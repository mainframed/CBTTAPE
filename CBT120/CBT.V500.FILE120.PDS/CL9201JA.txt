ABOUT DATASET BLOCK SIZES AND I/O EFFICIENCY - PART II.

      This issue marks the beginning of this column's fourth year.
Time flies, when you enjoy your work!

      Last month, we began to speak about the need for I/O efficiency
to and from disk storage.  Although it is important to pack as much
data as possible into a track of disk space, it is probably a good
deal more important to write and retrieve that data quickly.  An
analysis of the workload at most shops will probably show that
throughput--getting the jobs done quickly--is the highest priority
aim.

      My friend Rick Fochtman has done a lot of study directed at
increasing job throughput.  Rick contends that I/O bottlenecks are a
great part of the performance problems in most places.  One outgrowth
of Rick's studies, is the rather startling result that certain
prevalent block sizing practices can significantly hurt I/O rates
to and from disk storage.

      I hope to explain some of Rick's contentions as we go on.
We'll talk about the channel programs associated with disk I/O,
and how to reduce various sources of wasted time.

      Rick has stated, that on a very busy system, datasets with
one-fifth track blocking (five blocks per track) could have I/O
rates 2 1/2 or 3 times more efficient than with half-track blocking.
As we showed last month (see Figure 1), track utilization at 5 blocks
per track on 3380's and 3390's is just a bit less than space usage at
2 blocks per track.  That slight space loss will be greatly offset by
the increased I/O speed to and from the data.

      Rick adds the caveat that he has not studied DASD with cache
controllers, but there is still a lot of DASD without cache
controllers out there.  For the latter, Rick feels he can vouch for
these results.


CHANNEL PROGRAMS IN DATA MANAGEMENT AND IN IOS.

      IOS, the "Input-Output Subsystem", is a part of the base MVS
product.  IOS does device-specific handling of I/O requests.  IOS can
be pictured as as the "lowest level" of I/O software in MVS.

      The more familiar "READS" and "WRITES" to disk that are done by
most programmers, are part of the "data management" packages (nowadays
called "DFP" or "Data Facility Product"), which are an add-on to the
base MVS product.  The data management "access methods", which handle
the "reads and writes", are a higher-level and more device-independent
programmer interface.  "Access Methods" are part of DFP.

      What happens when you do a sequential READ or a WRITE, using
an access method (except for BSAM, where the programmer has complete
control)?  Almost always, the system tries to fill 5 buffers at once.
This number 5 was decided upon by the data management architects some
years ago as optimal for internal design reasons.  When the BUFNO
parameter is not stated on a DD card, "BUFNO=5" is usually the
default.

      In order to fill these buffers, the system must get the data.
It does so using "channel programs", which instruct those I/O
hardware devices loosely known as "channels".  The "channels" do
the actual I/O to and from the devices, independently of the CPU.

      Instructions in channel programs are called "CCWs", or
"Channel Command Words".  We shall assume (for those who are
familiar) that our discussion will concern only "Format-0 CCWs",
that are essentially unchanged for 25 years.  There are various types
of these CCWs.  We shall discuss what happens when we want to read
some records on disk storage using "QSAM" (Queued Sequential Access
Method).

      When we issue a GET for the data, QSAM constructs a channel
program consisting of 3 instructions.  These are:

      "Search ID=" (a search for particular CCHHR disk data within
boundaries), TIC (an unconditional "goto") back to the "search id="
instruction and finally (if the search was successful) the next
sequential CCW (the TIC) is bypassed.  This results in the execution
of the third instruction, a "Read CKD" (or "Read Count-Key-Data")
which gets the data.

      If both BUFNO greater than 1, and NCP greater than 1 are
specified, then the channel program is extended to read that number
of records (the minimum of these two numbers) without additional
seek overhead.  However, this is limited by space allocation unit
(TRK or CYL) boundaries.  (BLKs are rounded to tracks.)

      The access method (QSAM) passes this channel program down to
IOS, which adds two instructions to the front of it, and sometimes
a third.  These are:

      A "standalone SEEK" for the desired CCHHR, to get the heads
moving to the right cylinder.  This is followed by a "CCW Set File
Mask", which sets limits on allowing a change of track or cylinder.
You want to remain in the bounds of your dataset allocation during the
subsequent reading of the data.  The hardware helps you do this.

      So the program which goes to the device actually consists of
five instructions:  standalone seek, CCW set file mask, search id=,
TIC back to the search, and finally Read CKD.

      A significant time-consumer here is the standalone seek.
Any means of decreasing the number of seeks is probably good for
throughput.  A second potential time-waster has to do with disk
rotation delays.  We'll talk about that shortly.  Our third time-
gobbler is eliminated by 5-block per track blocking.  Simply put,
it's THE PREVENTION OF BREAKS IN THE CHANNEL PROGRAM.

      Remember that the access methods will try to fill five buffers
at one time.  They do this for their own internal efficiency (so it
doesn't pay to set BUFNO=2 for every DD card in your shop.  The
"access method" people have thought of that already.)  The five
buffers will get filled smoothly, provided that the CCW "set file
mask" instruction doesn't detect a bad data boundary, such as the
end of a track or the end of a cylinder.  If track or cylinder
boundary does get hit, IOS will construct a new channel program and
start it automatically, but with the penalty of a big time delay and
many extra "searches".

      Now just think.  Under half-track blocking, reading 5 blocks
crosses two track boundaries.  This results in two channel program
breaks and restarts, forcing lots of extra "searches".  Under
"5-blocks per track" blocking, reading 5 blocks results in no
channel program break at all.  The channel program just starts at
the beginning of the track, reads the entire track and fills the
buffers.  There are no channel program break delays introduced.
That's where you get the huge savings, especially while using TRK
allocation that forces an program break at every track boundary.

      This idea is worth investigation and implementation.

      With that explained, let's conclude this month's installment
with a discussion of disk rotation delays.


DEVICES EQUIPPED WITH ROTATIONAL POSITION SENSING (RPS).

      Our discussion of "disk rotation delays" is really a misnomer.
The major concern here is the prevention of "channel-busy" tie-ups
during disk rotation.

      If a disk device has to interrupt an I/O because it is waiting
for a particular record to rotate under its heads, the least it can
do is free the connecting channel to do other work during the
rotational delay.  Devices having the "RPS" feature do just this.
They free the connecting channel while they are rotating toward
a record.  Both 3380 and 3390 disk devices have the RPS feature.

      From our point of reference, how does this feature work?

      If the access method (DFP) knows that it's going to an
RPS-equipped device, it issues a "set sector" CCW instruction
before the "search id=" CCW instruction.  This "set sector"
instruction operates in the hardware, between the channel and
the device.  The idea is that the hardware will determine when
the required record is underneath its heads, and only then will
it try to connect the channel to the device.  If the channel is
busy, the device will have to do one more rotation.  Otherwise,
a free channel will be connected to the device and will retrieve
the record.

      There are many implications to this.  A full disk rotation
is on the order of 14-17 milliseconds.  That's a long time to
tie up a channel connected to half a dozen devices, all trying
to do their own I/O's.

      Speaking about channel tie-ups, we'll talk about key searches
next month, when we conclude this series.  Key searches tie up the
channel while they're occurring.  ISAM does a lot of key searches.
BLDL does a lot of key searches.  Program operations that involve
key searches can cause I/O bottlenecks, principally because of
channel tie-ups.  We'll see how, next time.

      Meanwhile, we've got plenty to chew on.  Good luck in all
your work.  See you next month.

FIGURE 1.      This is a display of track capacities for 3380 and
                3390 disk devices.  The display was produced by
                the BLKDISK command from File 296 of the CBT MVS
                Utilities Tape.  The numbers shown are the largest
                blocksizes possible, to be able to fit "N" blocks
                into a track.  A 3380 device can hold 47476 bytes
                in one track, but two blocks on the same track
                would require an "inter-block spacing".  Three
                blocks would require two spacings, and so on.
                This chart shows the extent of "spacing losses"
                for each device.  For both devices, 5 blocks/track
                is not very much worse than 2 blocks/track.  An
                additional 3 spacings on a large track isn't too
                much, percentage wise.
