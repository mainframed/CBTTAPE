ON DATASET RECOVERY  -  INTRODUCTION

      We systems programmers are sometimes confronted with a situation
where a previously good dataset has gotten broken.  It becomes our job
to create some sort of recovery.  Either the objective is to restore
from a backup copy, fix the dataset, or short of that, we'd like to
recover as much useful data as possible.

      Of course, every situation is different, but the cases do fall
into certain known categories much of the time.  This month, our
concentration will be on introducing the tools needed to fix non-VSAM
datasets.  As we shall eventually see, there are enough of those types
of problems to keep us quite busy studying.

      Next time, we'll talk specifically about broken PDS'es
(partitioned datasets) and broken sequential datasets.  And we'll try
to develop an organized approach to fixing them.  Today, we'll
introduce the basis for that discussion.


GETTING STARTED WITH BROKEN DATASETS

      When a dataset has something wrong with it, where do you start?
Although I have my own experience, I often ask for a second opinion, and
I asked my friend Rick Fochtman what he thought on this subject.  He
told me three questions he always asks.  They are:  "What does it look
like?"  "How bad is it?"  "What can we do?"  There is a lot of depth to
Rick's approach, which seems more simple than it actually is.  Let's
look at these three questions in the context of a real problem.

      "What does it look like?"  The first aspect of diagnosing a
broken dataset is to form a picture in your mind of the "shape" of the
dataset and the place where it seems to be broken.  For example, if a
disk sequential dataset has an I/O error somewhere in the middle, you
can picture a long row of data blocks containing records.  Each data
block has its own TTR (relative location from the beginning of the
dataset by Track and Record Count).  Then you can superimpose some
damaged TTR locations into that picture.  This will give you a mental
image of the problem situation to start with.  There are "good" TTR
locations before the damaged place, and there are good records
afterwards.  In this simple situation, we have answered the first
question by creating an initial mental picture.  In a real problem, we
would probably have to continually refine this picture as new evidence
accumulates.

      "How bad is it?"  Let's go back to our simple example.  We can
ask:  Is there only one I/O error, or are there several?  Does the
dataset have a proper EOF marker?  Do we have a backup from before?
How current is the backup--will several days' work be lost if we
restore from the backup?  Is the disk location of the error in a place
where there is old data, or is the error in a place containing new data
from after the backup was taken?  All these questions and more, have to
be asked before we go the the third step, which is deciding what we can
do toward a remedy.

      "What can we do?"  Here, we have to make some decisions, use
some ingenuity, and marshal whatever tools are needed.  The safest
alternative is usually to try and restore the dataset from a backup
copy.  If that option is not open, either because no backup exists, or
the data has changed too much since the backup was taken, then we
might try to create another disk copy of the bad dataset which
contains as much "good data" as we can recover.  Finally, if this is
possible, we have to find a way of getting the good data copied into
the new dataset, in such a way as to allow the data to be usable.  For
all that, we need one or more tools.  Sometimes, especially when there
is corrupted data, there is a DCB blocksize problem.  Such "details"
must also be handled.

  as they have technical connotations.  Thanks. )


TOOLS TO USE

      I am an advocate of the "whatever works" approach.  When dealing
with bad non-VSAM datasets, we will need a means of changing VTOC
entries, especially FORMAT 1 entries.  We will need a means of dumping
or looking at bad data and good data.  Finally, we will have to be
able to copy good records from a damaged dataset to the "recovery"
dataset.  When dealing with partitioned datasets, we will need a means
of restoring directory entries for "deleted" members.  This is even
more necessary when a PDS directory has been ruined, or it has been
overlaid by sequential data.  In that case, all of the old directory
entries may have to be reconstructed.

      IBM has given us many of these tools.  However, some of my
favorite ones are not from IBM.  That is because these non-IBM tools
are often easier to use, leave less room for user error, and you can
see what you're doing better.  I will not write here about any tools
that your shop has to buy.  The non-IBM tools mentioned here are all
obtainable from the CBT MVS Utilities tape that can be ordered from
NaSPA.  The CBT Tape may be freely copied, but it is frequently
updated, so it pays to get a new one every so often.

      What are some IBM tools available?  There is one that we'll
always have to use.  That one is ICKDSF, which we'll need to convert
indexed VTOCs to OSVTOC format, so we can zap the VTOCs effectively.
After our manipulations to the VTOC in OSVTOC format, ICKDSF is used
again to convert the volume back to using the VTOC index.  A bit more
cleverness may be required if the volume is SMS managed and can't be
easily un-indexed.  See Figure 2 for JCL to un-index and re-index a
disk volume.

      For looking at VTOCs, you can use IEHLIST with LISTVTOC DUMP.
This will produce a CCHHR dump of all VTOC records.  Then, to change
them, you can use AMASPZAP (IBM's superzap) with its CCHHR control
cards to do the VER's and the REP's.  The dataset name will be
"FORMAT4.DSCB", pointing to the unit and the volume serial.  As
awkward as this is, this technique with IBM utilities is very powerful
and far reaching.  A variation of it can even be used to make small
adjustments to PDS directory entries, using different control cards
for IEHLIST.  However, user-friendliness is non-existent with this
method.  You have to thoroughly know what you are doing.  To find out
more about these IBM tools, look in the "Service Aids" manual and the
"DFP Utilities" manual for almost any level of the MVS operating
system.

      The "IBM approach" cannot be used without further knowledge of
the layout of FORMAT 1 VTOC entries, and possibly, the knowledge of PDS
directory entries.  I am a strong advocate of using system macros from
SYS1.MODGEN (or AMODGEN) and SYS1.MACLIB, along with the "Data Areas"
manuals.  The system macro IECSDSL1 from SYS1.AMODGEN will show the
layout of all VTOC formats.  See Figure 1 for how to use this macro.
The IBM macro IHAPDS, also in SYS1.AMODGEN, will help you to recognize
PDS directory entry fields.  The layouts of PDS directory entries have
been discussed in previous columns of mine (September thru November
1991).  All of my previous columns are found on File 120 of the CBT
MVS Tape, so you don't need back copies of this magazine.

      Non-IBM tools from the CBT MVS Tape are:  (fullscreen) ZAP and
REVIEW TSO commands from File 134, the CDSCB (change the DSCB) TSO
command from File 300, and the "PDS" TSO command Version 8.4 from File
182.  We'll elaborate on these four TSO commands shortly.  The IEHMAP
batch program on File 083 of the CBT Tape will produce a track map of
an entire volume.  IEHMAP conveniently supplies CCHHR values for the
beginning and end of all dataset extents on a disk pack, which will
greatly aid us in the VTOC zapping we'll have to do.  These five
non-IBM tools should cover us for the rest of this month's talk.

 (Editors:  Please respect the selection of caps in the above
  paragraph.  Thanks. )

      The ZAP command, with keywords 'FORMAT4.DSCB' and VOL(volser) will
allow you to look at and change VTOC entries on the screen.  ZAP should
be carefully restricted to systems personnel only, but we're fixing
broken datasets here, and we'll need it.  REVIEW is a full screen browse
program with enormous power.  Using REVIEW's NEWTOP subcommand, you can
position the logical "top of data" just previous to an I/O error, or
just subsequent to one.  The newest versions of REVIEW (after version
379 of the CBT Tape) have CUT and ADD subcommands to copy records from
data being looked at, to another dataset.  This allows for recovery of
sequential data records before and after an I/O error.

      The CDSCB command, which has to run authorized, allows the user
to change DCB attributes of a dataset without having to know the exact
layout of the FORMAT 1 VTOC entry.  See Figure 3 for more information.
Finally, the PDS command (Version 8.4) is a multi-purpose dataset
utility that can be used to easily dump the FORMAT 1 DSCB layout of a
dataset (using its "USAGE ALL" subcommand).  "PDS" (with its RESTORE
subcommand) can be used to "undelete" pds members, while with its
DIRENTRY and ATTRIB subcommands, "PDS" can be used to view and change
directory entry fields.  I do not recommend using PDS's FIXPDS
subcommand to change the DCB attributes of a broken dataset.  This is
because the FIXPDS DCB manipulations open the dataset for output, and
they could ruin the setting of DS1LSTAR (the dataset high-water mark
in the FORMAT 1 DSCB).  Rather use CDSCB, which only opens and changes
the FORMAT 1 VTOC entry itself.  With CDSCB, the data in the dataset
is not altered at all; only the VTOC entry for the dataset is altered.


EXAMPLES.

      We've used most of our space for this month, and I'll have to
be brief here.  We'll continue and elaborate on this phase next time.

      Let's see what to do about the sequential dataset with one I/O
error in the middle, assuming we can't use a tape backup of the volume.
One way to recover is to REVIEW the dataset from the top, and find the
location of the I/O error by issuing a FIND subcommand in REVIEW for a
non-existent string.  This will force REVIEW to search through all the
data until it hits the I/O error.  When you hit the I/O error, back up
20 records or so, and go DOWN one record at a time.  The exact record
count until the error position will be apparent.  Mark this count down.
Then allocate a duplicate copy of the dataset to ddname SYSUT2.  Go to
the top of the data, and CUT the required number of records.  This will
copy those records to the beginning of the SYSUT2 dataset.

      Then NEWTOP to a CCHHR considerably past the I/O error where you
already have good data again.  Slowly NEWTOP back, one block at a time,
until you hit bad data.  NEWTOP to the first block of good data, and
ADD a large number of records, so that you copy the rest of the records,
with DISP=MOD effectively, to the end of the SYSUT2 dataset.  That's
it folks.  You've recovered most, or all, of the good records.

      Another approach would be to allocate a new dataset with the same
DCB attributes as the old dataset.  Then, with the VTOC un-indexed,
ZAP the two FORMAT 1 DSCB entries so that the CCHHR extents of the
original dataset only go up to the I/O error, and the other dataset
continues from after the end of the I/O error to the end of the original
dataset's extents.  Thus we have two datasets, which together, contain
recoverable data.

      You get the general idea.  Next time, we'll talk about specific
cases more.  This kind of work helps you "feel like you are earning
your pay as a systems programmer".  Good luck and good zapping (only
if necessary).  See you next month.

Figure 1.   How to obtain the layout of all VTOC record formats.  Each
            entry in a VTOC is called a DSCB (Dataset Control Block).
            The Format 1 DSCB provides most (or all) of the information
            connected with individual datasets.  If the dataset has more
            than 3 extents, you will also need a Format 3 DSCB entry.

Figure 2.   Jobs to un-index the VTOC and re-index the VTOC of a pack.
            It is assumed that the pack was originally indexed, and we
            do not want to use the index dataset while zapping VTOC
            entries.  When the VTOC is un-indexed, only the VTOC itself
            has meaningful information about the datasets on a pack.
            The index is then not used.  Re-indexing the pack will have
            the effect of reorganizing the VTOC index and recalculating
            the pack's free space.  To recalculate the free space of
            an OSVTOC volume, you have to turn on the "DIRF" bit of the
            FORMAT 4 DSCB, allocate a dummy dataset on the volume, and
            later delete the dummy dataset to clean up.
