"SHOW ME MVS" IN ONE PLACE.

      Before speaking about our main topic, I'd like to start this
month's article by recommending two books.  It is our purpose here, to
advance the skill levels of all practitioners of our trade.  Until
recently, assembler coding and knowledge of the innards of MVS were
solely the hard-won fruits of our efforts on the job.  In most parts
of the country, there wasn't a school to go to, to learn the nitty
gritty of this work.  However, there has existed a school for many
years, the Information Technology Institute of the New York University
School for Continuing Education, which has taught many courses
catering to our knowledge needs.  Many highly successful systems
programmers and software developers in the New York area and elsewhere
have profited through this school's offerings.

      There have now arisen some fruits of this school which can
greatly benefit all systems programmers everywhere.  These are in the
form of two books, which originally were outgrowths of NYU Information
Technology Institute courses.  These books are so valuable and so
concentrated, that they knock my socks off.  One of my own primary
wishes is to know and be able to use all the material in both of them.

      The books are:  "Advanced Assembler Language and MVS Interfaces"
by Carmine Cannatello, published by John Wiley, and "MVS Power
Programming" by Mitchell Marx and Penelope Davis, published by McGraw
Hill.  Let me briefly give you my impressions of both books before
dealing with the topic at hand for this month.

      Carmine's book is a wealth.  Splendidly organized and enormously
rich in facts, it must be characterized as a primary source for a
system programmer's apprenticeship and continuing growth over the years.
Coding examples abound, and the author systematically explains methods
of reaching many parts of the MVS operating system.  This knowledge is
normally acquired in a more haphazard manner by most of us, and many
of these techniques, though essential to our trade, are never acquired.
Nobody ever wrote about them before for the public, outside of manuals.
If you want one place to systematically march through the maze of MVS
techniques, and you're willing to put in the work, this is the place.

      Mitch and Penelope's book complements Carmine's.  More
recently written, "MVS Power Programming" is thoroughly pervaded by
ESA coding techniques.  In this book, the MVS Operating System is
explained completely from the ESA point of view, taking advantage of
all the new features.  The new assembler instructions and hardware
concepts are completely integrated into this thorough and systematic
walkthrough of deep MVS concepts.  Even seasoned old pros can
greatly profit from "MVS Power Programming", together with all of us
beginner and intermediate people.

      Both books have optional diskettes available, containing
machine readable copies of all the coding examples.  Now that you've
found out about these marvelous sources of our basic knowledge, you
can't afford, for your own professional standing, to do without them.
For those of you within reach of New York, the Information Technology
Institute of the NYU School of Continuing Education can be contacted

SHOW ME MVS.

      Our current topic is based on a fascinatingly simple concept.
Suppose I want to see everything about my MVS system and TSO session
in one place.  Can I?

      The answer is, that it's getting pretty nearly possible.  A
very clever offering in the form of a TSO command, has appeared on
the CBT Tape File 183.  This command is called "SHOWMVS".

      Its contributor is a good friend of mine, who is a consultant
specializing in VSE to MVS conversions.  My friend tells me that he
wants everything to be in one place.  He can't stand hunting around
with many commands for a half hour to find out what he wants to know.
SHOWMVS doesn't have any parameters; it always shows everything.  And
there are only two ways to invoke it.  Entering "TSO SHOWMVS" from an
ISPF session will produce (on my system) about 1400 lines of BROWSEd
output.  Pre-allocating a file using a ddname of SHOWMVS with a record
format of FBA and an LRECL of at least 101 will cause the output of
this TSO command to be written to that external file.

      What does SHOWMVS produce?  A lot.  For starters, see Figure 1,
which shows the first page of its output.  There are tons of essential
facts about your system shown just in the first page.  I'll detail
these a bit later.  After the first page, in addition, you get a
Virtual Storage Map, SRM Data, display of open catalogs, all your page
datasets and dump datasets, the full subsystem vector table with all
used program numbers, the linklist, the LPA list, the APF list, the
active LPA queue (ALPA), the SVC table with all its extended routers,
and a display of all online devices with SMS data if applicable.
That's the system-wide stuff.  For your own TSO session, there's
the TIOT (all your allocated ddnames), your TCB tree and RB chains,
the job pack queue (JPAQ), and the Load List off of each of your
TCB's.  This is quite a mouthful.  My friend told me that he's added a
few more things for his next release.  I just got it yesterday.  He's
put in extent information on all the linklist libraries, and he's
listed all the esoteric and generic names of the units on your system,
together with unit counts.  The entire report has been tastefully
lower-cased.

      The response for SHOWMVS seems very fast, considering that a lot
of catalog lookups have to be done.  APF libraries are marked if they
are not cataloged, and there is other similar information elsewhere in
the output that would seem to take more time.  This result is achieved
through a trick.  The top of the output is produced right away, while
a subtask is created to complete the gaps in the report while you're
browsing the first page.  Clever.

      For the rest of this article, I want to slow down and explain
the significance of what we've got here.  If you want to maximize your
profit from this product, you'll use SHOWMVS at your work every day,
early and often.


WHY WE CAN PROFIT BY RUNNING SHOWMVS FREQUENTLY.

      SHOWMVS tells you, right up front, many kinds of things we
usually ask about anyone's system.  SHOWMVS also appears to run very
fast, as I've mentioned.  If you are using its ISPF BROWSE display,
the top information will all appear probably in a second or two.
Writing the output to a pre-allocated dataset is slower because the
subtask needs time to complete, but it is still very quick for the
results you get.  Even though the output is many hundreds of lines,
the information that's up front, shown in Figure 1, is the type of
information you might want to see several times in the course of a
day's work.

      Most of the first page is system-level stuff, but there's a lot
of it.  It's too much to absorb all at once, so you might want to repeat
running SHOWMVS, so you can focus on different parts of its output at
different times.

      I'll list most of the items in the first page of the SHOWMVS
display, so you can get an idea of its richness.  At the beginning,
you get the operating system level, the DFP level, the JES2 level if
you have JES2, and the name of your NJE node.  Then you get a lot of
information about your last IPL.  Added to that knowledge is a
display of your CVTUSER field, to see if CVTUSER was used by some
product or add-on to your system.  It is important to be careful that
you not try to use CVTUSER twice, without planning for a
circumvention of the conflict.

      Added to this initial system display is a software display
that shows the TSO/E level, the ISPF level, the level of DFDSS if
you're running that product, the DFHSM level if you've got that, the
RACF level if you're running RACF, the VTAM level, and the DB2 level
if your site is running DB2.  Different sites may use different SORT
products.  SHOWMVS displays the eyecatchers of your SORT load module
so you know beyond any doubt, which brand of SORT your machine is
running.

      There follows a complete display of your SMF datasets and their
current state of use.  Along with that is your SMF system id, plus the
currently active setting of your system's SMF job wait time (JWT).
The SMF record types you choose not to record, round out the SMF
display.  This stuff is great.  It's all real time, and it reflects
what your system is actually using.  It beats guessing and getting
fooled by looking at the wrong PARMLIB member.

      The first sixty lines of output are completed by all your CPU
ids and serial numbers, followed by estimated processor speed, the
quantity of real storage available, and the expanded storage installed.
Now you can understand why it might be desirable to refer to this much
data several times during various moments of a day's activity.  You'll
need to examine different parts at different times.


MORE PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS.

      There's another reason to get into the habit of running SHOWMVS
several times a day even if you think you don't need to.  This is for
the repeated learning experience.  As the wealth of information
impresses itself upon your brain, you'll accumulate a greater
understanding of your system's activity.  Your mind will acquire an
instinctive feel for what your system and your session are doing, much
more so than before.  This is especially true with regard to the
program load displays occurring later in the SHOWMVS output.

      The program loading information, which comprises much of the
remainder of SHOWMVS output, is fit for longer study.  Many of us,
including myself, haven't been sufficiently aware that copies of load
modules are loaded into address spaces and used over and over.
Awareness of loaded modules, their responsibility counts, and related
matters, can often shed light into why a new version of a program isn't
taking effect.  An old version of a load module might currently be in
use by your session.  You may have to logoff and logon again to put the
new version of that program into actual use.  SHOWMVS reports all of
this clearly, in its later displays.  Studying the SHOWMVS output in
detail, will clear up much of your confusion as to what is actually
happening regarding program execution.  I found it to be a real
eye-opener.  SHOWMVS output complements Carmine Cannatello's and Mitch
Marx's explanations of program execution mechanisms in MVS.  SHOWMVS
sheds a lot of light in understanding these matters.

      It also won't hurt to refer to SHOWMVS's unit and device
displays frequently.  SHOWMVS will show all the units and devices
online to your system.  You get full detail of your online devices
and their device types.  I've often wanted to see if a particular disk
pack or tape drive was online to one of my systems.  This is
especially true in our large shop with many LPARs.  A quick SHOWMVS
ISPF run, and a "FIND" command in the ensuing BROWSE, settles my
question immediately.  UCB device type numbers are also shown.  On
occasion it's helpful to find out what they are, without trying to
browse the UCB's themselves in virtual storage.


IN CONCLUSION.

      As usual, space restrictions preclude any further explanations
of SHOWMVS here.  I have left a lot out.  I have to leave the rest of
the exploring to you.  However, suffice it to say, that nothing shown
by the enormous SHOWMVS output is useless.  The very reason why its
author chose to include something in his program, is because he needed
to know about it for some reason.

      After all, MVS is a big subject.  Any tool that will help
summarize MVS or give a general picture of it, is of great help to us.
I trust that SHOWMVS will be a great help to all of you.  Good luck in
your searches.  See you next month.

            command.  The wealth of information given here is
            obvious.  On my system, the output of SHOWMVS goes on
            for some 1300 lines in addition to what is included in
            this picture.  As you see, this is quite a big computer.
