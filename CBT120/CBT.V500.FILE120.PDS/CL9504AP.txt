VTOC TIDBITS - Part I

      Sometimes, even we systems programmers get a bit depressed,
and we need to do something exciting to get us out of it.  Once, I
was assigned a long series of humdrum problems to work on, one after
another.  I was starting to forget that I have a set of skills.
Then one evening, one of my colleagues came into my room all in a
panic.  She had deleted a dataset on a new MVS res pack, and she had
no backup.  Could I please help her get the dataset back?

      I sat down for about an hour, and constructed a brand-new Format
1 VTOC entry for the dataset, completely zapping it out of a Format 0
(blank VTOC entry) by hand.  And I got it to work perfectly.  That
was the boost I needed to climb out of my depression and prove to
myself that I was worth my pay.

      This month, I don't have space to tell you how I did that.
But I'd like to spend some time talking about fundamentals related
to this.  We will discuss some of the structure of the DASD table of
contents, known as the "VTOC" for a disk pack.  There are some
interesting fields buried in some of the VTOC records, and one can
only gain by knowing about them.

      When a disk pack is initialized by the ICKDSF program, the
system programmer specifies the size (in tracks) and location of the
VTOC on the disk pack.  Sometimes the VTOC is placed at the beginning
of the pack; sometimes it is placed in the middle.  If a VTOC index is
specified, its placement is also determined at initialization time.

      At this point, I'd just like to mention that if I'm
initializing a pack, my personal preference is to place the index
(if it exists) just behind the actual VTOC, as opposed to just after
it.  That is because the VTOC index dataset is hard to move.  If
you'd later need to enlarge the VTOC, the space just after the end
of the VTOC should be easily available to expand into, and with the
index there, matters become much tougher.


VTOC STRUCTURE.

      Getting back to basics, Track 0, Record 3 of an initialized
disk pack contains the volume serial name of the pack.  This record
also contains a pointer to the CCHHR location of the VTOC as referenced
from the beginning of the pack.  That is how the VTOC, and ultimately
the datasets on the pack, can be located by the operating system.

      The VTOC itself is a direct access, fixed-length unblocked
dataset consisting of the same size records in as many as six, seven
or eight different formats.  There is a 44-byte key at the beginning
of each record, and there are 96 bytes of data which follow the key.
That makes 140 bytes in all.  The VTOC itself originally contained all
or most of the information necessary to describe dataset extents on a
disk pack.

      A "VTOC Index" dataset is an optional and relatively new
development.  It is a separate dataset which keeps track of free
space on the disk.  If the disk pack is not SMS-managed, the VTOC
Index is not absolutely necessary, and if one exists for a non-SMS
pack, we can enable or disable it as we need to.  This month, we
will not discuss any details about the VTOC Index itself.


VTOC RECORD FORMATS.

      There are six (and now possibly seven) non-zero formats among
VTOC records, known more technically as DSCB's or "Data Set Control
Blocks".  The formats are named by number.  We refer to a "Format 1
DSCB" or a "Format 5 DSCB".  Each one of these formats serves a
specialized purpose.  In addition, there are blank VTOC records
consisting of 140 bytes of all hex zeros.  These "empty slots" in a
VTOC are called "Format 0 DSCBs".  Please see Figure 1 for a summary
of all the VTOC record formats.

      Six VTOC formats are mapped by a macro in SYS1.MODGEN (or
SYS1.AMODGEN) called IECSDSL1.  See Figure 2 for an example of how
to code this macro to display these six VTOC formats.  There is now
a seventh VTOC format (called a Format 7 DSCB) that was created to
track the free space on the new 3390 model 9 disk packs.  The model
9's have three times the number of cylinders that a 3390 model 3 has.
And they are so large, that normal Format 5 DSCB's cannot describe
their free space.  Therefore, the Format 7 DSCB was created.  The
Format 7 DSCB is described by a macro called IGGDADS7, which I was
unable to find on my MVS/ESA 4.3 system with DFSMS 1.0.  Maybe
you'll have better luck looking for it on your system.


TOOLS TO USE.

      My philosophy (at least for systems programming), is that it is
better to see than to be blind.  That's what we collect tools for.
I'll show you some IBM tools first.  To print out a VTOC of a disk
pack, you can use the IBM tool IEHLIST with its LISTVTOC DUMP control
card.  The DFP Utilities manual will tell you all the details.
IEHLIST is a fine tool for this purpose.  After you've used IEHLIST to
display all the VTOC records, you can then use the IBM superzap
program called AMASPZAP with its CCHHR control cards, if you need to
change any VTOC fields.  AMASPZAP is documented in IBM's Service Aids
manual.  There are versions of the Service Aids manual that have been
published for all releases of MVS.  Any of them can help you.

      However, I myself don't use the IBM tools.  Instead, I use the
Fullscreen ZAP TSO command from the CBT MVS Utilities Tape.  Program
source for Fullscreen ZAP is on File 134 of that tape, and a load
module is on File 135.  You can order the CBT MVS TAPE through the
NaSPA office.  Fullscreen ZAP will accomplish both the function of
IEHLIST, and the function of AMASPZAP.  Moreover, ZAP operates
interactively on the screen, very quickly.  Since Fullscreen ZAP has a
lot of power, it should of course be restricted to qualified systems
personnel only.  But used properly, ZAP shows you a lot about the VTOC
fields in real time, right on your screen.  See Figures 3 and 4 for
sample ZAP screen images.

      To use the ZAP command to display the start of the VTOC for
pack AKD001, simply enter (from the ISPF command line):  TSO ZAP
'FORMAT4.DSCB' VOL(AKD001).  ZAP contains a full system of help
screens, which you can use by typing a question mark on its command
line.  You also have a detailed report of what record you are in,
what volume you're looking at, and a HEX and EBCDIC character display
of the current record.  ZAP can easily change the record you're
looking at.  If you're altering fields in a VTOC, the index must be
disabled, and you had better be very, very careful and know exactly
the effect of what you're doing.  Nevertheless, ZAP keeps track of
what it changed, and you can print its log out.


SOME FACTS ABOUT THE VTOC HEADER RECORD.

      Our discussion of specific VTOC formats will begin with the
"Format 4 DSCB".  The Format 4 is the first record of the VTOC for a
disk pack, and it can be correctly referred to as the VTOC Header
record.  There is exactly one Format 4 DSCB for each pack.  The
Format 4 DSCB defines and reflects many of the logical and physical
characteristics of the pack, and we will see some very interesting
things in it.

      The 44-byte key of the VTOC Header consists of 44-bytes (2C in
hex) of hex '04'.  The later fields, with specific information, follow
the key.  It seems that because of this, the Format 4 DSCB differs from
all other VTOC formats.  For other formats, +0 displacement into the
VTOC entry begins at the beginning of the key, or in other words, at
the beginning of the record.  For the Format 4 DSCB, displacement +0
begins at +2C from the beginning, or at the beginning of the data.
In other words, +0 into a Format 4 DSCB starts at the 45th byte from
the beginning.  I'm not sure why IBM made that decision, but it seems
from the externals that since there is no real information in the key
of a Format 4 DSCB, we might as well start looking from where the
actual information is.  All other VTOC formats have real information
in the first 44 bytes, and some of them (Formats 2, 3, 5, and 6) use
abbreviated keys and not full keys.

      I'll show you some interesting things in the Format 4.  The
Format 4 describes the entire pack.  At +1E into the Format 4 (which
is really +4A from the beginning of the record) there is a one byte
field which tells how many DSCB's will fit on one track of this pack.
The next byte, +1F, tells you how many PDS directory blocks will fit
on one track of this pack.  For a 3380, the numbers are:  53 VTOC
records (hex 35) and 46 directory blocks (hex 2E) per track.  For a
3390, the numbers are smaller:  50 VTOC entries (hex 32) and 45
directory blocks (hex 2D).  Evidently, the inter-block gaps on a 3390
are bigger than the ones on a 3380.

       At +10 in the Format 4, if bits X'C0' are turned on, the pack
is SMS-managed.  If they are turned off, the pack is not SMS-managed.
The two bytes at +12 tell you how many logical cylinders there are
on the pack.  For example (see Figure 3), on a 3390 model 3, there
are X'D0C' or decimal 3340 logical cylinders on the pack.  The
corresponding numbers for a 3380K are X'A60', or decimal 2656 logical
cylinders.

      At +14, there is a two-byte field which tells you how many
tracks there are in a cylinder.  For both the 3380 and the 3390
devices, this number is X'000F', or 15 tracks per cylinder.  At
+16, the device track length in bytes (hex) is displayed.  For a
3380, the track length is X'BB60' or 47968 bytes.  For a 3390, the
track length is X'E5A2', or 58786 bytes.

      I don't have space this month to go into some of the VTOC
indicator flags that are located at +C into the Format 4.  If you
print out all the VTOC formats for yourself, using the IECSDSL1
macro as in Figure 2, you will acquire a lot more information than
I can mention now.  Especially with an IEHLIST "LISTVTOC DUMP" in
front of you, a bit of study will send you on your way to becoming
an expert in this area.  We'll continue on this topic next time.
Meanwhile, good luck and good hunting!

Figure 1.  A Quick Summary of the VTOC formats.


       FORMAT 0 DSCB  -  Blank entry
       FORMAT 1 DSCB  -  Dataset descriptor
       FORMAT 2 DSCB  -  ISAM dataset information
       FORMAT 3 DSCB  -  Location of extra extents
       FORMAT 4 DSCB  -  VTOC Header Record
       FORMAT 5 DSCB  -  Chained Free Space Descriptors
                           (if VTOC index is disabled or is not there)
       FORMAT 6 DSCB  -  Cylinder sharing
       FORMAT 7 DSCB  -  Free Space Descriptors for 3390 model 9
                           (or future large-capacity disk packs)

  Every VTOC begins with a Format 4 DSCB.  It is always followed
  by one Format 5 DSCB.  This Format 5 DSCB will begin a chain of
  other Format 5's to describe the free space on the volume if
  there is no VTOC Index, or if the VTOC Index is disabled.

Figure 3.   This is a Format 4 DSCB as pictured by the Fullscreen ZAP
            program from the CBT MVS Utilities Tape, File 134.  That
            program is a TSO command.  To obtain the result pictured
            here, you enter TSO ZAP 'FORMAT4.DSCB' VOL(AKD001) .
            This gets you to the VTOC Header for the pack AKD001.
            Fullscreen ZAP has a complete HELP sequence, which you
            can enter by typing a question mark on the command line.
            From the help sequence, if you type a U, you get back to
            where you were.  This volume is a non-SMS 3390 model 3.
