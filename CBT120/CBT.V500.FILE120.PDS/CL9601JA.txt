KEEPING UP WITH THE UNIT CONTROL BLOCK - PART 2

      It's hard to believe that this column is entering its eighth
year.  Time flies when you're having fun!

      This month, we'll continue last month's topic, which is an
attempt to keep up with IBM's changes concering the UCB, or Unit
Control Block.  As we recall from last month, the UCB is the control
block required to define an I/O device to the MVS system.  The UCB
contains almost all the information necessary for the device to be
used in performing I/O requests.  (A few device characteristics are
stored elsewhere, but they are of minimal value.)  It also records the
status of a physical I/O device as represented by a subchannel.  With
the advent of dynamic device reconfiguration, internals of the UCB
arrangement in storage have had to change, and UCB searching methods
have had to be modified.  Therefore, user programs and exits which
access UCB's need to get their act together in order to keep up with
this restructuring.  Many of these programs have stopped functioning
properly in the new environment, and they have to be fixed.

      One good place to find information from IBM manuals, especially
concerning matters that we dealt with last time, is Chapter 23 of the
"MVS Authorized Assembler Programming Guide", which talks about
"Accessing UCB's".  Another manual is the "Planning, Installation,
and Migration" manual for MVS Version 5.  Our purpose today is not to
rehash the information in these manuals, but rather to provide an
increased understanding of some of the internal processes involved.
By so doing, the ultimate result will be that you'll be better able
to fix your own programs, and you'll surely get a deeper view of the
whole situation.

      IBM software planners have given us macro interfacing methods to
use in this new UCB environment.  We now have to invoke certain IBM
Assembler macros such as UCBLOOK, UCBSCAN, IOCINFO, and EDTINFO.  No
longer can we start at the beginning of the big block of UCB's in the
nucleus area and chain through them in order.  Instead, we have to use
this collection of macro interfaces.  The reason is because the system
can now add and subtract UCB's dynamically.  A valid UCB can actually
disappear.  Yet, all the currently valid UCB's must still be
searchable somehow.  These macros are now the only supported IBM
search method.

      There is one other fact to note.  UCB's have "segments" and
"extensions" of various types.  The main part of the UCB is called the
"UCB Common Segment".  The other segments and "UCB extensions" can be
reached in various ways, once we have access to the UCB Common
Segment.  Looking at the macro IEFUCBOB from SYS1.MACLIB, will give
you a lot of specific help.  Our discussion will only concern how to
access the UCB Common Segment.  In the old days, other segments that
existed used to mostly be contiguous in storage with the UCB Common
Segment.  Nowadays, the other segments and extensions usually are
nowhere near the location of the Common Segment.  This is another
reason why our search methods have to be different.

      With the help of my friend Gilbert Saint-flour, I have discovered
a few of the undocumented internals of how UCB searches now work.  I
cannot recommend their direct use, because IBM reserves the right to
change the interface.  Nevertheless I feel that a knowledge of these
mechanisms is instructive and illuminating, and we can profit greatly
from seeing more of how the UCB searches are actually happening.


THE UCB LOOKUP TABLE (OR ULUT)

      Back in the MVS/370 days, UCB's were scanned using a "lookup
table".  This was a sequentially read table which (eventually) pointed
to all the UCB's in the system, as you went through it.  When MVS/XA
came around, completely changing the "channel, path, device" scheme of
device addressing, the proper UCB scanning method became a call to a
routine, pointed to by an address in the CVT, CVTUCBSC.  This method
might still work for "static" UCB's, but its effectiveness is no longer
to be relied on.  Now, to implement dynamic UCB's, IBM has again
reverted to a modified version of the "lookup table" arrangement.  IBM
has hidden this arrangement from public view, calling it through the
use of the UCBSCAN macro, but the guts of a UCB lookup is built on
this table.  Every time a dynamic device reconfiguation is done, the
UCB Lookup Table (or ULUT) gets rebuilt.

      On MVS/ESA systems from release 4.1 through at least release
5.2, the UCB Lookup Table or ULUT can be found in the following way.
From the CVT (Communications Vector Table), which is the anchor for
MVS control blocks, one looks at the contents of field CVTIXAVL at
X'7C' from the beginning of the CVT.  This field points to the address
of the the IO Supervisor's Communication Area (IOCOM).  The address at
displacement X'D0' from the beginning of the IOCOM points to the IOS
Vector Table, or IOVT.  Finally, the address at 8 bytes from the
beginning of the IOVT points to the ULUT.  You can use a core-browsing
program such as LOOK, from File 261 of the public domain CBT MVS
Utilities Tape, to actually see what all this storage looks like.  The
CBT Tape, with all its many tools, can be obtained through the NaSPA
office.  See Figure 1 for a "LOOK" at the beginning of the ULUT.

      The actual ULUT has two parts: its header section, and the
actual UCB lookup table entries.  See Figure 2 for an attempt at a
DSECT description of the ULUT.  Remember that this is an undocumented
interface.

      Gilbert Saint-flour, who wrote the encyclopedic SHOWMVS TSO
command which is on File 183 of the CBT MVS Tape, uncovered many
details of the ULUT's structure.  Gilbert has written actual code to
use this interface, in his SHOWMVS command.  Part of the "UCB" output
from Gilbert's code is shown in Figure 3.

      SHOWMVS was designed to display, under ISPF or in batch, as much
information about your MVS system as possible.  As such, SHOWMVS is an
excellent Auditor or System Programmer tool.  Besides its 30-or-so
other displays, its UCB display shows all online devices in each device
class, who has a dataset most recently allocated on the device, and SMS
information, if the device is SMS-managed.  SHOWMVS, while running under
ISPF, will initiate a subtask that constantly tries to keep all the
displays up-to-date.  Because of this, for the UCB display, actual UCB
addresses are needed to obtain current information--UCB copies will not
do.  Therefore, Gilbert could not employ the standard UCBSCAN interface,
which for un-authorized programs, will only return a copy of the UCB
and not the real one.  Gilbert needed to supply the address of the real
UCB, in an un-authorized environment.

      The ULUT 12-byte table entries may be read sequentially by any
program.  They consist of a halfword hex device address, a halfword of
flags, where the X'4000' bit (indicating a dynamic UCB) is the only
one currently used, a halfword sequence number, and an unused halfword.
Then follows the real UCB common segment address.  The last entry of
the table is marked by zeros in the sequence number field.  Or it can
be calculated by "length" information that is found in the ULUT header.
Gilbert employs the latter method in SHOWMVS.

      I hope that this technical glimpse will enlighten you and arouse
your curiosity.  SHOWMVS source code, including all the methods it uses
to obtain system information, is public-domain and one can learn much
from it.  This code, among Gilbert's other good things, may be found on
File 183 of the CBT MVS Tape, as we said before.  Now we'll finish our
discussion with some program conversion hints.


FIXING EXISTING USER PROGRAMS.

      IBM has classified UCB search methods into two classes:  limited
methods and general methods.  The idea is that the "limited" methods
cannot be used to find dynamic UCB's, but only statically defined
UCB's.  The "general" methods, which are the newer ones, supposedly
can be used to find all defined UCB's, optionally including 4-byte
unit addresses and dynamically defined UCB's.  I might add to this
classificaton, that I think there are some older UCB finding methods
which no longer work at all.

      In Chapter 23 of the "Authorized Assembler Programming Guide"
manual, the limited methods mentioned are the IOSLOOK macro for
finding a single UCB, and the UCB scan SERVICE for scanning multiple
UCB's.  The UCB scan SERVICE is reached from the CVT at displacement
X'434'.  This points to the entry point address of the routine
IOSVSUCB.  Programs using these methods (you can see what they're
doing by looking at their source code) should be converted to use the
UCBLOOK macro to find single UCB's, and the UCBSCAN MACRO to do a
comprehensive search.  As we said before, the UCBSCAN MACRO has a
limitation for non-authorized programs, that it will only return a copy
of the UCB, and not the address of the actual UCB.

      For programs which find units by generic or esoteric unit names
(see MVS/SP System Modifications, Chapter 6), the old way (XA and
above) was to use the Unit Verification Service, module IEFEB4UV,
which has 11 different function calls.  IBM has provided the macro
EDTINFO to supposedly replace this service, but the function calls in
the EDTINFO macro do not match exactly the old calls that were
possible with the IEFEB4UV routine.  For some of the calls, a certain
amount of ingenuity will be necessary if EDTINFO is to obtain the
same effect.

      An example of a program needing this kind of conversion is the
UNITS command from File 360 of the CBT MVS Tape.  UNITS is a TSO
command which will either return all defined generic and esoteric unit
names alone (this part still works), or it will also return all the
unit addresses together with each generic name.  This latter part
doesn't work properly any more, because IEFEB4UV can't find any dynamic
UCB's.  IEFEB4UV comes up empty when asked to display a list of unit
addresses for a given unit name, if they were all defined as dynamic.

      I haven't fixed the UNITS command as yet.  When it gets fixed,
I'll try and share it with you.  If you fix something, please send it
in to the CBT Tape submission address, so you can share it with
everyone too.  That's how this work gets divided, and everybody
benefits because no one individual alone has to do too much of the
total job.

      I'd like to close with a general comment about IBM publications.
You'll need them to get more help, on this and other topics.  IBM,
being one of the largest publishers in the world, would much rather
sell you manuals on CD ROM than on paper.  If you have to research a
certain topic, such as our topic of UCB lookups, it is much easier to
do so when you have all the manuals at hand on your PC.  The MVS
Omnibus Collection, available through your IBM representative, has all
the MVS manuals you'll ever need.  And the Rainbow Collection has all
the "Red Books" and "Yellow Books" etcetera, from all the Systems
Centers.  Get set up with them, and you'll be much more able to deal
with any problem.

      We've got to go now.  I hope this has been enlightening in some
useful way.  We'll see you next month.

Figure 1.   This is a glimpse at the beginning of the UCB Lookup
            Table in storage, using the LOOK TSO command, which is
            a core browser.  The LOOK command can be found on the
            CBT MVS Utilities Tape, in File 261.  This picture
            shows the ULUT header, as well as the beginning of the
            table, which is located at address 0204541C.  The table
            itself consists of 12-byte entries, the last fullword
            of which is the actual UCB address.  For clarity I have
            marked the beginning of each table entry with a comma.
            This table is accessible to non-authorized programs,
            and can be used to scan UCB's, obtaining the actual UCB
            Common Segment address, and not a copy of the UCB.
            This is better than the UCBSCAN service, but it is not
            a documented interface.  The last entry in the table is
            marked by a halfword of zeros in the sequence number
            field.  For a description of record layouts in this
            picture, see Figure 2.  To ensure validity, you have to
            make sure that the IO Configuration has not changed.
            For this you may use the IOCINFO macro from
            SYS1.MACLIB, with the IOCTOKEN keyword.

Figure 3.   This is a sample display of the UCB output from
            the SHOWMVS TSO command.  The SHOWMVS command can
            display its output using the ISPF BRIF (browse)
            service, or it can go to a file.  SHOWMVS under ISPF
            uses an ongoing subtask to update the screen with
            current values every time ENTER is pressed.  The UCB
            part of its display is designed to run un-authorized.
