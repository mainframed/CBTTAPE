MAKING SEQUENTIAL FILES OUT OF PDS'ES - AND VICE-VERSA.

      It's good to be back by popular demand.  Thank you all very much
for making yourselves heard.  My hope is to be able to continue
sharing, helping, and being helped by all of you out there.

      Today's column is about fixed and variable blocked pds'es.
Sometimes it isn't efficient or easy to process them member by member.
There are times when it is better to deal with a single sequential
file constructed from a partitioned dataset, rather than with
the partitioned dataset as it is, member by member.  We shall talk
about creating sequential files from partitioned datasets, and about
reconstructing the partitioned datasets from these sequential files.

      Why should we want to do this?  One obvious purpose is to
download a pds to a PC file.  It's a lot easier to download one file
to one PC file, than to download hundreds of members of a pds, member
by member, into separate PC files in a subdirectory.  The individual
members can later be separated on the PC side by using a file editor
such as SPFPC, KEDIT or DOS EDIT.  Some of you out there might have
better methods of separating the members on the PC.  If so, I'd like
to hear about them.  Please contact me via Naspa headquarters.

      I'll give you another example.  Arnold Casinghino (the founder
and longtime proprietor of the CBT MVS tape) once called me with the
following problem.  He was the ACF2 administrator at his shop, and he
had to deal with a 2000 member pds, LRECL 130.  This was some kind of
ACF2 database, consisting of access rules.  Arnie had to run some CLIST
processing globally against all the members, and it took about an hour
to run because each member had to be accessed separately.  Arnie felt
that if he could convert this pds into a sequential dataset, IEBUPDTE
style with "./ ADD NAME=memname" cards as member headers, his CLIST
would run in a much shorter time.

      The problem was that IEBUPDTE doesn't work for datasets with
LRECL 130, only with record lengths of 80.  Two programs on the
CBT tape that did this processing, OFFLOAD and PDSLOAD, also (at that
time) only handled datasets with an LRECL of 80.  What could Arnie do?

      I set out to solve Arnie's problem.  I didn't want to work
directly with IEBUBDTE because it was IBM's program, but I looked at
the source code to the OFFLOAD and PDSLOAD programs, which are public
domain and which we had available from the CBT tape.  After searching
for all references to the DCB LRECL in the source, I found that I
could convert the LRECL from a hard-coded value of 80 to a global
conditional assembly variable, at all occurrences in both programs.
Then I could assemble both programs for any LRECL that I needed at the
time.  This jury-rigged solution worked well for Arnie's problem, and
his CLIST took only two minutes to run against the sequential file he
created from his ACF2 pds.  The two changed programs, PDSLOAD and
OFFLOAD, were then placed on File 93 of the CBT tape so they could be
used by the public.  Greg Price of Melbourne, Australia has since
fixed PDSLOAD so it doesn't need conditional assembly, but will
automatically handle record lengths for fixed blocked datasets with any
LRECL from 1 to 256.  Greg's version of PDSLOAD is the one on File
93 of the CBT tape currently.

      This process has since gone much farther.  File 93 now contains
more software than those two original programs.  At one point in
time, I discovered the existence of the SHARE PL/I tape, which is
now distributed by SPLA at the University of Miami in Florida
(telephone 305-284-6257).  It's nice to have this tape, especially if
you're a PL/I buff.  Since interest in PL/I is not necessarily limited
to MVS only, the format of that tape's files had to be made available
to the other operating systems.  The format therefore had to be as
close to a flat file as possible.  IEBCOPY-unloaded pds'es are mostly
unacceptable on the SHARE PL/I tape.

      The PL/I tape solution is related to our concerns here.  That
tape supplies two programs, called UNUPDTE and UPDTE, which convert
both fixed blocked and variable blocked pds'es to sequential datasets
using "./ ADD NAME=memname" headers.  UNUPDTE converts a pds to a
sequential dataset, and UPDTE reloads the pds from the sequential
dataset.  Most files on the SHARE PL/I tape are pds'es converted into
sequential files by UNUPDTE.  The advantages of UPDTE and UNUPDTE over
PDSLOAD and OFFLOAD are that UPDTE and UNUPDTE can handle variable
blocked files also.  PDSLOAD and OFFLOAD will only handle fixed blocked
files.  UPDTE and UNUPDTE will deal with record lengths of up to 32760.
I'm not sure if PDSLOAD and OFFLOAD are safe above record lengths of
255.

      Anyway, when I saw the UPDTE and UNUPDTE programs, I called Bob
Styma, proprietor of the SHARE PL/I tape, to ask his permission to
add them to File 93 of the CBT tape.  They are now included there.
Both UPDTE and UNUPDTE use JCL that resembles the corresponding
JCL which IEBUPDTE would use in a similar situation.  See Figure 1 for
an illustration of their JCL.  UNUPDTE and UPDTE are extremely flexible
in the types of datasets they will process.  But they do have one
disadvantage in an MVS environment, which we'll now discuss.


ISPF STATISTICS.

      When IEBUPDTE unloads a pds to a sequential file, the ISPF
statistics for the individual members are lost.  That is because the
(./ ADD NAME= ) IEBUPDTE member headers, as defined by IBM, do not
contain control parameters to preserve ISPF statistics for each
member.  However, this problem has been solved in a standard way by a
number of programs which are on the CBT MVS tape, and by the vendor
product called PDSTOOLS (from Serena International) which handles all
this processing with its COMBINE and SEPARATE subcommands.  These
programs modify the standard IEBUPDTE member header to include the
values of the ISPF statistics for each pds member.  This is done in a
standard format.  See Figure 2.  The modified member headers can
either be processed by IEBUPDTE, with the statistics lost, or by
PDSLOAD and other programs, with the statistics preserved in the new
loaded members.

      Two free programs which preserve ISPF statistics in IEBUPDTE-
format member headers are:  LISTPDS from File 316 of the CBT MVS Tape
(see Figure 2 for its JCL), and Greg Price's version of REVIEW from
File 134 of the CBT Tape.  LISTPDS is a batch program, very nicely
written, but it only handles pds'es with 80-byte record length.
REVIEW will only work interactively as a TSO command.  REVIEW is
normally a browsing program for partitioned datasets, members, and
VSAM files.  But if you REVIEW a pds, you will get a member list with
an 8-byte command area at the top (see Figure 3).  If you had
previously allocated a suitable sequential output dataset under ddname
SYSUT2, you can enter the expression "=OFFLOAD" in the command area of
the REVIEW member list screen.  REVIEW will then dump the contents of
the pds into the SYSUT2 dataset in IEBUPDTE format, preserving any
ISPF statistics present.  This works for FB and VB datasets, and for
any LRECL up to 32760.  Quite nice.  REVIEW will also selectively dump
some members, but not all.  To do that, you must have previously
selected those members from the member list by placing an "O" next to
each of them, before issuing your final =OFFLOAD command.

      If your installation is lucky enough to have the product
PDSTOOLS (formerly PDS/E SysProg Utilities), that product will do all
this work with just two of its many subcommands.  The COMBINE
subcommand of PDSTOOLS will string together any desired group of pds
members into a single file.  You may optionally including IEBUPDTE-type
headers in between, having LISTPDS-format ISPF stats.  The SEPARATE
subcommand of PDSTOOLS will separate a COMBINEd file into individual
members again, stowing ISPF stats back if they were there before.
PDSTOOLS will work with any FB or VB pds, up to LRECL 32760 (VB to
32756).  This product does our job best of all.

      One final note.  Sometimes the data in a pds contains control
cards that are already in IEBUPDTE format.  For example, the data might
contain "./ CHANGE" cards.  In that case, the LISTPDS, OFFLOAD, UNUPDTE
and REVIEW programs change the "./" string to another string, usually
"><", so that an IEBUPDTE reload of the pds would not get confused.
If PDSLOAD reloads the pds, it will automatically restore the "><"
string to "./" when each member is reconstructed.  That process is
controlled by a parm, so that you can substitute an arbitrary
two-character string instead of "><".


SUMMARY.

      I have found many occasions in the course of my career, when
it was inconvenient to deal with a partitioned dataset as a library.
It would have been far more convienient to treat the data as a
single sequential file.  All of you have undoubtedly encountered
numerous times when you wished you could conveniently turn a pds
into a sequential file, do some processing, and turn the sequential
file back into a pds with no loss.  Now you have some tools for this.

      My aim here has been to show you the existence of the technique
and the means to accomplish the result.  Get a CBT Tape (NaSPA
distributes it) and explore the programs we've described here.  You'll
have a few more tools in your box.  Good luck in everything you do.
See you next time.

Figure 1.   JCL to execute the UNUPDTE and UPDTE programs from the
            SHARE PL/I tape, and from File 93 of the CBT MVS Tape.
            Notice how this JCL corresponds closely to IEBUPDTE JCL
            which does the equivalent function.  The difference
            is that UPDTE and UNUPDTE will handle FB and VB datasets
            of any LRECL, as opposed to IEBUPDTE, which only handles
            FB datasets with record length equal to 80.

Figure 2.  JCL to run the LISTPDS program from File 316 of the CBT MVS
           Utilities Tape.  This program preserves ISPF statistics in a
           standard form that can be processed by the PDSLOAD program
           to reload the statistics into a new pds.  The LISTPDS
           program will only sequentialize pds'es with LRECL 80.  Greg
           Price's version of the REVIEW program (File 134 of the CBT
           tape) will perform this "unload" service from TSO
           interactively for FB and VB datasets of any LRECL.  See
           Figure 3.

Figure 3.  Illustration of sequentialization of a pds, using Greg
           Price's verion of the REVIEW command from CBT Tape File
           134.  The REVIEW command has been issued against the pds
           SYS1.PARMLIB.  An output dataset has been previously
           allocated to ddname SYSUT2, and the "=OFFLOAD" command
           has been issued in the REVIEW command area next to the
           word, "LOCATE".

           The bottom part of this figure shows the top of the screen
           when the offloading operation has been completed.
