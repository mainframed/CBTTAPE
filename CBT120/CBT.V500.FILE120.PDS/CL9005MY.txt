      This month, I'd like to continue our mini-series featuring the
marvelous "PDS" product that is found on the CBT Mods Tape.  All of
these discussions also pertain to PDS's vendor-supported successor,
PDS/E (if you happen to have it).  In this column, my emphasis is
mostly on products that are free, first.  The object is for ALL
MVS shops to benefit, regardless of budget.

      Anyone who has extensively used PDS or PDS/E will immediately
understand why we should devote a lot of attention to it.  It is a
multi-purpose time saver and life saver in our business.  PDS is
found on the CBT MVS Mods tape that is obtainable from NaSPA (414)
423-2420, or from SPLA at the University of Miami in Florida
(305) 284-6257.  The PDS/E people usually have an ad in this magazine.

      PDS is easy to get, and is not hard to install.  (One has to
use 3 files on the CBT tape.)  A small effort to obtain PDS and
install PDS, will pay big dividends almost immediately.  I have used
PDS for quite a few years, and PDS/E since before it's been out.  (I
was chief alpha- and beta-tester for PDS/E.)  In spite of my long
exposure to both products, I can practically testify that I learn
some new way to use them, for shop-required purposes, just about
every single working day.

      To get PDS, version 8.3 (or 8.4, which may be available by the
time you read this), you have to obtain a RECENT CBT Tape from
NaSPA, from SPLA, or you may make a copy if one of your friends has
one.  (Remember, this stuff has no restrictions.)  The PDS product
lives on File 182.  Necessary utilities that work together with PDS,
live on Files 296 and 112.

      PDS install is the assembly-link of a load module, and the
copying of ISPF panels and a message member into the appropriate
libraries for your ISPF session to use.  Assembly and linkedit of
the auxiliary load modules from files 296 and 112 completes the
installation.  Options for tailoring the main load module can be
adjusted by using conditional assembly globals that are located in
members #PDSGEN and #PDSGENB of file 182.  That's it.

      After the PDS version 8.3 or 8.4 install, to check which
options you have installed, type the commands:  CONTROL GLOBAL, or
CONTROL ALLGLOBAL.  The first command will display which of your
"gen" options differ from the defaults.  The second command will
display all options that have been set (this is a long list).  With
PDS/E, the equivalent command is:  CONTROL DEFAULTS.

      PDS is executed as a TSO command, or as a dialog manager
option under ISPF.  If ISPF is present in the TSO session, the two
modes may be toggled back and forth.  PDS may also be executed
recursively under ISPF if a command table entry is set up to invoke
it (see my May 1989 column).

      PDS comes with loads of documentation and a TSO help member.
The documentation distributed with "public PDS" is extensive, but
since the product has so many features, you usually have to dig to
discover an EXISTING FACILITY that you didn't know you actually had.
PDS/E has a completely organized user manual (which took enormous
effort to create, as you may well imagine).

TODAY'S TOPIC.

      One purpose of this mini-series is to point out features of
PDS that most users haven't noticed.  This month, we will talk mainly
about its LIST function, which is for looking at all kinds of data
objects.  LIST under PDS, can do much, much more than that name
implies.  Personally, it took me a long time to "discover" the LIST
subcommand, because I did not realize that it provides a good look at
LOAD MODULES and other "strange" objects on disk files.  I had fooled
myself into thinking that it was something like the old TSO LIST
command.  PDS's LIST can show MUCH more.  I've learned over and over
again that one can NEVER assume that "simple" PDS functions are
limited.

      While studying the features of PDS "LIST", one should also bear
in mind that the extremely useful "FIND" and "REPLACE" subcommands
are related to LIST.  A user who has full command and possession of
these three subcommands has enormous power at his disposal.  Some of
this power may not easily be had with any existing utility that I
know of.  Under PDS/E, the DISASSEMBLE and DELINK functions are also
related to the LISTing of load modules.

      The PDS "LIST" subcommand has a number of options, which are
shown in Figure One.  These are divided into two categories, which
we can call "formatting options" and "selection options".  Formatting
options of LIST will change the format of the command's output.  When
one of these LIST formatting options is used during a PDS session,
that option remains in place for the remainder of the session, until
it is changed by another LIST command with a different formatting
option.  We should also know that any FIND or REPLACE commands executed
subsequently, will display their output in the format of the latest
LIST execution.  This is a useful fact, that we will later discover
to be a powerful tool.

      The LIST selection options will limit the extent of the
display or search to selected parts of the data object to be viewed.
LIST selection options will help the user to "zero in" on just what
he wants to look at.  PDS provides a healthy variety of these.

      The rest of the way, we shall try to explain both types of LIST
options, and we hope to show how they can be real power tools in your
hands.  A full explanation of LIST options can be found in Figure Two,
(which is a reprint from the TSO HELP member for PDS).

      Let's start with the formatting options, which are the foundation
for any discussion of LIST under PDS.

LIST Formatting Operands:

       BLOCK / DUMP / LBLOCK / LDUMP / NUM / SNUM / NONUM

      We shall summarize these options in a nutshell.  Then we shall
show how they can be employed by us, to do powerful jobs.  This then,
is a quick description of the LIST formats:

      BLOCK displays EBCDIC.  DUMP displays HEX.  LBLOCK and LDUMP
display LOGICAL structures, while BLOCK and DUMP display PHYSICAL
blocks.  A "power thought" at this point is that if BLOCK or DUMP is
in effect, a FIND command (which locates strings of data) or a
REPLACE command (which does string replacements in place) on a load
module will also discover data in the ESD and IDR parts of the load
module.  If LBLOCK or LDUMP is in effect currently, only the "text"
part of the load module will be searched or changed by the FIND and
REPLACE subcommands.

      NUM, SNUM, and NONUM are for source-type files, FB or VB.
The purpose of the NUM option is to re-show any line numberings at
the beginning of the data to make these more visible, if that is what
is desired by the user.  NONUM does not reformat the display.  SNUM
discards record sequence numbering when the data is displayed.

      So let's look at some pictures.

      Figure Three shows a list of a load module in straight "DUMP"
format.  All data blocks of the entire load module are shown,
including the blocks containing the ESD and IDR records.  Notice that
there are two sets of displacement numbers.  The leftmost set of
displacements starts from the beginning of the data display and
continues across block boundaries.  The set of numbers further to the
right, chronicles displacements into each data block, and is reset
at block boundaries.  I must emphasize that in the straight DUMP
format, you do not get accurate displacements from the beginning of
the executable code--these are PHYSICAL BLOCK DISPLAYS ONLY.  What
happens, is that the displacements of the load module's initial blocks
are added in.  This format is most useful when you want to examine the
"control" parts of the load module data.

      The LDUMP format covers the more usual situation that we have.
An illustration of the LDUMP format in the case of a load module is
shown in Figure Four.  Notice that the bottom of the display indicates
that the load module pds member contains 6 data blocks.  However, only
one block is shown by the display.  That block is the executable code.
Displacements into the data blocks shown by the LDUMP format are the
ones we are familiar with.  They start at the load point of the load
module and continue from there.  If the format of the data is VB
(variable blocked), the LDUMP format will show only the "logical"
data portion, and not the "control" portion (the BDWs and the RDWs)
of each records.  The LDUMP format is the format to be used when you
are not examining the raw physical data, but when you are more
oriented to discovering HOW THE DATA WORKS.

      Figure Five shows the same load module in LBLOCK format.  It is
obvious that since the display of the data is in EBCDIC, this format
is not so well suited for displaying load modules, but is more suited
for written text type data.  It may be useful for load modules and
other "hex" type data when you want to search for embedded messages,
and you don't want to look at the large volume of pure hex data that
you'd see with the LDUMP format.  BLOCK format is similar, but it
shows the "control" parts of the data also.  BLOCK format is useful
if you want to LOOK FOR CHARACTER STRINGS in the "control portion" of
a data object.

      LIST, of course, is also very handy for displaying character-type
data, and for source files and documents.  These are its more obvious
uses, and all the LIST options are applicable to this data also.  For
our article, I merely wish to emphasize the more unusual applications
of LIST, so our readers become aware of more of its power.

      Now, we'll say a few words about the LIST selection options, and
then I'll let you go on and read another article.  For load modules,
the MODULE and OFFSET keyword options are most valuable to know about.
If one has a large load module (IEANUC01 comes to mind) it is not
normally desired to LIST the whole thing.  The MODULE keyword parameter
(see Figure Two for details) allows you to list only one CSECT of the
huge monster, or several CSECTs that you may desire to look at.

      One might add the OFFSET keyword to start a LIST display at
a location in the data that is not at the beginning of what would
normally be displayed.  A display that is started at an OFFSET, will
continue from there, to the end of the data selected for display.

      One uses the SKIPREC and MAXIN keyword parameters of LIST to
display some of the data from the middle of a file, if it is known
how far into the file that the desired data is.  SKIPREC causes you
to skip nnnnnn records (logical or physical, depending on display
format) before you start the display.  MAXIN causes LIST to display
only the number of further records specified in its operand.

      One employs the MAXOUT keyword to start at the beginning of
the desired data, and go only a limited distance into it.  The
operand of the MAXOUT keyword will specify a number of records (or
blocks in the case of a physical record display format).  This
keyword will limit the display, starting from the beginning of what
would normally be shown if MAXOUT had not been specified.

      SKIPCOL and MAXLEN are keywords that force the display to
start after the beginning of a record, and end before its end.  It
is recommended that you play with these keywords after PDS or PDS/E
is installed at your shop.

      Please bear in mind that the "selection" operands of LIST
apply to the "FIND" and "REPLACE" subcommands of PDS and PDS/E also.

      And that's it.  Be creative.  See you next month.

      Please let me know of any "PDS(/E)" Newsletter ideas that you
have.  My phone number is              .  Thanks.

FIGURE ONE.  LIST Syntax.  This panel shows the LIST syntax,
               which is applicable to SOURCE-type files, fixed or
               variable blocked, and to LOAD MODULES and RECFM=U
               files.  This syntax applies equally to PDS 8.3 and
               to PDS/E, but the panel comes from the PDS/E syntax
               error prompter.  Both PDS 8.x and PDS/E have more
               detailed information in the TSO HELP member.  PDS/E
               has a complete user manual describing all of its
               subcommands in detail.

=LIST=L=LI=LIS
)F  Example -     LIST mema:memb

  The LIST subcommand displays data from a member.

  Unprintable characters for 3270-type devices are translated to
  periods before they are displayed.

  The LIST formats are NUM, SNUM, NONUM, LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP;
  for load modules, the NUM, SNUM and NONUM formats are equivalent
  to the LDUMP format.

  The default format is initially NUM; however, each time a format
  operand is entered on a LIST, FIND or REPLACE subcommand, the value
  entered is used as the output format for subsequent LIST, FIND and
  REPLACE subcommands.  Also, note the following:
    A. Formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM limit the display length for logical
       records to 256 characters.
    B. Formats BLOCK and DUMP apply to physical records; the other
       formats apply to logical records; and for load modules, LBLOCK
       and LDUMP formats apply to CSECT data.

)O OPERANDS -
  member     -  optional, specifies the name of the member(s) to be
                listed.

                Default member names, member lists, member name
                ranges and member name patterns are allowed; for
                more information, enter HELP GROUP.

  LIST format keywords are as follows:
))NUM        -  The line number field (the last 8 bytes of a fixed-
                format record or the first 8 bytes otherwise) of
                each logical record is examined; if the field is not
                numeric, formatting is switched to NONUM mode for the
                remainder of the member.

                For SPF-saved members, the high-order six digits of
                the line number field is formatted; otherwise, the
                low-order six digits of the line number field is
                formatted by suppressing leading zeroes.  The line
                number segment is followed by a blank and up to 249
                characters of data from a logical record.
))SNUM       -  The line number field (the last 8 bytes for a fixed-
                format record or the first 8 otherwise) is discarded.
                Up to 256 bytes from a logical record are displayed.
))NONUM      -  Up to 256 bytes from a logical record are displayed.
))LBLOCK     -  Logical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement
                in the logical record) and segments of 64 characters
                surrounded by asterisks.

                Note: for load modules, only CSECT data will be
                displayed and if the partial name Partm is entered
                in a MODULE operand, only those CSECT or ENTRY names
                matching Partm will be displayed.  CSECT records
                are formatted with two hexadecimal offsets (a module
                offset and a CSECT offset) and segments of 64
                characters surrounded by asterisks.
))LDUMP      -  Logical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement
                in the logical record), segments of up to 32
                characters of hexadecimal data and up to 16 bytes of
                equivalent characters surrounded by asterisks.

                Note: for load modules, only CSECT data will be
                displayed and if the partial name Partm is entered in
                a MODULE operand, only those CSECT or ENTRY names
                matching Partm will be displayed.  CSECT records are
                formatted with two hexadecimal offsets (a module offset
                and a CSECT offset), segments of up to 32 characters of
                hexadecimal data and up to 16 bytes of characters
                surrounded by asterisks.
))BLOCK      -  Physical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement
                in the physical record) and segments of 64 characters
                surrounded by asterisks.
))DUMP       -  Physical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement
                in the physical record), segments of up to 32
                characters of hexadecimal data and up to 16 bytes of
                equivalent characters surrounded by asterisks.
  LIST control keywords are as follows:
))OFFSET(Hx)  - for LBLOCK and LDUMP formats only; Hx may be entered
                as a 1 to six digit hexadecimal number to specify
                the module offset at which the display is to begin.

                If both MODULE AND OFFSET keywords are entered, the
                offset applies to each module selected.
))MODULE(Partm)-for LBLOCK or LDUMP formats only; Partm may be entered
                as a 1 to 8 byte partial external name to limit the
                CSECT or ENTRY names to be displayed to those matching
                the partial name Partm.

                If the form MODULE(*) is used, the previous partial
                name entered on any MODULE keyword will be used.

                If both MODULE AND OFFSET keywords are entered, the
                offset applies to each module selected.
))SKIPREC(n)  - n is coded as 0 through 9999999 to specify the number
                of logical records (physical records for BLOCK or
                DUMP formats) to ignore at the beginning of a member.
))MAXIN(n)    - n is coded as 0 through 9999999 to specify the maximum
                number of logical records (physical records for BLOCK
                or DUMP formats) to input for a member after
                satisfying any SKIPREC operand.
))MAXOUT(n)   - n is coded as 0 through 9999999 to specify the maximum
                number of logical records (physical records for BLOCK
                or DUMP formats) to output for a member.
))SKIPCOL(n)  - n is coded as 0 through 99999 to specify the number
                of columns to ignore at the beginning of each logical
                record (physical record for BLOCK or DUMP formats).

                Note:  for NUM or SNUM output format with record
                format V, SKIPCOL(0) refers to the first data position
                after the line number field.
))MAXLEN(n)   - n is coded as 0 through 99999 to specify the maximum
                length of a logical record (physical record for BLOCK
                or DUMP formats) to display.

FIGURE THREE.   This is a LIST of a LOAD MODULE in DUMP FORMAT.
                 Notice that the displacements in the entire module
                 are measured from the beginning of the first data
                 block, and NOT from the beginning of the executable
                 code.  This represents display of the PHYSICAL data.
                 We would have needed the LDUMP format of Figure Four
                 to display logical displacement values in the way we
                 are used to seeing and using these values.  FIND and
                 REPLACE commands which will follow this LIST, can
                 affect ALL of the data, because the scan is PHYSICAL,
                 and not logical.  Even the IDR and ESD data can be
                 scanned and replaced using this format.  If the
                 data being listed were in VB format instead of in
                 RECFM=U, physical blocks, including block
                 descriptor words (BDWs) and record descriptor
                 words (RDWs) would have been displayed by LIST.

FIGURE FOUR.   This is a DUMP OF LOGICAL DATA in a LOAD MODULE,
                using the LDUMP FORMAT of LIST.  Notice that even
                though the module contains 6 records, only the
                executable code is shown.  The ESD and IDR records
                at the beginning of the load module are not considered.
                Displacement OFFSETS are measured from the beginning
                of the executable code, in the "normal" way that we
                are used to.  A FIND or REPLACE command which would
                follow this LIST command, will affect only the
                executable portion of the load module.  If the
                data being listed were in VB format instead of
                RECFM=U, LOGICAL RECORDS would be displayed in HEX
                by this format of the LIST command.  BDWs and RDWs
                would not be shown.

FIGURE FIVE.   LBLOCK FORMAT for a LOAD MODULE only shows data in
                EBCDIC form.  "Unprintable" data which might cause
                trouble when a display is attempted to a terminal,
                is converted into periods.  This form of display may
                be of limited usefulness for load modules, and might
                only serve to highlight character strings in them.
                For RECFM=VB source-type data, this format would be
                extremely useful.
