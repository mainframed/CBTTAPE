Sam Golob is a Senior Systems Programmer.


LOOKING AT VIRTUAL STORAGE

      Many of us would write much more code if we could only see what
we were writing about.  I still remember when I was an application
programmer.  If I ever had to write a program to manipulate a file, I
always had to get a sample production file, and copy it as a test file.
Then I'd look at it very carefully before attempting to write my code.
You have to see the data you're programming about.  I also remember
much later, as a systems programmer, when I was enhancing the TAPEMAP
program (from File 299 of the CBT MVS Tape).  TAPEMAP is very careful
to "feel" the data at the beginning of each tape file, in order to
classify it as IEBCOPY format, IEBUPDTE, SMPPTFIN, etc.  Therefore, I
needed the TAPESCAN program (from File 102 of the CBT tape) or the
DITTO tape functions, to give me a byte-by-byte detailed description
of all the tape files to be studied, in hex.  I had to look, in order
to be able to program.

      Now here's the 64 dollar question:  "When you're a systems
programmer writing code that accesses system control blocks in virtual
storage, how can you get a good look at the data you're writing
about?"

      Remember that you have to look at actual virtual storage which is
running in your address space, or in another address space, and it
helps, if you can follow control block chains.  There are a few vendor
tools to do this, such as the XDC Debugger from Cole Software, and
there's TSO TEST, but there's also a free tool that can be had and
used, by anybody.  This is the extremely clever LOOK program from File
264 of the CBT MVS Utilities Tape.  LOOK was enhanced by Guy Albertelli
from the original program, which was once part of a free software
product called DCMS.  This LOOK program or any similar product, is an
absolute must to use, if you're writing system level code, and you need
to see the data in detail.

      The CBT MVS Utilities Tape, if you don't already know, is an
independently produced tape which is distributed by several sources,
including NaSPA.  The tape may be freely copied, and it is of immense
value to MVS Systems Programmers.  When you need to do a job, and you
don't know how to do it, the CBT Tape is one of the first places to
search, to find out if someone else has done a similar job already.
Most of the software on the CBT Tape is in source form, and you can
study it and modify it to your heart's content.  So you can get your
job done, and you can learn to code in assembler or PL/I, or whatever
language the software is written in, better than you could before.

      Now we'll begin to see how the LOOK program can show us
in-storage data, and format it automatically as a system control block.
Then we'll navigate through storage, from control block to control
block, from pointer to pointer, and from there to the data.

      My friend and teacher Jeff Broido told me early in my training,
that whenever he wrote system code to access control blocks, he would
always see what he was doing by using the LOOK program.


WHAT KIND OF PROGRAM IS "LOOK"?

      LOOK is a TSO command, which is designed to run interactively,
in full screen mode, under TSO.  LOOK will show you chunks of virtual
storage in your own address space, in HEX and EBCDIC.  This gives you
access to common storage as well.  If LOOK is running authorized, LOOK
is capable of showing similar private storage in any other address
space.  It does this by issuing an SRB to go cross memory to retrieve
the block of storage from the other address space.  A user of LOOK goes
from one full screen of data to another.  Two pfkeys enable the user to
go back to previous screens, or to go forward.  From any screen of data,
you can explore new storage as you like.  Once you learn the subcommands
of LOOK, you'll come to appreciate its great flexibility.

      Today we'll see how LOOK works, by actually doing something.  A
simple program I once wrote, a TSO command to display your own userid,
finds the userid by following pointers in control blocks, starting from
the CVT (Commuication Vector Table), which is the "backbone" of pointers
to most locations on an MVS or OS/390 system.  Figure 1 shows the actual
simple code, and Figures 2 through 6 show LOOK screens which illustrate
the storage at each control block location, as we follow the chain to
the location of the PSCB, and the data we want.  Using LOOK, you can see
what you're programming.  You're not working in the dark.

      LOOK has quite a few useful commands.  You can enter a virtual
address, and LOOK will take you there, if the address is accessible.
LOOK always has a current address pointer.  Its initial value is
00000000, or low storage.  This is formatted as PSA, or Prefixed Save
Area.  Indirect addressing is done with an I or a J.  I, which is a
carryover from the 24-bit only days, does indirect addressing in 24-bit
mode.  J does indirect addressing in 31-bit mode.  Indirect addressing
means the following:  If a fullword in virtual storage contains an
address of somewhere else in virtual storage, then a J command, on the
current fullword, will take you to the address that's in that fullword.
This corresponds to a LOAD instruction in assembler language.  The J
instruction therefore helps us follow control block chains.  The code
in the assembler program of Figure 1, has a sequence of five LOAD
instructions.  The corresponding commands to LOOK, illustrated by
Figures 2 thru 6, are a sequence of five J instructions.

      Figure 7 shows the LOOK help screen.  LOOK doesn't have an
enormous number of commands, but what it does have, allows for great
flexibility to track locations in virtual machine storage.

      One other noteworthy aspect of LOOK, is its ability to recognize
and format system control blocks, and to run from one control block to
another, through indirect LINKs.  LOOK contains very clever code which
allows you to format any control block fields, according to their macro
definitions.  In other words, LOOK can format fields in the CVT through
an assembly of the CVT macro.  The TCB can be formatted by invoking
an assembly of the IKJTCB macro.  The ASCB is formatted by assembling
the IHAASCB macro, and so forth.  By coding a few lines in the CBMACS
source member, any control block that is described by a mapping macro,
can be formatted to the LOOK program.

      If a control block is formatted on a LOOK screen, you can get to
any address in a formatted field, by using a LINK or L command.  For
example, look at Figure 2, which is a formatted mapping of the CVT.  If
you want to display the location of the TCBP field from the CVT, you
can enter the command LTCBP (or Link to TCBP), and you'll display
storage starting at the location specified in the address, which is
00000218.  So, starting from the CVT, you can get to the TCBP field by
either entering J+0, or LTCBP, or 00000218 as commands.  They will all
yield the same result.

      Space is short this month, because of all the illustrations, but
since a picture is worth a thousand words, there should be a lot of
content in what we've said today.  Whether you're writing code, or
checking up on how your system is working, or diagnosing a system
problem, or simply exploring, it pays to be able to see the storage
that's in the system.  Good luck, and good LOOKing.  See you next month.

Figure 1.   This is a simple TSO command called MYID, which finds
            the userid of the invoker, and displays it on the tube.
            This command gets the userid from the PSCBUSER field
            of the TSO Protected Step Control Block (PSCB).
            This field is obtained by running a control block chain
            starting from the CVT, as illustrated by the code.
            Then we're going to use the LOOK program to actually
            see the storage at each stage.

Figure 2.   This is the LOOK screen, with the first page of the CVT,
            formatted out.  You get to the CVT from the pointer at
            virtual location X'10' or Decimal 16.  In LOOK parlance,
            the command is J10.  You see that LOOK uses the hex value.

Figure 3.   This is storage (unformatted) at the location of the
            TCB pointers for your address space.  If LOOK recognizes
            a control block and formats it, you can turn off the
            formatting with the command:  ONULL.  If you want to
            purposely format some storage as if it were a CVT, you
            would use the command:  OCVT .  You get the idea.

Figure 6.   The PSCB is X'108' off the previous location, which
            is the JSCBPSCB field of the JSCB.  We could not get
            to this location with a label Link command, because
            the previous screen was not formatted as the JSCB
            control block.  We are looking at the storage which is
            pointed to by the address at that location.  Lo and
            behold, the PSCB can be seen in storage.  The PSCBUSER
            field of the PSCB is 7 bytes long, starting from the
            beginning of the PSCB control block.  And it's got our
            userid there.  In our program, we just have to move
            these 7 bytes into the TPUT display to the terminal,
            and we're done.  It pays to see what you are doing!

Figure 7.   HELP screen for the LOOK command.  This will remind the
            user of LOOK what can be done.  There's really a lot
            of flexibility, if you study this command set.

LOOK is a real time core display and formatting program. It also has the
capability of displaying memory in any address space (if authorized).

The valid commands are:
Iexp  24 bit indirect                 | Jexp  31 bit indirect
>     Forward                         | <     Backward
=sym  Define current address as "sym" | ,sym  Redisplay core at "sym"
M0/M1 Flip between top and center     | Lname Indirect thru control block field
Ocb   Format as "cb" control block    | R     Refresh displayed storage
      "cb" may be NULL to show as hex |

where 'exp' is of the form:
    <+/->hhhh<+/-hhhh<+/-hhhh...>>
and 'hhhh' is a 1 to 8 digit hex number.
