File 008 of the CBT Tape contains many of the jobs needed to
create this new tape.  When all the members have been prepared to
create a new tape version, the necessary jobs will have to be
copied to dataset SBGOLOB.CBTnnn.FILE008, and File 008 has to be
updated on the CBT site.  File 008 is supposed to reflect the
jobs needed to create the new CBT tape version, so before you
cut a new tape version, the last thing you have to do, is update
File 008 for the new version, and prepare it for the Updates page.


The new tape version will be cut from jobs on SBGOLOB.CBT496.FILE008
which are of the form:  NEWTnnna

   The first 10 of these jobs actually cut the new tape in SL format.

   The jobs afterwards create the NL version, measure it, and then
     you have to correct the measurements for the new tape, on
     SBGOLOB.CBTDOC.PDS, and then you create a new FILE001 on
     SBGOLOB.CBT.EDIT by running COMBINE : 'SBGOLOB.CBT.CNTL' NOSEP
     under STARTOOL, and then running the CLIST called DOCFILA
     to fix columns 73-80 and copy that FILE001 to
     SBGOLOB.CBT.EDIT(FILE001).

   You replace FILE001 on all versions of the new tape with the
     new edit version that has the correct measurements and dates.
     This is the final cut tape of the new version.

   Jobs to do this, are in SBGOLOB.CBT.EDIT in the form NEWTnnna.


Jobs needed to be run after a new CBT Tape has been created.

   Volumes CBTA01 thru CBTA04 have the following functions:

       CBTA01 - Contains completely unloaded CBT Tape files
                 from the current tape version
                 Jobs VnnnJ01 thru VnnnJ10 will load this
                 pack, after job DELNTnnn has deleted and
                 uncataloged all the old files there.
                 For good measure, ZZSA is the IPL text on
                 this volume.

       CBTA02 - Contains all the CBT files for this version
                 which are being prepared to update the
                 web site directory "CBT".  These are in the
                 form CBT.Vnnn.FILExxx.DATA   or the
                 form CBT.Vnnn.FILExxx.XMI
                Jobs to produce the XMIT-format files are in
                 members VnnnX01 thru VnnnX09.

       CBTA03 - Contains a DFDSS restore of a backup of volume
                 DATA03 at a level concurrent with when the new
                 tape version was cut and the tape was made.
                 Jobs to load this volume are DFDSSBK3 and DFDSSR4.

       CBTA04 - Contains all the XMIT-format files for all the
                 files on the CBT tape, created as the files are
                 updated in real time, in between cuts of the
                 tape versions.

Run the following sets of jobs in the stated order, after the
tape version has been cut and finalized.

1.   DFDSSBK3 and DFDSSR4 to back up and restore the DATA03 pack
     to the CBTA03 pack.  This is the final image of DATA03 after
     creating the new tape version, and before any renames have
     been done to any files.

2.   TSORnnn - Job to rename all new files consistently so that
     they have similar names to the old files.  This will provide
     a fixed base upon which to build the next tape version.

     Files of form:  SBGOLOB.CBTnnn.FILExxx   will be renamed to
     files of form:  CBT.CBTnnn.FILExxx.PDS   or
                     CBT.CBTnnn.FILExxx.DATA

     Files of form:  CBT.CBTmmm.FILExxx.PDS   will be renamed to
     files of form:  CBT.CBTnnn.FILExxx.PDS   or
                     CBT.CBTnnn.FILExxx.DATA

        where nnn = mmm + 1      (new version number)
              mmm                (old version number)

3.   Edit and run job DELNTnnn which will delete and uncatalog all
     of the files on volume CBTA01.  This volume is the volume that
     will be posted on the CBT web site www.cbttape.org as a DFDSS
     backup and an FDR backup.  This volume also contains IPL text
     for ZZSA.  (Job IPLTZZSA)


4.   Edit and run jobs VnnnJ01 thru VnnnJ10, which will load volume
     CBTA01 with all the datasets from the current CBT Tape volume
     that you just made.

5.   Run jobs DFDSSBKV and FDRBACKV to produce DFDSS and FDR backups
     of volume CBTA01.

6.   Run jobs TRSCBTD1 and TRSCBTF1 to produce tersed files of these
     backups.  These tersed files will be posted to the web site.

7.   Some of the jobs of the form:  NEWTnnna  will TAPEMAP the newly
     created CBT Tape version.  Go to SDSF and copy the TAPEMAP of
     the latest version to SBGOLOB.OUTPUTS(CBTnnnM).  Use the NL
     version of the tape, because this TAPEMAP will be posted to
     the web site.

8.   Replace all the places in the web site which have version mmm
     in it, with equivalents of version nnn, where nnn = mmm + 1.
     Delete versions that are two back.  Only keep one previous
     version.


Web Site Updates


1.   .zip files will have to be prepared from the .XMI and .DATA
     files that are on volume CBTA01.

     FTP all of these files in BINARY from volume CBTA01 to a
     directory cbt-nnn that is on the PC.

     Use Win-RAR to zip all of these files in bulk, to a new
     directory on the PC:  cbt-nnnz

     Back up the entire CBT directory on the web site.
     Back up the entire Updates directory on the web site.

     Update the CBT directory with the new files from directory
     cbt-nnnz.

     Replace all files on the CBT directory with the new files
     from the new version.

     Replace all the places in the web site which have version mmm
     in it, with equivalents of version nnn, where nnn = mmm + 1.
     Delete versions that are two back.  Only keep one previous
     version.
