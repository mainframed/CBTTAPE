Welcome to the Internet Surf File (File 050).

      This file contains only pointers to Internet-based web
sites.  See member @FILE050 for index information.

      This file points to sites containing downloadable free
software tools.  File 051 points to vendor product sites.

      This file was inspired by Dave Cartwright, who at one point,
started emailing me lists of MVS web sites to check out.  We decided
to start a CBT Tape file that points users to some of them.  Often,
the proprietors of the stuff can't (practically speaking) import
their things to the CBT Tape directly.  Sometimes they update their
things very often, not in coincidence with when the CBT Tape gets
updated.  And also, sometimes the stuff can't be easily put into
the CBT Tape partitioned dataset format, such as a free UNIX based
C compiler I recently discovered.  So, we'll point you to them,
and you can grab 'em for youselves, if you want them.

      Anyone can feel free to inform me about a useful MVS site.
I'll be the proprietor of this file, but if you have any useful
updates, just send them to me via email and I'll merge them in.
If you can put the info into my (standard?) format, then please do
so.  Otherwise, I'll do it myself.

      Thanks in advance.
