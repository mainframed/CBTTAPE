------------------------------------------

1.0 Installation of SLEEP

    Supplied Material :
    README.TXT    -  This file
    SLEEP.TXT     -  Assembler source code for the SLEEP function

    (a) File transfer the SLEEP.TXT file to the mainframe host
        using ASCII-EBCDIC translation.

    (b) Assemble and link SLEEP into a load library that is
        available to your TSO userid. Use the following
        linkedit attributes :
           AMODE(31)
           RMODE(ANY)
           RENT
           REUS
           AC(0)

2.0 Using SLEEP

    The program will wait for a specified amount of seconds. The number
    of seconds to wait for is passed as a parameter to the function
    by the invoking REXX Exec. If no parameter is passed, a default of
    10 seconds is used. The maximum specification is 99999 seconds.

    Syntax :

        rcode = SLEEP(secs)

    Keywords :

        RCODE
          The return code from the SLEEP function. This can be one of
          the following values :
            0  - Successful execution of the function
           -1  - Error in the parameter passed. Verify that the
                 seconds passed is numeric and between 1 and 99999.

        SECS
          The number of seconds to wait for. This value can be between 1 and
          99999. If not specified, SLEEP will use a default value of 10.

    Example :

      rcode = SLEEP(60)  /* Wait for a minute */
