//*        Note:  The flexescli_inetd program, by way of xinetd     *   FILE 714
//*        is listening on a port.  The MVS side of the program     *   FILE 714
//*        will contact the flexescli_inetd program using the       *   FILE 714
//*        IP address of the UNIX side of the system and the        *   FILE 714
//*        port.  The MVS side has the port 19999 coded into it     *   FILE 714
//*        as a default although it can be overridden with the      *   FILE 714
//*        port= parameter to the main parm string.                 *   FILE 714
//*                                                                 *   FILE 714
//*        The port on the Unix side is specified in                *   FILE 714
//*        /etc/services.  The update to /etc/services is shown     *   FILE 714
//*        in flexescli_inetd.c using the port 19999.  You may      *   FILE 714
//*        wish to use a different port.  If you use a              *   FILE 714
//*        different port, update the MVS program (member           *   FILE 714
//*        PLISRC) to reflect the new port.  You will probably      *   FILE 714
//*        update it to change the default IP address to the        *   FILE 714
//*        correct value on your system.                            *   FILE 714
//*                                                                 *   FILE 714
