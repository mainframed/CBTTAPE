                                 1.  INTRODUCTION
0          This publication is  intended to meet the needs  of ISPF in-
           stallations which are  developing their own ISPF  dialogs or
           installing IBM  or other vendor  products which use  ISPF as
           their dialog  manager.   The objectives of  this publication
           are to:
0             1.  Establish  standards for  ISPF  dialogs to  ensure
+                 _________
                  that all dialogs which follow these standards will
                  act in  a consistent  manner.   Major  emphasis is
                  placed on  how a dialog  looks to the  user (panel
                  layouts, message formats, etc.).  Because ISPF/PDF
                  is  the dialog  which  has  the broadest  base  of
                  users,  the  standards proposed here are  based on
                  the way in which ISPF/PDF interacts with the user.
0             2.  Document some of  the more common pitfalls  in de-
+                 ________
                  signing and writing ISPF dialogs.
0             3.  Discuss concerns  related to the  installation and
+                 _______
                  maintenance of  ISPF dialogs  (naming conventions,
                  library concatenations,  making changes to system-
                  wide dialog components, etc.).
0             4.  Propose  some intermediate  solutions to  problems
+                 _______
                  caused by deficiencies in  ISPF (e.g.  freeing and
                  re-allocating  ISPF files  while executing  ISPF).
                  It  is hoped  that IBM  will  eventually make  the
                  changes to  ISPF which are necessary  to eliminate
                  these deficiencies.

                               2.  NAMING STANDARDS
0          2.1   GENERAL
+                _______
0          Naming standards must be established for the member names of
           ISPF components (panels, messages, CLISTs, etc.)  to prevent
           member name  conflicts.   Member names should  also identify
           the dialog or application in which the member is used or the
           group which developed the dialog or application.
0          Conflicting member names are a  concern because most instal-
           lations run ISPF  as a concatenation of  libraries from dif-
           ferent sources.    The IBM ISPF  and ISPF/PDF  libraries are
           concatenated with other  vendor ISPF libraries and  with li-
           braries of dialogs developed at the installation.   Some in-
           stallations have many different ISPF libraries corresponding
           to different groups of users.    If no naming convention has
           been established,   libraries which  contain members  of the
           same name may be concatenated.  When multiple members of the
           same name exist  in a concatenation,  only  the first member
           found with the specified name is accessible.
0          There may not be any one  naming standard which is appropri-
           ate for every installation.   The purpose here is to propose
           several possible naming standards and discuss their relative
           advantages and disadvantages.
0          Naming conventions  should be established  for all  parts of
           the dialog (panels,  messages,  skeletons,  CLISTs,  tables,
           programs).  Naming conventions should be established for all
           Profile pool variables within a given profile (identified by
           the NEWAPPL id).   Naming  conventions should be established
           for all Shared pool variables within a given NEWPOOL.

           2.2   REQUIREMENTS
+                ____________
0          Any naming standard should meet the following requirements:
0             1.  Member names  must be unique across  any libraries
                  which are  concatenated together.   If  the System
                  Modification Program (SMP)  is to be used to main-
-                                           - 2 -

-
                  tain the dialogs,  each distinct component of each
                  dialog must be uniquely named across all libraries
                  that SMP will maintain.
0             2.  The member name should identify  the dialog or ap-
                  plication which  the component  belongs to.    The
                  naming standard should  also accomodate components
                  which are used by many different dialogs.
0             3.  The naming  standard should use as  few characters
                  as possible, so that the dialog developer has some
                  characters  for  his/her own  use.    Because  the
                  length of  the names is  limited to  8 characters,
                  each  character required  by  the naming  standard
                  must be justified.
0          In addition to the above,  the naming standard should,  ide-
           ally, encourage the use of mnemonics in names.   Well-chosen
           mnemonics are useful in  communicating information about the
           function of the component.
-
           2.3   IDENTIFIERS
+                ___________
0          The member name should include some of the following identi-
           fiers:
0             1.  SYSTEM ID - identify the  system to which the dia-
                  log belongs
0                 A system id identifies  the application system but
                  not the dialog  to which a specific  component be-
                  longs.  A list of system ids must be maintained to
                  ensure uniqueness.
0             2.  GROUP ID - identify the  group or department which
                  developed the dialog
0                 If group id is used,  the group which is responsi-
                  ble for the dialog is easily identified when prob-
                  lems occur or changes need  to be made.   This may
                  not be important if each group  has its own set of
-                                           - 3 -

-
                  ISPF libraries concatenated.   A list of group ids
                  must be maintained to ensure uniqueness.
0             3.  DIALOG ID - identify the  dialog to which the mem-
                  ber belongs
0                 Member names  which identify  the dialog  to which
                  the member  belongs are useful in  maintaining the
                  ISPF libraries.  All components of a dialog can be
                  identified if  each member name contains  a dialog
                  ID.   When  a problem  with a  specific member  is
                  found,  it is  easy to determine which  dialog and
                  which other ISPF components  may be affected.   If
                  dialog id is  used,  a list of dialog  ids must be
                  maintained to ensure uniqueness.
0                 Dialog id could be used in conjunction with system
                  id or group id to  further identify the component.
                  For example,  system  id or group id  could be de-
                  fined  as a  3-character code  and dialogs  within
                  each  system/group   could  be  identified   by  a
                  1-character code.
0             4.  TYPE - the type of ISPF component
                         @ for Primary Option Menu (POM) panels
                         $ for non-POM Selection menus
                         B for table display panels
                         D for display/data entry panels
                         E for CLISTs
                         H for Help/Tutorial panels
                         K for skeletons
                         L for models
                         T for tables
                         0 (zero) for load modules
                         P for profile variables
                         S for shared variables
                         F for function variables (recommended)
0                 The  type indicator  is useful  in naming  components
                  which  are maintained  by SMP  (because every  member
                  name must  be unique across all  libraries maintained
                  by SMP).   It  can also be useful  in differentiating
                  between the different types of  panels within a panel
                  library.

              5.  VERSION - version of the member,  dialog or appli-
                  cation
0             6.  INSTALLATION CODE - may be used to designate which
                  system the member is to be used in (e.g.  V for VM
                  or M for MVS)

           2.4   SOME NAMING STANDARDS WHICH ARE IN USE NOW
+                ____ ______ _________ _____ ___ __ ___ ___
0          Because of  the connection  between message-ids  and message
           member names,  some of the following naming conventions can-
           not be applied to message member names.
0          The number of  characters specified in the  following naming
           standards are given as an  example.   Each installation will
           have  different requirements  for the  number of  characters
           used for an identifier.

                 6-8     specified by developer
0             Comments - this convention allows the dialog developer to
                choose a meaningful naming scheme  for part of the mem-
                ber name,   while still providing information  which is
                useful in identifying the component.

                 1-3     Dialog ID / Group ID / System ID
                   4     Type of component
                 5-8     each character is an alphameric
                         character which indicates the option
                         number at the at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd
                         and 4th level of the dialog hierarchy
0             Advantages -  the member  name indicates  where the  ISPF
                component belongs in the dialog hierarchy.

              Disadvantages  - If  the organization  of  the dialog  is
                changed,  the member names would  need to be changed to
                reflect the new hierarchy.

                                    3.  PANELS
0          3.1   GENERAL
+                _______
0             1.  Installation-developed  panels should  be as  con-
                  sistent as possible with ISPF/PDF panels.
0             2.  All dialogs should make use of the HELP facility.
0             3.  All  dialogs should  support both  short and  long
                  messages.
0             4.  Always  use the  default message  area to  display
                  messages.  This is an important part of the format
                  to which dialog users have become accustomed.  The
                  default area  for the short  message is  the upper
                  right hand corner of the panel (line 1).   The de-
                  fault  area for  the long  message  is the  entire
                  third line of the panel.
0             5.  Be careful in the use of color.  The user needs to
                  know  where  to  focus his/her  attention  on  the
                  screen.  An excess of color and/or highlighting on
                  a panel  is confusing and  can also cause  eye fa-
                  tigue.
0             6.  Panel formats should generally be designed for the
                  standard terminal screen size (24  rows by 80 col-
                  umns).
0             7.  To display large amounts of information,  use more
                  panels with less information per panel rather than
                  fewer panels with more information per panel.
0             8.  If  it is  necessary to  pad an  input field  with
                  something other than null  characters,  always pad
                  with underscores.   Padding allows the user to see
                  exactly how long  an input field is,   but has the
                  disadvantage of preventing the user from using in-
                  sert mode to insert characters in the field.  Pad-
                  ding with underscores may be  used to make a panel
                  more closely resemble a paper form which the panel
                  is replacing.

              9.  Minimize the  use of lengthy  application commands
                  within a dialog.   Panels should  be used to build
                  and issue any lengthy commands.   For example, as-
                  sume the  following command is  used to  perform a
                  search:
0                    SEARCH  TABLE  FIRST(JOHN)   MIDDLE(Q)   LAST(DOE)
                     FOR(EMPLOYEE_NUMBER)
0                 The user should not be required to enter the command.
                  Instead,  the dialog should use  panels to gather the
                  information and  should construct and issue  the com-
                  mand.
0             10. When writing  dialogs to  be used  by non-program-
                  mers,  consider using the word "screen" instead of
                  "panel" in panel text which refers to panels being
                  displayed.   "Screen" is the  correct term for the
                  physical image  displayed on  the terminal  and is
                  also more likely to  be understood by non-program-
                  mers.
0             11. All panels must have a  COMMAND or OPTION field on
                  line 2.  This provides users with a standard place
                  to enter "extended jump" options (e.g. "=3.1") and
                  TSO or CMS commands.
0             12. The last line on the  panel should always be blank
                  to allow  the user to split-screen  without losing
                  any information.
0             13. Use upper and  lower case in text  fields;  it has
                  proven to be more readable  than text which is all
                  in upper case.
0             14. Do not change the default attribute characters un-
                  less  one of  the default  characters must  appear
                  within the text of the panel.
0             15. Identify panels with comments (who,  where,  calls
                  who, called by, etc.)  in the )ATTR section of the
                  panel definition.   See the model  of a panel com-
                  ment block in Figure 14 of Appendix E for an exam-
                  ple.

              16. All panel definitions should  contain all sections
                  - the )ATTR, )BODY, )REINIT, )INIT and )PROC.  Any
                  sections which  are not actually  used by  a panel
                  should be left empty.  Table display panels should
                  also contain a )MODEL section.
0             17. Many installations find that  including a time-of-
                  day field  on every panel  is useful  in debugging
                  problems which occur while  in ISPF.   Also,  some
                  ISPF users find that having  the time displayed on
                  each panel keeps them aware of time spent in a lo-
                  gon session.   If time is  included as part of the
                  installation standard panel  format,  the position
                  of the time field should  be consistent within the
                  installation.   The  recommended position  for the
                  time field is right justified  on line 3.   Line 3
                  is blank  except for the  time field,  and  when a
                  long message is displayed,   the time is automati-
                  cally overlayed  with the message text  or blanks.
                  If date,  userid or other  fields are defined as a
                  panel standard for an installation, their position
                  on the panels should also be consistent within the
                  installation.
0             18. Your installation may want to display the PDF ver-
                  sion number on the Primary Option menu.  This will
                  allow users to  report the version they  are using
                  when ISPF problems are  encountered (in an instal-
                  lation which runs multiple versions of ISPF).  One
                  disadvantage of  displaying the version  number is
                  that users tend to  attribute many unrelated prob-
                  lems to a change in ISPF/PDF  if they are aware of
                  a new version being implemented.

0             1.  The majority of  the panel should be  displayed in
                  low intensity output and in upper and lower case.
0             2.  Do not  overuse high  intensity.   High  intensity
                  draws  attention to  important fields  on a  panel

                  when they contrast with the  majority of the panel
                  fields.   Too much high intensity on a panel mini-
                  mizes this effect.
0             3.  Output fields
0                 a) High intensity - should be used sparingly.  The
                     only universally highlighted  sequence of char-
                     acters are  the title line,  the  command line,
                     and the arrows.
0                 b) Low intensity  - should be the  predominant at-
                     tribute for fields in the body of the panel.
0             4.  Input fields
0                 a) High intensity -  should be used for  all input
                     fields, except for those in table displays.  In
                     the case of table displays  it should always be
                     used with the selection field.  Other important
                     table display  input fields  may also  be high-
                     lighted.
0                 b) Low intensity -  should only be used  for table
                     display input fields.
0             5.  Do not depend on the use of color;  some users may
                  not have a color terminal.  For example:  the fol-
                  lowing instruction would be unclear to users with-
                  out a color terminal:
                       Enter report number on the RED line below:

           General
0             1.  The panel  )BODY section should always  be defined
                  with the  standard number  of lines  which can  be
                  displayed on the terminals  being used (usually 24
                  lines).   This  can minimize the errors  made when
                  adding to an existing panel definition.
0             2.  Each line should begin with  a '+' attribute char-
                  acter unless  some other  attribute is  necessary.
                  This  prevents  unintentional  continuation  of  a
                  field from the previous line.

0             2.  Should  be displayed  in a  high intensity  output
                  field.
0             3.  Should be in upper case.
0             4.  The title should be centered on the title line.
0             5.  Separate the title  from the dashes by  at least 1
                  (and preferably 2) blanks.
0          Command Line (Line 2)
0             1.  Reserved for OPTION ===> or COMMAND ===>.   OPTION
                  should be used on all  selection menus and COMMAND
                  should be used on all other panels.
0             2.  Should be in upper case.
0             3.  Should  be displayed  in a  high intensity  output
                  field.
0             4.  The input field should NOT be terminated until the
                  beginning of the next line,   to allow the user to
                  enter long CMS or TSO commands.
0          Standard Arrow Symbol
0             1.  All input fields should be immediately preceded by
                  the ISPF standard arrow symbol ( ===> ).
0             2.  Should be used ONLY to precede input fields.
0             3.  Should  always be  displayed in  a high  intensity
                  output field.
0             4.  Line  up the  arrows  vertically,  within  logical
                  groups, on the panel.  If possible, line up all of
                  the arrows on  the panel.   The text  fields which
                  precede the arrow symbols should be left-justified
                  within logical groups.

0          Long Message Line (Line 3)
0             1.  Should always be blank.    (Some output fields may
                  be positioned on  this line.   This is  the normal
                  position for a time-of-day field).
0          Function Line (optional, Line 4)
0             1.  Can be used to display a  subtitle on a panel,  if
                  one is necessary.
0             2.  Should be in upper and lower case.
0             3.  Should  be displayed  in a  high intensity  output
                  field.
0             4.  Can be used to  provide simple instructions,  such
                  as "Enter all of the Reports to be Run"
0          Directive Line (Line 22,23)
0             1.  The directive line directs the user on how to pro-
                  ceed from  this panel.   The  wording of  the line
                  should be consistent with ISPF/PDF.
0             2.  To indicate  an action,  display the  following on
                  line 23:
0                 Press ENTER key to process; Enter END command to terminate.
0                 If ENTER and END meanings  are different from nor-
                  mal PDF use, use two lines to display the instruc-
                  tions (this  will help draw  attention to  the in-
                  structions):
0                      Press ENTER key to ----------
                       Enter END command to --------
0                 where dashes indicate action.  For example,

                  on lines 22 and 23.
0             3.  The directive line(s)  should  be in the following
                  format:  the words END and ENTER are in upper case
                  and displayed in high intensity output fields, the
                  rest of the line(s)  should  be in upper and lower
                  case and displayed in low intensity output fields.

           Input fields
0             1.  If it is necessary to  pad input fields with some-
                  thing other than null characters,  always pad with
                  underscores.  (See Section 3.1 for more discussion
                  of this standard).
0             2.  Unused padding  characters should  not need  to be
                  removed by the user (i.e.,  use the PAD keyword in
                  the  )ATTR  section  of the  panel  to  pad  input
                  fields).
0             3.  Should  be displayed  in  a  high intensity  input
                  field.
0             4.  Should be  initialized to either a  previously en-
                  tered value, or a default value, if one can be de-
                  termined.
0             5.  Limit the number of input  fields on a panel.  IBM
                  studies show that  between 12 and 16  input fields
                  per panel is optimal.
0             6.  Input fields should line up vertically,  if at all
                  possible.   This allows the  most effective use of
                  the cursor positioning keys.
0          Information
0             1.  Used to display the possible values for the corre-
                  sponding input field.
0             2.  Should  be displayed  in  a  low intensity  output
                  field.
0             3.  Should be in upper and lower case.
0             4.  Be consistent in the use of displayed values, i.e.
                  either always use Y and N or YES and NO.
0             5.  The recommended values for Yes/No fields are Y and
                  N.

              6.  If there  are only  2 valid  entries for  an input
                  field, list the entries separated by 'or',  i.  e.
                  (Y or N) to be consistent with ISPF/PDF panels.
0             7.  To list more  than two valid entries  for an input
                  field,  separate the items by a comma and a blank.
                  For example, ISPF/PDF Version 2 uses the following
                  format on its 3.4 panel:

           Input Fields

                  field.
0             2.  Should be padded with underscores.
0             3.  Should be organized  so that the user  enters data
                  across a row instead of  down a column.   In other
                  words, logical groupings of data (e.g., data items
                  related to a single record) should be input across
                  a row, not down a column.   The reason for this is
                  that the  cursor can  be moved  across the  screen
                  more easily than it can be moved down the screen.

           General
0             1.  Set &ZUP on every tutorial panel.  This avoids the
                  confusion of determining when  &ZUP is really nec-
                  essary.
0             2.  Wherever necessary, use continuation tutorial pan-
                  els to explain a dialog panel.   Using more panels
                  with less  text per panel  is more  effective than
                  using fewer panels with more text per panel.
0             3.  All dialogs should have an overview topic included
                  in their tutorial.  An overview is useful for ori-
                  enting users who are unfamiliar with the dialog.

           Option Lines
0             1.  Composed of two sections.
0                 a) Option Code
0                    i)    Should be numbers (preferred) or letters.
0                    ii)   Should be  displayed in a  high intensity
                           output field.
0                    iii)  When a  tutorial option corresponds  to a
                           selection menu  option,  the  same option
                           code should be used for both.
0                    iv)   If the characters B, S,  T,  U,  or I are
                           used as  selection options on  a tutorial
                           panel,  the user will not  be able to use
                           them  to specifiy  the tutorial  commands
                           BACK, SKIP, TOP, UP, and INDEX.
0                 b) Option Description
0                    i)    Describes  the specific  area covered  by
                           the tutorial option.
0             2.  Align the option codes and the option descriptions
                  vertically.
0             3.  Put the  options with  the highest  probability of
                  being  chosen at  the top  of the  list to  reduce
                  reading time.   Match the order  of the options to
                  those found  on the corresponding  Selection Menu.
                  If there is still no  obvious pattern for ordering
                  options, put them in alphabetical order.
0          General
0             1.  Set &ZUP on every tutorial panel.  This avoids the
                  confusion of determining when  &ZUP is really nec-
                  essary.

              2.  Use a tutorial hierarchy that  has a logical order
                  (i.e. follows the hierarchy of the dialog).   Ide-
                  ally,  there should  be a minimum of  one tutorial
                  panel for every dialog panel.
0             3.  All dialogs  should have  an overview  topic.   An
                  overview is useful for orienting users who are un-
                  familiar with the dialog.

0          General
0             When a dialog  function executes for a  long time without
              any user interaction (e.g.  when searching a large file),
              an INFORMATORY  panel may be used  to inform the  user of
              the status  of the  processing.   The  panel itself  is a
              standard panel containing only  text fields.   Before the
              panel is displayed,  the CONTROL  service is invoked with
              the DISPLAY and LOCK parameters.   The panel is displayed
              with the keyboard locked and the function continues proc-
              essing without waiting for any user response.
0             Although the user cannot respond to the panel (other than
              by using the  "break" key),  the dialog  has informed the
              user of its status.   An Informatory panel can be used to
              give the  user an  idea of how  much processing  has been
              done and how soon it will be finished.

           3.12   NON-DISPLAY PANEL
+                 ___________ _____
0             Non-Display panels are generally used when the panel lan-
              guage provides a function needed in a CLIST, EXEC or pro-
              gram dialog function.  For example, the VER statement can
              be used to  verify that a variable contains  a valid data
              set name instead of using complicated program code.
0             Non-Display panels are processed  using the DISPLAY serv-
              ice but are not displayed to  the user.   Before the DIS-
              PLAY service is invoked,  the  CONTROL service is invoked
              with the NONDISPL and the ENTER or END parameters.   This
              causes the  panel processing  to be  performed as  if the
              user had pressed the ENTER or  END keys.   When the ENTER
              parameter is specified,  the panel will be displayed with
              a message if .MSG is set  by panel processing.   When the
              END parameter is  specified,  the panel is  not displayed
              even if .MSG is set by panel processing.
0             There are two approaches to  using non-display panels for
              the purpose  of using the  panel language  VER statement.
              The first  approach causes  the non-display  panel to  be
              displayed (with the appropriate error message) if a vari-
              able does not  pass a VER test.   The  CONTROL service is
              invoked with the NONDISPL and ENTER parameters.   In this
              case, the non-display panel should comply with all of the
              general panel  standards because the  panel will  be dis-
              played to the  user if a verification  fails.   The )BODY
              section of the  panel should use the  standard format for
              an Informatory type panel.
0             The  second approach  does  not  display the  non-display
              panel even if a variable fails  a VER test.   The CONTROL
              service is invoked with the  NONDISPL and END parameters.
              In the panel,  the value of .MSG should be examined after
              the VER statement.   If .MSG  is nonblank,  then a dialog
              variable should be set to the  value of .MSG.   When con-
              trol is returned to the dialog function, the function ex-
              amines the value  of the dialog variable  to determine if
              an error occurred.   Following are excerpts from a sample
              non-display panel and  a CLIST dialog function  which use
              this approach.

                                   4.  MESSAGES
0          General guidelines:
0             1.  Use vocabulary which is familiar to the user.
0             2.  Use standard punctuation.
0             3.  Messages should  have a consistent  format.  Place
                  any user action  first in the long  message,  fol-
                  lowed by an explanation of the error or the conse-
                  quences of the action.
0             4.  Use positive statements wherever possible, e.g.
0                      "Select an option from the list below"
                               instead of
                       "Option selected is invalid".
0             5.  Use active rather than passive statements, e.g.
0                      "Enter the name of the data set"
                               instead of
                       "Data set name must be entered"
0             6.  There is a  good article on designing  messages by
                  M.  Dean,  entitled "How a Computer Should Talk to
                  People"  which was  published in  the IBM  Systems
                  Journal (see the bibliography).
0             7.  Do not use CLIST,  EXEC  or program output facili-
                  ties to display messages.   All messages should be
                  displayed using the ISPF message facility.
0          Specific suggestions:
0             1.  Always use  the default  message areas  to display
                  ISPF messages.
0             2.  Messages  should  not  overlay  any  panel  fields
                  (other than text  fields used to  display time-of-
                  day, date or userid).

              3.  Each message should have both short and long text.
0             4.  Always use .ALARM=YES with error messages.
0             5.  Informatory  messages  should   be  used  wherever
                  needed.
0             6.  Put as much  information as possible in  the short
                  message text.
0             7.  The .HELP parameter should  be used whenever there
                  is a specific tutorial panel  which relates to the
                  message.
0             8.  Position the cursor  to the field in  error when a
                  message is displayed;  this helps the user to find
                  and correct the error.
0             9.  Use the value from the field  in error in the long
                  message to increase the informational content (the
                  same value should  be displayed in the  short mes-
                  sage, if possible).
0             10. Use dialog variables in messages  to make the mes-
                  sage more meaningful.   When possible,  the dialog
                  variable should be used in both the short and long
                  message.   For example, an input dialog could dis-
                  play the record number that  was processed as part
                  of the "record processed" short and long messages.
0             11. If processing efficiency is an important consider-
                  ation,  guidelines  may be  established concerning
                  the size of message members.  Message members will
                  be accessed most efficiently if  the total size of
                  the member is kept under the blocksize of the data
                  set.  For example, if the blocksize of the library
                  is 6160 (the recommended  blocksize),  then a mes-
                  sage member of  77 lines (77 x 80 =  6160)  is the
                  maximum that will fit in one block.

                                    5.  TABLES
0          Tables should only  be used for one-to-one  mappings.   ISPF
           tables were designed to provide a way to store,  process and
           display a basic array structure.    Attempts to use ISPF ta-
           bles as  a sophisticated database  will result  in extremely
           complex (and slow) table processing logic.  Do not use a ta-
           ble row as a linked list.
-          Specific suggestions:
0             1.  Do not  redefine the scroll  PF keys  to different
                  functions.  User confidence is undermined when the
                  meanings of the PF keys  change from one dialog to
                  another.
0             2.  If possible,  do not use  extension variables in a
                  table.    The presence of extension variables will
                  add complexity to table processing which will make
                  the dialog  harder to maintain.    Using extension
                  variables in permanent tables  will complicate the
                  logic of every dialog which accesses the table.
0                 Extension variables may be  necessary for display-
                  ing error  or informatory messages within  a table
                  row.
0             3.  Display informative messages  during user process-
                  ing of the table.   When the message is related to
                  a function command, use the ISPF message facility.
                  When the message  is related to a  particular row,
                  display the message in a  column of the table dis-
                  play  which has  been reserved  for that  purpose.
                  For  permanent tables,   this can  be best  accom-
                  plished by using an  extension variable to display
                  the message.   For temporary tables, define a mes-
                  sage field in each row  when the table is created,
                  to avoid the use of extension variables.
0             4.  The first input field in  the table display should
                  be  the leftmost  field.   To  be consistent  with
                  ISPF/PDF table displays,  this  field should start
                  in column 1.

              5.  Emulate  PDF processing  of tables  as closely  as
                  possible (for example,  member  selection lists in
                  PDF option 3.1).
0             6.  A  model for  Table Display  processing should  be
                  made available.  The example and discussion of ta-
                  ble display processing provided in the Dialog Man-
                  agement Services  manual will  not generate  main-
                  tainable and consistent code.   A well-coded model
                  should help encourage correct and consistent table
                  processing across  dialogs developed  by different
                  groups.  See Appendix A for a sample model.
0             7.  The processing  of the command  field can  be done
                  either before or after processing the rows.  There
                  are two advantages to processing the command field
                  after processing the rows:
0                 a) Installation-developed dialogs will be consist-
                     ent with ISPF/PDF dialogs.
0                 b) A set of row modifications  can be made and one
                     "global" command can be entered  as a final act
                     of panel processing.
0                 The advantage of processing  the command field before
                  the rows are processed, is that it allows the command
                  to  affect the  action to  be taken  for all  entered
                  lines.
0                 Because consistent behavior is so important to dialog
                  users,  it is recommended that command field process-
                  ing be done after row processing,  in accordance with
                  ISPF/PDF table  processing.   However,   if a  CANCEL
                  function is  provided by  the dialog,   it should  be
                  processed prior to all row processing (i. e.  no rows
                  are processed).
0             8.  When designing a dialog  which displays tables,  a
                  decision must be made about  the processing of the
                  END and RETURN commands.  When the user enters END
                  or RETURN,  there may  be row modifications and/or
                  application commands which have not yet been proc-

                  essed.  If row processing is NOT done after an END
                  or RETURN  command,  the user  will be  allowed to
                  exit the  table display without  correcting errors
                  which have previously been  detected.   If row and
                  command field  processing IS done  before allowing
                  the END  or RETURN to  take effect,  a  CANCEL (or
                  equivalent)  command  should be provided  to allow
                  the user a chance to abort the operation.
0                 The example of table processing  given in the Dia-
                  log  Management  Services manual  processes  table
                  rows, but not the command field, when the user en-
                  ters the END or RETURN command.   The sample model
                  which appears in Appendix A follows this approach.
0             9.  In general,  production dialogs should not need to
                  include code to handle  table service return codes
                  greater than 8.    Two exceptions to this  are the
                  TBOPEN and the TBQUERY services.  The return codes
                  from these services should be checked to determine
                  whether a table is open.
0             10. Any variable  which is specified  in a  MODEL line
                  but which is not part of  the actual table (as de-
                  fined using the TBCREATE service)  must be cleared
                  before each  re-display of the table.    This pre-
                  vents propagation of the value  of the variable in
                  one row of the table through  each row of the dis-
                  played table.    (This type  of variable  is often
                  used to display a SELECT  CODE field for line com-
                  mands).
0             11. The enqueue mechanism provided by ISPF is intended
                  to prevent  concurrent updating of the  same table
                  by multiple users.   The mechanism is based on the
                  assumption that  all users updating a  given table
                  will have  the same  first library  definition for
                  ISPTLIB.   Dialog  developers should  be aware  of
                  this when designing dialogs which  will be used by
                  concurrent users to update a table.

                                6.  FILE TAILORING
0             1.  Some current uses are the generation of:
0                 JCL, Control Cards,  customized CLIST or EXEC com-
                  mand lists, reports,  SCRIPT input files,  program
                  skeletons, and correspondence.
0             2.  There is  a perceptible amount  of wait  time when
                  file tailoring is performed online; when feasible,
                  perform file tailoring in batch mode.
0             3.  Skeletons should be commented,   just as programs,
                  CLISTs, EXECs and panels should be commented.

                                    7.  MODELS
0             1.  Dialog developers  should be  strongly discouraged
                  from making their own copy of the model menus (IS-
                  REMCMD, ISREMPNL, etc.).   If they do create their
                  own copies of these menus,  they will not have ac-
                  cess to  changes to these  menus made in  new ver-
                  sions of ISPF/PDF or changes made by the installa-
                  tion.     Each  installation   should  provide   a
                  mechanism for users and/or groups to add their own
                  models.  This can be done by adding U (User) and G
                  (Group) options to the model menus accessed by ev-
                  eryone in the installation.  Following are two ap-
                  proaches to  adding models.   The first  method is
                  recommended  because it  does  not complicate  the
                  MODEL command used to  imbed the IBM-supplied mod-
                  els.  Sample model panels to implement each method
                  are provided in Appendix B.
0                 a) Method 1:
0                    Place User and Group options  on the Class menu
                     and User,  Group,  and  Installation options on
                     the model options menu for each class.
0                    Advantages - Standard ISPF  models are accessi-
                        ble  at the  first  level  of the  hierarchy
                        (e.g.  the TBCREATE model can be imbedded in
                        a CLIST using the command 'MODEL TBCREATE').
0                    Disadvantages  -  User models  are  placed  one
                        level lower  in the  hierarchy than  the IBM
                        models.
0                 b) Method 2:
0                    Insert a menu  between the Class menu  and each
                     of the  option menus.    On the  inserted menu,
                     place options  for ISPF services  and Installa-
                     tion, Group and User options.
0                    Advantages - All model options  are at the same
                        level in the hierarchy;  the model hierarchy
                        can be organized more logically.

                     Disadvantages  - The  command used  to imbed  a
                        model into  a data  set (without  displaying
                        the  model  menus)  requires  an  additional
                        qualifier  to  identify  which  section  the
                        model belongs to (ISPF, Installation,  Group
                        or User).  For example: the command required
                        to imbed the TBCREATE  model would be  MODEL
                        1.TBCREATE if IBM-supplied  ISPF models were
                        option 1.   Also,  if users are not familiar
                        with which models are  IBM-supplied ISPF and
                        which are  'home-grown',  they  may have  to
                        search one  section before  discovering that
                        it is contained in  the other.   This search
                        may be frustrating because  an 'END' command
                        on  any  model menu  terminates  the  entire
                        MODEL command.
0             2.  Within the  skeleton member,  NOTEs should  be in-
                  cluded to explain any options or parameters avail-
                  able to the user or areas which need to be custom-
                  ized by  the user.    The text  within NOTE  lines
                  should be in mixed upper and lower case to improve
                  readablility.
0             3.  All models which are longer  than ten lines should
                  begin with  a NOTE  that explains  the use  of the
                  model.

                 8.  USING DIALOG MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN PROGRAMS
0             1.  Specifying the lengths to VCOPY and VREPLACE:
0                 Use one  array for each set  of data to  be moved.
                  Before the service is invoked,  store the array in
                  a "temporary" array  and use this as  the argument
                  to the service.   This technique  has been used in
                  ISPF dialog  functions which display  many panels.
                  VCOPY and VREPLACE  are used to move  data between
                  the function pool and program variables.
0                 Example (using PL/I):
0                    DCL TMP_ARRAY(4) FIXED BIN(31),
                         LENGTHS1(4)  FIXED BIN(31) INIT(4,4,2,0);
                     ...
                     initialize BUFFER with data to be displayed
                     ...
                     TMP_ARRAY = LENGTHS1;
                     CALL ISPLINK('VREPLACE','(name list)',
                                  TMP_ARRAY,BUFFER);
                     ...
                     display a panel to allow user to modify data
                     ...
                     TMP_ARRAY = LENGTHS1;
                     CALL ISPLINK('VCOPY   ', '(name list)',
                                  TMP_ARRAY, BUFFER, 'MOVE');
                     ...
                     process data entered on panel
                     ...
0                 This method has two advantages:  the length array can
                  be initialized in  one line of code  and the original
                  length  values are  not written  over  by the  dialog
                  service.
0             2.  Saving the return code from an ISPF service:
0                 Immediately after each dialog  service call,  save
                  the return code value in a program variable.  This
                  is necessary to:
-
                                            - 42 -

-
                  a) prevent the  return code value from  being lost
                     (overwritten by another call).
0                 b) allow the  return code to  be printed  when the
                     program is being debugged.
0                 c) allow  the return  code to  be  displayed in  a
                     panel or ISPF message (if the variable has been
                     VDEFINEd).
0             3.  Using CLIST or EXEC in dialog development:
0                 a) Develop and debug the  display processing using
                     a CLIST or EXEC first.
0                    It is generally easier to use the CLIST or EXEC
                     language to develop and debug dialog functions.
                     During  development  and design  review,   many
                     changes are made to  dialog functions.   Dialog
                     functions coded in CLIST or  EXEC are much eas-
                     ier to  change than  functions which  are coded
                     using languages which must be compiled.
0                 b) Convert the  CLIST or EXEC dialog  functions to
                     programs.
0                    When the design of the dialog function has sta-
                     bilized, the function may be coded using a pro-
                     gramming language for more efficient execution,
                     or for the arithmetic,   string-handling or I/O
                     facilities provided by a programming language.
0                 c) Finish all further processing in the program.
0                    Special care  should be  taken with  regards to
                     CLIST/EXEC function  variables which  were used
                     in panels, messages, or skeletons.  The program
                     does not  share any variables with  ISPF unless
                     specifically stated in a VDEFINE.

              4.  Using models:
0                 Use the  available models for invoking  the dialog
                  services.  Develop additional  models for declara-
                  tions of ISPLINK (ISPLNK)  and any standard varia-
                  bles or modules used by ISPF dialog programs.
0             5.  LOADing versus LINKing the ISPLINK module:
0                 Programs which use ISPF services  may load the IS-
                  PLINK module or the program may be linkedited with
                  ISPLINK.    A language-dependent  facility may  be
                  used to load the ISPLINK  program at the beginning
                  of each program-based dialog and  delete it at the
                  end.   This dynamic call of ISPLINK will allow for
                  the installation  of new versions of  ISPF without
                  relinking all of the programs  that use ISPF serv-
                  ices in the installation.
0                 For example, in a PL/I program,  the FETCH and RE-
                  LEASE statements could be used:
0                              FETCH...
                               ...
                               CALL ISPLINK...
                               ...
                               CALL ISPLINK...
                               ...
                               CALL ISPLINK...
                               ...
                               RELEASE...
0                 The  disadvantages of  using  a  dynamic call  are
                  higher overhead and greater  difficulty in problem
                  determination.   Also, excessive memory usage, I/O
                  overhead and elapsed time may be caused by failure
                  to RELEASE the module due  to program logic errors
                  or ABENDs.
0                 If a dynamic call facility is not used,  or is not
                  available, then the ISPLINK module must be linked-
                  ited in with the programs that call it.   New ver-
                  sions of ISPF may require  that all programs which
-                                           - 44 -

-
-
                  are linkedited with ISPLINK be linked with the new
                  version of the module.
0             6.  Using the VDEFINE service:
0                 a) Use the same variable name  in both the program
                     and on the ISPF panel.    This is not required;
                     however,  it will make  the application program
                     easier to debug and maintain.
0                 b) When the variable being VDEFINEd corresponds to
                     a panel input  field,  make sure the  length of
                     the panel input field is the same as the length
                     of the variable in the application program.  If
                     the length of the program variable is less than
                     the  length of  the  corresponding panel  input
                     field, a dialog error will result when the user
                     enters  a value  whose length  is greater  than
                     that of the program variable.
0                 c) Code an  internal subroutine  or perform  para-
                     graph that  contains VDEFINE  calls for  all of
                     the variables that will be  VDEFINEd by the ap-
                     plication program.  This section of code should
                     parallel a corresponding  VDELETE subroutine or
                     perform paragraph (which should  be executed at
                     the end of the program).
0                 d) The following  subroutine may  be used  by PL/I
                     programs to  reduce the  margin for  error when
                     calling the VDEFINE function  to define charac-
                     ter data.  This subroutine reduces the complex-

                     CALL VDEFSUB('VARX',VARX);
0             7.  Using the VDELETE service:
0                 a) Code an  internal subroutine  or perform  para-
                     graph that  contains VDELETE  calls for  all of
                     the variables  that have  been VDEFINEd  by the
                     application  program.    This section  of  code
                     should  parallel  a corresponding  VDEFINE  su-
                     broutine or perform paragraph.
0                 b) The following  subroutine may  be used  by PL/I
                     programs to  reduce the  margin for  error when
                     calling the VDELETE function.    Using this su-
                     broutine reduces the complexity of the call and
                     should reduce testing time and errors.
0                    /* start of subroutine */
                     VDELSUB: PROC(NAME) OPTIONS(REENTRANT) REORDER;

                     CALL VDELSUB('VARX');
0             8.  Using the ISPEXEC call format:
0                 Use the  call format of  ISPEXEC in  program func-
                  tions which are being  converted from CLISTs (this
                  facility was made available in ISPF V.  2).   This
                  should decrease  the effort required to  convert a
                  dialog function  from CLIST or  EXEC to  a progam.
                  Also,  the ISPEXEC format is more readable because
                  of the use of keyword parameters.
0                 Example of ISPEXEC format in a CLIST:
                      ISPEXEC DISPLAY PANELX MSG(MSG001)
0                 Example of ISPLINK call format (in a PL/I program):
                      CALL ISPLINK ('DISPLAY', 'PANELX', 'MSG001')
0                 Example of ISPEXEC call format (in a PL/I program):
                       ...set BUFFER_LNGTH equal to 26...
                      CALL ISPEXEC (BUFFER_LNGTH,'DISPLAY PANELX MSG(MSG001)');

             9.  USER CUSTOMIZATION OF SYSTEM-WIDE DIALOG COMPONENTS
0             Dialog developers should be strongly discouraged from ov-
              erriding system-wide dialog components with their custom-
              ized version of  these components.   When ISPF  users are
              allowed to override system-wide components,  two problems
              occur:
0                1.  System-wide components are  inadvertently over-
                     ridden by  users,  resulting  in dialog  errors
                     which can be difficult to diagnose.
0                2.  When modifications  are made  to dialog  compo-
                     nents in the system-wide  libraries,  the user-
                     customized  components  prevent the  user  from
                     seeing new or enhanced features.  The most com-
                     mon examples  of this are  user-customized Pri-
                     mary Option menus.   A user overriding the Pri-
                     mary  Option  menu  is unaware  of  changes  or
                     additions which have  been made in the  menu in
                     the system-wide libraries.
0             A program which front-ends the ISPF command processor can
              be used  to enforce a  concatenation sequence  which your
              installation has defined as standard.   The following al-
              gorithm describes  the program  for the  TSO environment.
              (Sample code for the program is given in Appendix C).
0                1.  GETMAIN a save area for  system services to use
                     while  this  program  is  executing.    Perform
                     standard chaining of the save areas.
0                2.  Verify that the user is in TSO (non-JOB)  mode.
                     Do not  enforce concatenations  for batch  ISPF
                     sessions.
0                3.  Find the TIOT for the TSO User.
0                4.  For each DD entry in the TIOT:
0                    a) Search the table of ISPF ddnames (this table
                        has  been initialized  in  the program  data
                        area).   Each entry in the table contains an

                        ISPF ddname  and the  name of  the data  set
                        which must be first in the concatenation ac-
                        cording to installation standards.
0                    b) If the ddname  from the TIOT entry  is found
                        in the  table,  compare  the first  data set
                        name in the concatenation (in the JFCB) with
                        the data set name in the table entry.
0                    c) If the data set names do not match,  write a
                        message to the  user and set the  error flag
                        to indicate that ISPF should not be invoked.
0                5.  FREEMAIN the save area.
0                6.  Check the error flag.  If it has been set,  re-
                     turn to the  caller.   If it has  not been set,
                     load up the caller's  registers,  get the entry
                     point of the  ISPF command processor in  REG 15
                     (GPR15) and go to the processor.

                 10.  CONCATENATION SEQUENCES FOR ISPF LIBRARIES
-
0          10.1   GENERAL
+                 _______
0          A standard concatenation sequence  for ISPF libraries should
           be established by each installation.    For purposes of this
           discussion, we have identified four categories of libraries:
0             1.  IBM-supplied ISPF and/or ISPF/PDF libraries
0             2.  System  wide applications  (Installation-developed
                  and Vendor)
0             3.  Group  applications   (Installation-developed  and
                  Vendor)
0             4.  User applications (Installation-developed and Ven-
                  dor).
0          In each category,  there are two possible types of libraries
           -- installation developed and vendor purchased.   Vendor li-
           braries are often part of the system-wide category,  but may
           also exist in the group and  user categories for the follow-
           ing business reasons:
0             1.  Only one group  needs access to a  particular ven-
                  dor-supplied application.
0             2.  One group  has purchased  its own  vendor-supplied
                  application and does not want  anyone else to have
                  access to it.
0             3.  One group has purchased  a proprietary application
                  and is restricted by the licensing agreement to be
                  the only users of the application.

           10.3   COMBINING ISPF LIBRARIES FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES
+                 _________ ____ _________ ____ _________ _______
0          For each  category of libraries  (system wide,   group,  and
           user),  the Installation-developed libraries  and Vendor li-
           braries may be combined in a single library.   There are ad-
           vantages and disadvantages to  combining these libraries for
           any category.
0          Advantages of combining libraries:
0             1.  The overall  directory search is faster  (there is
                  only one directory to search).

                  to read).

           Disadvantages of combining libraries:
0             1.  A test  library must be  concatenated in  front of
                  the production library  to test a new  version (if
                  it  is substituted,   other  applications will  be
                  lost).
0             2.  There is the possibility  of a 'fall-through' dur-
                  ing test (a dialog component which is missing from
                  the test  library is  fetched from  the production
                  library instead of the test library).
0             3.  Obsolete members  remain in  the combined  library
                  when a replacement  version of a library  from one
                  source is merged into  the combined library.   The
                  maintenance staff must  determine which components
                  are no longer used and  manually delete these mem-
                  bers.
0          Advantages of separate libraries:
0             1.  A simple substitution of libraries (test for prod-
                  uction)  allows a new version  of a single library
                  to be tested.
0          Disadvantages of separate libraries:
0             1.  There is a performance  degradation with each suc-
                  cessive library in the concatenation.

                    11.  TRACKING CHANGES IN ISPF AND ISPF/PDF
0             Some suggested approaches:
0                1.  Make all  mods to  IBM-supplied modules  in IBM
                     libraries.  (This approach assumes that IBM li-
                     braries  are  first in  the  concatenation  se-
                     quence).   SMP MUST be used  to perform all al-
                     terations in IBM supplied  libraries.   (SMP is
                     an IBM  program that  can keep  track of  every
                     message,  module,  panel,  etc.   in the system
                     along with all changes made to them).
0                2.  When IBM mods are applied,  make the SMP target
                     library different from  the production library.
                     Have a set  of test procedures to  evaluate the
                     changes.  An advantage of using a separate test
                     library is that  the changes can be  tested be-
                     fore being made production.   A disadvantage of
                     the method is that code that is not part of the
                     SMP supported  libraries could get out  of sync
                     with the rest of the dialog.
0                3.  SMP may not be used to track changes if librar-
                     ies  from  other sources  are  concatenated  in
                     front of the IBM-supplied ISPF and ISPF/PDF li-
                     braries.   Manual inspection or  a text compare
                     program may  be used to detect  differences be-
                     tween different versions of members.
0                4.  Use an  ISPF panel-driven  dialog which  uses a
                     library database manager such as FOCUS or RAMIS
                     to track the changes.
0                5.  Use a Data Dictionary  facility to provide com-
                     prehensive cross-reference, documentation,  and
                     problem and change control for applications.

                         12.  STEPS OF DIALOG DEVELOPMENT
0          A method for developing ISPF dialogs is outlined below:
0             1.  Determine what information the  user needs to sup-
                  ply and what information the  dialog can derive or
                  obtain from some other  source.   Also,  determine
                  which user input values  should be retained across
                  ISPF sessions.   The output of this step should be
                  a rough description of the structure of the dialog
                  - how many panels will be necessary, what informa-
                  tion each panel will retrieve,  and a general idea
                  of the processing  which will be required  to per-
                  form the user's task (program to be executed,  job
                  to be submitted, etc.).
0             2.  Design the panel layouts.
0                 Verify  that the  panels get  all the  information
                  which the user must supply to the dialog.  Concen-
                  trate on how the panels look to the user.   Do the
                  panels have the standard format or "look" of other
                  ISPF  panels?    Consistent formats  minimize  the
                  learning curve  for using new  applications effec-
                  tively and increase user confidence.
0             3.  Create the panels.
0                 Create the panel )BODY sections.   Use the DISPLAY
                  option of Dialog Test to review their format.
0             4.  Develop the  )INIT and )PROC  sections in  each of
                  the panels.    Review the panel layout  and "flow"
                  with the user.
0             5.  Write a rough  draft of each function  executed in
                  the dialog.
0                 In general,   we recommend  that the  functions be
                  coded first as CLISTs or  EXECs.   The changes re-
                  quired during  debugging and design review  can be
                  implemented  easier and  faster in  CLIST or  EXEC
                  code than in a programming language.

              6.  Test the rough draft functions using the FUNCTIONS
                  Dialog Test option.
0             7.  Complete the  validation and  error processing  in
                  the functions.
0                 Code  validation and  error  processing to  ensure
                  that there is not any user action which will cause
                  the dialog to ABEND.  Code the necessary error and
                  informatory messages.
0                 Verify that  the validation code is  working prop-
                  erly  and that  all  messages  are displayed  cor-
                  rectly.
0             8.  Create the tutorial panels for the dialog.
0             9.  Convert CLISTs to programs.
0                 This step is optional;  it may or may not be cost-
                  effective,  depending on the  dialog.   Many func-
                  tions can  be dramatically  improved in  execution
                  time or  validation capabilities if they  are con-
                  verted from CLISTs to programs.
0          There are two papers from  past GUIDE Proceedings which con-
           tain more extensive information  on ISPF Dialog Development.
           They are:
0             1.  GUIDE 56, Session No. MP-57, "ISPF Dialog Manager:
                  Hazards and Pitfalls."

                  opment Methods".

                                   13.  CLISTS
0             1.  CLISTs should  be invoked  by prefixing  a percent
                  sign (%) to the CLIST name:
0                      %clistname
0                 If the percent sign is not used to invoke a CLIST,
                  line mode display  is initiated and the  screen is
                  cleared.
0             2.  Global variables which exist  when ISPF is started
                  are not  available to  CLISTs running  under ISPF.
                  These global variables are restored when ISPF ter-
                  minates.   Global  variables which are  created in
                  CLISTs running  under ISPF  are deleted  when ISPF
                  terminates.
0             3.  ATTN  exits should  not be  used  in ISPF  CLISTs;
                  their use will cause unpredictable results.
0             4.  The TERMIN command procedure statement is not sup-
                  ported under ISPF.
0             5.  Use ISPF file tailoring or PDF EDIT Macros instead
                  of TSO EDIT to format output data sets (JCL, input
                  files, control cards, etc.).

                          14.  NEW APPLICATION PROFILES
0          When a user invokes a NEWAPPL dialog for the first time, the
           ISPSPROF member is  copied from the ISPTLIB file  to the new
           profile member.   This  member of the ISPTLIB  file contains
           the installation defaults for ISPF system profile variables.
           Many ISPF/PDF users change the meaning of their PF keys once
           they are familiar with ISPF/PDF.    These users are confused
           by the change in the values of their PF keys for the NEWAPPL
           dialogs.   A technique  for resetting the user's  PF keys to
           the user's  ISPF/PDF default values  when the dialog  is in-
           voked is described below.
-          To invoke a NEWAPPL dialog:
0             1.  Invoke  a standard  CLIST  (called SAVPFKEY  here)
                  with NEWAPPL(ISR).   Pass SAVPFKEY the name of the
                  panel,  CLIST or program  which begins the dialog,
                  the NEWAPPL ID and any  parameters to be passed to
                  the CLIST or program.
0             2.  SAVPFKEY performs file tailoring on a CLIST skele-
                  ton.  The file  tailoring output is a  CLIST which
                  assigns the  PF key  values from  the ISR  profile
                  pool to the PF key variables.  This CLIST is saved
                  (it is not executed until step 4).
0             3.  SAVPFKEY invokes a second  CLIST (called SETPFKEY)
                  with NEWAPPL and the NEWAPPL  ID specified for the
                  dialog.   SAVPFKEY passes all  other parameters on
                  to SETPFKEY.
0             4.  SETPFKEY executes the file tailored CLIST, setting
                  the  PF key  variables  to  their ISRPROF  values.
                  SETPFKEY then invokes the panel, CLIST, or program
                  which begins the dialog.
0          See Appendix D  for sample code for the  CLISTs SAVPFKEY and
           SETPFKEY and the CLIST skeleton.

           If dialogs in  your installation assign their  own values to
           PF keys,  the code in Appendix  D should be changed to check
           for the  existence of the  NEWAPPL profile member.    If the
           member already exists,   the PF keys should not  be reset to
           the user's ISPF/PDF values.

           Method 1:
              Add Group  and User options on  the Class menu  and User,
              Group and Installation options on  the model option menus
              for each class.
0             The Model Class  Menu in Figure 1 provides a  Group and a
              User Class option to allow groups  and users to add their
              own classes.   If option 1 (CLIST class) is selected, the
              Command Models menu (Figure 2) is displayed.  The Command
              Models menu provides an Installation,  a Group and a User
              models option.   If the  Installation option is selected,
              the Installation Command Models menu  (Figure 3)  is dis-
              played.   The model to be  imbedded is selected from this
              menu.

           Method 2:
              Insert a  menu between  the Class  menu and  each of  the
              model option menus.  On the inserted menu, add the Group,
              User and Installation options.

           lac of First National Bank of  Chicago.   These models are a
           few of the many models which are in use there.   Some of the
           program and  CLIST models included here  display information
           to the user via program or  CLIST I/O.   When the program or
           CLIST is moved into a production environment,  this informa-
           tion should be communicated to the user via ISPF messages or
           panels.
