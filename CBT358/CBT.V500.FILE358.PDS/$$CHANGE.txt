 $$CHANGE

     THIS MEMBER DESCRIBES THE CHANGES TO THE  'SOUTSYS'
     PRODUCTION BROWSE SERVICE ROUTINES (4.S).



    APR  2003  MODIFIED INSTALLATION PROCESS.



    SEPT 1986  ADDED CODE TO SOUTSUB TO DETECT THAT ALL THE DATA IS
               NOT WRITTEN TO THE ACTIVE FILE. THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE
               OF BLOCKING OF THE ACTIVE FILE. A WARNING MESSAGE
               WILL BE PLACED ON THE OUTPUT FROM 4.S STATING THAT
               ALL THE DATA WAS NOT RETRIEVED AND TO RUN THE FLUSH
               PROGRAM OR WAIT FOR ANOTHER JOB TO WRITE.



    SEPT 1986  ADDED CODE TO SOUTSUB TO PUT MESSAGES TO THE
               3480 TAPE DRIVES DURING SEARCHES.
               (USES THE DEVTTYPE AND MSGDISP MVS MACROS)


               (NOTE: MEMBER SOUTSUBO  DOES NOT CONTAIN THE 3480 CODE)




    NOV  1986  ADDED CODE TO SOUTCLN TO DELETE ALL VSAM JOURNAL RECORDS
               THAT POINT TO THE ACTIVE FILE. IF A //DELACT DD CARD IS
               PRESENT, THE RECORDS ARE DELETED.
               THIS WAS NEEDED BECAUSE THE JOURNAL WAS OUT OF SYNC WITH
               THE ACTIVE BECAUSE SOMEONE STARTED DISKWTR WITHOUT FIRST
               RUNNING SAVEWTR. THE ACTIVE FILE WAS OVERLAID AND THEREFORE
               THERE WERE RECORDS IN THE JOURNAL POINTING TO THE ACTIVE
               FOR RECORDS THAT WERE NOT REALLY THERE. ALSO, CLEANWTR
               NEVER DELETED ACTIVE RECORDS BECAUSE THEY NEVER MET THE
               DATE RETENTION PERIOD.
                TO USE THIS FEATURE:
                    1)  RUN SAVEWTR FIRST AND DO NOT RE-START DISKWTR.
                        THIS WILL CLEAR OUT THE CURRENT ACTIVE FILE.
                    2)  ADD A //DELACT DD  CARD TO THE CLEANWTR PROC.
                        (DSN=&&X,DISP=(,DELETE),UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,0)
                    3)  RUN CLEANWTR
                        THIS WILL DELETE ANY VSAM RECORD STILL POINTING TO
                        THE ACTIVE FILE.
                        SAVEWTR AND DISKWTR SHOULD THEN RESTART
                    4)  TAKE OUT THE //DELACT DD CARD
