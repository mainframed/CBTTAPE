     THIS MEMBER DESCRIBES THE FUNCTION AND USE OF THE 'SOUTSYS'
     PRODUCTION BROWSE SERVICE ROUTINES (4.S).





     FUNCTION: THESE ROUTINES ALLOW AN INSTALLATION TO DIRECT
               THE OUTPUT FROM PRODUCTION BATCH JOBS TO A DISK
               DATASET AND RETRIEVE THE JOB OUTPUT ON DEMAND
               VIA TSO USING SPF FULL-SCREEN BROWSE OR OPTIONALLY
               SUBMIT A BATCH JOB TO RETRIEVE THE DATA.
               ADDITIONALLY, IT PROVIDES FOR ARCHIVAL OF THE
               SYSOUT DATA FOR A USER DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME
               VIA TAPE GENERATION DATASETS.





     THIS FILE IS INPUT TO IEBUPDTE 'AS IS'.  TO USE, CREATE A
     PARTITIONED DATASET (FIXED-80) AND EXECUTE IEBUPDTE
     TO CREATE THE MEMBERS DEFINED BELOW.

               DISKWTR  THIS IS A 'STARTABLE' PROCEDURE THAT
                        EXECUTES THE JES2 'EXTERNAL WTR' ROUTINE.
                        OUTPUT IS DIRECTED TO A DISK DATASET
                        (USER DEFINED) TO ALLOW THE SYSOUT
                        TO BE AVAILABLE ON DEMAND BY TSO USERS.
                        IT ALSO DETERMINES IF THE ACTIVE DATASET
                        IS MORE THAN 80% FULL AND AUTOMATICALLY
                        STOPS THE DISKWTR PROC AND
                        STARTS THE SAVEWTR PROC

               FLUSH    THIS IS A 'STARTABLE' PROCEDURE THAT CAN BE
                        USED TO FILL THE LAST BLOCK OF DATA ON THE
                        ACTIVE FILE WHILE DISKWTR IS RUNNING.
                        1) BECAUSE OF THE BLKSIZE OF THE ACTIVE FILE,
                           THE LAST BLOCK IS NOT WRITTEN TO THE ACTIVE
                           FILE UNTIL IT IS FULL
                        2) IF THAT JOB IS SELECTED IN "4.S" THE WHOLE
                           JOB IS NOT RETRIEVED.
                        3) RUN "FLUSH" TO FILL THE LAST BLOCK
                        4) RE-SELECT THE JOB IN 4.S


               SAVEWTR  THIS IS A STARTABLE PROCEDURE THAT WILL:
                        1) INSURES THAT THE DISKWTR IS INACTIVE
                        2) COPIES THE ACTIVE DISK DATASET TO:
                           TAPE OR DISK. IF COPIED TO DISK, OLD
                           DISK DATASETS ARE COPIED TO TAPE.
                        3) REFORMATS THE DISK-DATASET WHEN COMPLETE
                        3) RESTARTS THE DISKWTR ROUTINE
                        4) GENERATES A REPORT LISTING THE JOBS,
                           STEPS, RETCODES, AND TAPE VOLUMES FOR
                           THE JOBS COPIED TO TAPE.
                   NOTE: ALWAYS START DISKWTR BY STARTING SAVEWTR
                         (SAVEWTR WILL START DISKWTR)

              CLEANWTR  THIS IS A STARTABLE PROCEDURE THAT WILL:
                        1) INSURE THAT THE DISKWTR IS INACTIVE
                        2) DELETES OLD VSAM RECORDS FROM THE VSAM
                           JOURNAL.
                        3) DELETES VSAM RECORDS THAT POINT TO NON-
                           EXISTING SYSOUT DATASETS/TAPES.
                           (IE: IF YOU WOULD UNCATALOG A SYSOUT TAPE
                                BEFORE RUNNING THIS PROC)
                        4) DYNAMICALLY DELETES EMPTY DAILY/ARCHIVE
                           DATASETS
                        5) GENERATES A REPORT OF LARGE SYSOUT REPORTS.
                        6) REORGS THE VSAM JOURNAL
                        7) WILL OPTIONALLY DELETE ALL VSAM RECORDS POINTING
                           TO THE ACTIVE FILE (NEEDED IF DISKWTR WAS
                           STARTED WITHOUT RUNNING SAVEWTR FIRST)
                           A "//DELACT DD" CARD IS NEEDED

               SOUTWTR  IS THE ROUTINE EXECUTED BY THE 'SAVEWTR' PROC.
                        IT IS USED TO PREFORM THE FOLLOWING:
                          1) FORMAT A NEW ACTIVE DISK DATASET
                          2) REBUILD THE VSAM JOURNAL IF IT IS
                             DESTROYED
                          3) READ AN INPUT DATASET AND CREATE A NEW
                             TAPE AND UPDATE THE JOURNAL
                             (IE: USED FOR A SNAPPED TAPE)
                          4) COPY THE ACTIVE FILE TO A DAILY TAPE
                          5) COPY THE ACTIVE FILE TO A DAILY DISK
                             AND COPY OLD DAILY DISKS TO AN ARCHIVE
                             TAPE.

               SOUTSEP  IS THE EXTERNAL WRITER JOB-SEPARATOR ROUTINE.
                        IT'S FUNCTION IS TO PLACE UNIQUE 'SOUT
                        SEPARATORS' IN THE OUTPUT FILE TO DELIMIT JOB
                        OUTPUT AND TO CREATE A VSAM "JOURNAL" RECORD
                        FOR EACH. IT ALSO SENSES WHEN THE ACTIVE
                        FILE IS 80% FULL AND STARTS THE SAVEWTR
                        JOB. IF YOU ARE NOT USING SAVEWTR AS THE
                        STARTED TASKS NAME, MODIFY THIS PROGRAM
                        TO POINT TO THE PROPER NAME.

               SOUTSUB  IS CALLED FROM THE TSO PROGRAM (CMNFS00) OR
                        FROM THE BATCH SOUTPRT PROGRAM. IT IS USED
                        TO OBTAIN THE RECORDS FROM THE VSAM JOURNAL
                        AND/OR TO RETRIEVE SPECIFIED SYSOUT LISTINGS.

               SOUTCALL USED BY THE SPF PROGRAM (CMNFS00) TO
                        AUTHORIZE A TSO USER FOR A TAPE MOUNT.

               SOUTCLN  USED BY THE CLEANWTR PROC TO CLEAN UP
                        OLD VSAM JOURNAL RECORDS AND DELETE EMPTY
                        DATASETS. OPTIONALLY REPORT ON LARGE
                        SYSOUT REPORTS.

               SOUTCPR  IS THE COMPRESSION ROUTINE USED TO COMPRESS
                        DATA WHEN COPYING FROM THE ACTIVE TO THE
                        DAILY DISK OR TAPE DATASETS. IT ALSO PERFORMS
                        THE DE-COMPRESSION FOR BROWSING.

               SOUTDATE IS THE ROUTINE USED TO GET A DATE BASED
                        ON A NUMBER OF DAYS YOU WANT TO BACKUP.

               SOUTPRT  IS USED WHEN A USER SUBMITS A BATCH JOB
                        TO PRINT A SYSOUT LISTING.

               SOUTXIT  IS USED BY THE SAVEWTR PROGRAM TO REPORT
                        ON JOBS CONTAINED IN THE ACTIVE DISK-DATASET.

               SOUTCVT  IS THE PROGRAM TO CONVERT YOUR OLD JOURNAL
                        DATASETS TO THE NEW VSAM RECORD FORMAT.
                        (ONLY USED IF YOU ARE CONVERTING)

               LOCINDEX IS A ROUTINE EXTRACTED FROM THE LISTSPC
                        PROGRAM. IT IS USED IN SOUTCLN AND SOUTWTR
                        TO OBTAIN DATASET NAMES IN THE SOUT SYSTEM.

               CMNFS00,CMNFS00A,CMNFS00B,CMNFS00C,CMNFS00D,CMNFS00E
               CMNFS01,CMNFS02,CMNFS03
                        PANELS USED IN THE SPF 4.S SYSTEM
                        THEY SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE SPF PANELS DATASET.

               CMNFSKEL IS THE SKELETON JCL TO BE ADDED TO THE SPF
                        SKELETON LIBRARY AS MEMBER CMNFS00.

               CMNFS00@ IS THE TSO/ISPF PROGRAM THAT IS INVOKED
                        UNDER THE 4.S SPF SESSION. IT'S FUNCTION
                        IS TO LIST ALL THE ENTRIES FOR A JOB (SPF TABLE)
                        OR TO LOCATE A NAMED JOB IN THE SOUT SUBSYSTEM
                        DATASETS AND COPY IT TO A USER DATASET.  ONCE
                        COPIED, THE SPF BROWSE ROUTINE IS CALLED
                        TO ALLOW FULL-SCREEN BROWSING OF THE SYSOUT.
                        IT CAN ALSO SUBMIT A BATCH JOB TO RETRIEVE
                        THE SYSOUT REPORT.
                        IT SOULD BE NAMED 'CMNFS00' IN YOUR LIBRARY.


     INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS:

                 1) MODIFY THE SOUT SYSTEM SOURCE AS FOLLOWS:
                      SOUTCALL- INCLUDE 'MVSGPSVC' NUMBER IF USERS
                                ARE ALLOWED TO REQUEST TAPE MOUNTS
                                FOR ARCHIVE TAPES (OR MAKE IT
                                AUTHORIZED ANOTHER WAY).

                      DISKWTR, SAVEWTR, CLEANWTR
                                MODIFY THE PREFIX "DD" (SYS2.OPSWTR) TO
                                YOUR STANDARDS. THIS IS USED AS A LOCK
                                DATASET AND ALSO BY THE SOUTWTR AND
                                SOUTCLN PROGRAMS AS A HIGH LEVEL PREFIX
                                FOR OBTAINING DATASET NAMES.
                                THE DISKWTR PROC MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE
                                CLASS TO BE USED.

                                (IN SAVEWTR, CHANGE //OLDPFX TO YOUR

                                MODIFY CMNFSWTR = SYS2.OPSWTR  TO
                                YOUR STANDARDS
                                MODIFY CMNFSWTO = SYS2.OPSTAPE TO
                                POINT TO YOUR OLD SYSOUT PREFIX
                                (ONLY USED IF YOU ARE CONVERTING;
                                 DELETE IF YOU ARE A NEW USER)

                 2) ASSEMBLE AND LINK THE PROGRAMS INTO LINKLIST DS.
                    ASSEMBLE AND LINK CMNFS00 INTO YOUR SPF LOAD DS.
                    (APPLY OPTIONAL XWTRZAP IF YOU WISH)

                 3) CREATE THE 'ACTIVE' DISKWTR DATASET ON A
                    RESIDENT VOLUME (ABOUT 50-100 CYLS).
                    **MUST** BE ON A CYL BOUNDRY
                    USE JOB "FORMAT"

                 4) CREATE THE 'JOURNAL' VSAM  DATASET.
                    ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF JOBS YOU MIGHT HOLD
                    IN THE SYSTEM AND CHANGE THE RECORD COUNT
                    IN JOB 'INITJRNL'. THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ONE
                    ENTRY IN THE FILE. THIS JOB WILL CREATE IT.
                    IT WILL BE DELETED IN THE FIRST RUN OF CLEANWTR.

                 5) INSTALL THE 'DISKWTR', 'SAVEWTR' AND 'CLEANWTR'
                    PROCS IN IN 'SYS1.PROCLIB' AND START DISKWTR.

                 6) INSTALL THE NINE PANELS INTO THE ISPPLIB DATASET
                    AND UPDATE THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU AS WELL.

                 7) INSTALL THE CMNFSKEL IN THE SPF ISPSLIB DATASET
                    AS MEMBER CMNFS00.

                    ----- INSTALLED -----

                 9) START THE "DISKWTR" STARTED TASK
                10) PRODUCE SYSOUT (CORRECT MSGCLASS) TO GENERATE
                    JOB(S) IN THE DISKWTR CLASS.
                11) USE SPF '4.S' TO BROWSE SELECTED JOBS (AND/OR
                    NON-MSGCLASS SYSOUT (HELP IS AVAILABLE).
                12) DETERMINE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP SOME REPORTS
                    ONLINE OR ALWAYS GO TO TAPE. UPDATE THE
                    SAVEWTR PROC PARMS TO REFLECT YOUR CHOICE.
                13) START THE 'SAVEWTR' PROC - "S SAVEWTR"
                    TO BUILD THE FIRST DAILY DATASET.
                    IT WILL RE-START DISKWTR.
                14) RECOMMENDED ONCE A WEEK, RUN THE CLEANWTR
                    PROC TO DELETE OLD VSAM RECORDS AND OLD
                    DATASETS AND TO REORG THE JOURNAL FILE.
                15) FROM THIS POINT ON, ALWAYS START SAVEWTR
                    TO START DISKWTR. (NEVER START DISKWTR)
                    AT IPL TIME, START SAVEWTR.
                    (UPDATE YOUR "IPL" MEMBER IN AUTO TO START SAVEWTR


             NOTE:  RECOMMENDED TO PLACE SOUTCALL AND SOUTSEP INTO
                    YOUR IEALPA00 MEMBER OF SYS1.PARMLIB.
                    THIS WILL ELIMINATE MULTIPLE LOADINGS OF SOUTSEP
                    FOR EACH REPORT WRITTEN AND WILL ALSO ALLOW ANY
                    USER MOUNT AUTHORIZATION WHEN USING 4.S.


                    TEST THE ROUTINES ---- GOOD LUCK
