        THIS SYSTEM SHOULD PROVE USEFUL IF YOU WANT
        TO "SEQUENTIALIZE" A PDS.

 ----   THIS LIBRARY CONTAINS TWO PAIRS OF PROGRAMS:      ----

     1.  OFFLOADW AND PDSLOADW    (MODIFIED FROM CBT TAPE)
     2.  UNUPDTE  AND UPDTE       (FROM PL1 MODS TAPE - SPLA)

 ----   EACH PAIR IS A SELF-CONTAINED SYSTEM THAT IS      ----
 ----   INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER PAIR.                    ----

 ----   SEE MEMBER CALLED $$$$DOC2 FOR DESCRIPTION OF     ----
 ----   UPDTE AND UNUPDTE.                                ----

 ----   INSTALL MEMBERS ARE PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THE      ----
 ----   FOUR PROGRAMS.  THESE MEMBERS ARE SUFFIXED BY     ----
 ----   THE STRING "INS".                                 ----

        OFFLOADW AND PDSLOADW ALLOW IEBUPDTE-TYPE
        UNLOADING AND RELOADING OF PDS'ES TO SEQUENTIAL
        DATASETS.  THIS IS NOT RESTRICTED TO RECORD LENGTHS
        OF 80 FOR THE DATA.  ANY REASONABLY-SIZED
        FIXED-BLOCKED PDS'ES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS
        TREATMENT.  THIS OPENS IEBUPDTE-TYPE UNLOADS TO
        TAPE OR DISK-SEQUENTIAL DATASETS TO MUCH WIDER
        APPLICATION THAN HERETOFORE.

        THE RESULT WAS ACHIEVED BY SLIGHTLY MODIFYING
        EXISTING PROGRAMS PDSLOAD (FROM CBT TAPE FILE
        316) AND OFFLOAD (FROM CBT TAPE FILE 225).  A
        GLOBAL VARIABLE &LRECL WAS ADDED TO EACH
        PROGRAM.  WHEN THIS VARIABLE IS SET TO '80', THE
        PROGRAM ASSEMBLES AS BEFORE (EXCEPT FOR THE
        PRESENCE OF AN EYECATCHER).  HOWEVER, IF &LRECL
        IS SET TO A DIFFERENT VALUE (I TESTED 60 AND
        134), DATASETS OF THAT LOGICAL RECORD SIZE CAN
        GET THE IEBUPDTE-TYPE UNLOAD AND RELOAD
        TREATMENT, COMPLETE WITH THE   ./ ADD NAME=
        CONTROL CARDS.

        SAMPLE JCL TO EXECUTE BOTH PROGRAMS PDSLOADW
        AND OFFLOADW IS INCLUDED.

        MUCH THANKS TO ARNIE CASINGHINO OF CBT, WHO
        INSPIRED THIS EFFORT.  HE NEEDED TO MAKE GLOBAL
        CHANGES TO AN ACF2 DATABASE THAT WAS DUMPED TO
        PDS FORMAT.  THE CHANGES WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENTLY
        DONE TO A SEQUENTIAL DATASET THAN IF EACH MEMBER
        OF A 2000-MEMBER PDS HAD TO BE ACCESSED SEPARATELY.

        GOOD LUCK.  YOU CAN CONTACT:
