JES2 modification to hold SETUP messages
The JES2 /*SETUP control card is used to request that a volume is mounted
(usually a tape) before the job is released for execution (the /*SETUP
automatically holds the job).  However, the request to mount the volume is
issued as a rollable message and at most sites simply disappears from the
screen.
This modification causes the JES2 message to be issued as a Deletable Operator
Message (DOM), which remains displayed until the operator deletes it.  This is
useful for sites without a dedicated tape console.  Note that /*MESSAGE WTOs
will also become DOMs after this change is made to HASPRDR.
Be sure to check that the sequence numbers and code match your level of JES2 in
SYS1.HASPSRC before applying this usermod.
