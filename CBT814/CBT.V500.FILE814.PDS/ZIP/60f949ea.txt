Keeping  PF key definitions after IOGEN
INTRODUCTION
A very inconvenient effect of an IOGEN is that PF keys, previously defined on
one of the MVS consoles, are lost.  Therefore, after the IPL they have to be re-
supplied.
However, there are some easy ways to circumvent the problem.  It so happens
that, for every console defined in the IOGEN stage one input deck, a module is
created, containing the default PF key content as defined by IBM.  These modules
are read at IPL time, so that the values are available.
But how are these values saved across IPLs?  Whenever a PF key is changed, the
module is changed in place (the length of the module is fixed!).  These modules
are located in a dedicated library called SYS1.DCMLIB.  They are named IEEPKnnn,
where nnn is the console device number for MVS/XA users or the device address
for MVS/370 users.  So every IOGEN stage two replaces or adds the modules for
the consoles that were defined.  It does not however delete modules from earlier
IOGENs that are not applicable anymore.
Now let’s look at the ways to put your own values in these modules.  There are
three basic methods available.
METHOD ONE
Have the right values generated for stage two.  This solution requires a
modification to the macro that punches the stage two job stream.  This macro is
SGIEA2D2, which can be found in SYS1.AGENLIB.  The following job changes the
definitions in this macro.  It should be implemented as a USERMOD.
//jobname  JOB(account),'name',CLASS=X,NOTIFY=your-userid
//STEP     EXEC PGM=IEBUPDTE
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.AGENLIB
//SYSUT2   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.AGENLIB
//SYSIN    DD DATA
./CHANGE NAME=SGIEA2D2
&PFKDEF(1) SETC  'your definition for key 1'                        14465500
&PFKDEF(2) SETC  'your definition for key 2'                        14468600
&PFKDEF(3) SETC  'your definition for key 3'                        14471700
&PFKDEF(4) SETC  'your definition for key 4'                        14474800
&PFKDEF(5) SETC  'your definition for key 5'                        14477900
&PFKDEF(6) SETC  'your definition for key 6'                        14481000
&PFKDEF(7) SETC  'your definition for key 7'                        14484100
&PFKDEF(8) SETC  'your definition for key 8'                        14487200
&PFKDEF(9) SETC  'your definition for key 9'                        14490300
&PFKDEF(10)SETC  'your definition for key 10'                       14490310
&PFKDEF(11)SETC  'your definition for key 11'                       14490320
           etc
&PFKDEF(24)SETC  'your definition for key 24'                       14490450
&PRKDEF#   SETA 24                                                  14493400

METHOD TWO
Another way is to replace the modules by locally adapted modules.  This can be
accomplished by executing the following job stream for each console that was
defined (or only for the consoles actually used).  Remember to replace the
module and CSECT name before executing.  This method has the advantage of
supplying different values for the various consoles; the disadvantage is that
the jobs need to be executed after every IOGEN: the first method generated the
desired values automatically.
//jobname   JOB  (account),'name',CLASS=X,NOTIFY=your-userid
//ASM      EXEC ASMS,OBJ=OBJPDS03,MOD=IEEPKnnn
//SYSIN     DD   *
IEEPKnnn   CSECT
           DC  A(KEY)
           DC  XL10'0'
KEY        DC  AL2(ENDPFK-IEEPKnnn)
           DC  H'0'
           DC  FL1'1'
           DC  X'80'
           DC  CL108'your value for PFKey 1'
           DC  FL1'2'
           DC  X'80'
           DC  CL108'your value for PFKey 2
           DC  FL1'3'
           DC  X'80'
           DC  CL108'your value for PFKey 3'
        etc
           DC  FL1'24'
           DC  X'80'
           DC  CL108'your value for PFKey 24'
           DC  FL1'100'
           DC  0D
ENDPFK     EQU *
           END
/*
METHOD THREE
A third method guarantees an up-to-date PF key setting after the IOGENed system
is IPLed.  Just before the old system is stopped, the contents of SYS1.DCMLIB
are copied from the MVS resident to the MVS target value.  This method will
require re-names to be executed if the console configuration changes.
CONCLUSION
A general remark is that, before an IOGEN is executed, it is advisable to delete
all members in SYS1.DCMLIB and to compress the library.  Otherwise, obsolete
modules, for consoles not generated again, will occupy space in the library.
