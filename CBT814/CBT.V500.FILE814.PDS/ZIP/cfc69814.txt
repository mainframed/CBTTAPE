An MVS performance problem


PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

This article describes one of our MVS performance problems, the reason behind
it, and the solution to it.  We are running MVS/SP Release 1.3.5 on a 3081GX.
We found that, after a while, MVS performance deteriorated although the workload
was similar to what had run before.  A TSO user experienced erratic response,
which to our knowledge was caused by I/O contention.  We studied the RMF report
and found skewed I/O between physical channels on the logical channel where our
paging subsystem was connected.  Heavy channel utilisation, long DASD service
time,  poor page delay, and consequently an erratic terminal response resulted.
Furthermore, RMF showed a negative outstanding request on the lightly utilised
channel.


REASON

Unsolicited interrupts generated by an operator activating the attention switch
of a 3380 for suspended subchannels causes CATIOCNT to be decremented.  The
decrementing of the unsolicited interrupts eventually causes CATIOCNT to become
negative, which to the balance algorithm looks like a large positive value and
prevents the channel from being used further.

SOLUTION

Re-IPL MVS to reset CATIOCNT or apply APAR UZ03538, UZ03539, UZ70666, and
UZ68199.
