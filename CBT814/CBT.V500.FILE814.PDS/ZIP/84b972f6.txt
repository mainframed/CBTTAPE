SDSF and secondary JES2 support
ENVIRONMENT
The following facilities have been tested under JES2 1.3.4, SDSF 1.2.0 and
1.2.2, ISPF 1.1.0 and 2.2.0.  They should also work under JES2 1.3.6 and JES2
under XA as well as SDSF Version 2.
THE PROBLEM
When running a secondary JES2 system with a separate spool  file from the
primary JES2 there is no support in SDSF for access to the spool file belonging
to the secondary JES2 system.
THE SOLUTION
A simple modification to SDSF and to ISPF panels can be applied to extend SDSF
support to secondary JES2 systems with a separate spool file.
The first requirement is that secondary JES2 is active; call it, say, JESA.
Take a copy of ISFINIT and call it ISFINITA.
At sequence number 00240000 in ISFINITA add an entry point of ISFINITA; the
statement should look like:
     ENTRY SDSF,ISF,ISFISP,ISFISPA
In ISFINITA just before instruction
     ISFISP SAVE (14,12)
add the statement
     ISFISPA DS 0H
At sequence number 00410000 in ISFINITA change
     LOAD EP=ISFPARM
to
     LOAD EP=ISFPARMA
At seqence number 04240000 in ISFINITA change
     DELETE EP=ISFPARM
to
     DELETE EP=ISFPARMA
Assemble and link module ISFINITA under the name ISFINITA.
Create a parameter member ISFPARMA equal to ISFPARM and change a few parameters.
¥    First, the relevant macro for ISFPARM (for the primary JES2 system):
        ISFPMAC UNALLOC=YES,      USE UNALLOC TO SUPPORT SECOND JES  X
              NSPBUF=9,NIDBUF=9,SVCNUM=109,                          X
              DSNPRFX=SYS1,JESNAME=JES2,                             X
              SYSOUT=A,IDBLKS=4096,LINECNT=36,CKREAD=10,             X
              MENUS=ÕSYSX.SDSF.MENUSÕ,                               X
              INDEX=ÕSYSX.SDSF.HASPINDYÕ,                            X
              FINDLIM=10000,SCRSIZE=1920
¥    Secondly, the relevant macro for ISFPARMA (for the secondary JES2 system):
        ISFPMAC UNALLOC=YES,      USE UNALLOC TO SUPPORT SECOND JES  X
              NSPBUF=9,NIDBUF=9,SVCNUM=109,                          X
              DSNPRFX=SYSX,JESNAME=JESA,                             X
              SYSOUT=A,IDBLKS=4096,LINECNT=36,CKREAD=10,             X
              MENUS=ÕSYSX.SDSF.MENUSÕ,                               X
              INDEX=ÕSYSX.SDSF.HASPINDAÕ,                            X
              FINDLIM=10000,SCRSIZE=1920
The important parameters are:
¥    UNALLOC=YES  - this must be used.
¥    JESNAME=JES2 - the name of the primary JES2 system.
¥    JESNAME=JESA - the name of the secondary JES2 system (JESNAME=JESA, ie the
real JES name, must be used for the secondary JES2 system under SDSF 1.2.2,
while under SDSF 1.2.0 JESNAME=JES2 must be used for the secondary JES2 system
even if the name of it is JESA).
¥    INDEX=indexname - a separate index must be used for the primary and
secondary JES2 systems.
¥    DSNPRFX - since the primary and secondary JES2 systems must have different
prefixes for their spool files (prefix.HASPACE and prefix.HASPCKPT).
¥    The rest of the parameters are trivial.
Assemble and link module ISFPARMA under the name ISFPARMA.
When running ISPF Version 2 take a copy of the SDSF panel ZSDSFOP2 and call it
ZSDSFOPA.  Change the statement
     *,ÕPGM(ISFISP) PARM(&OPT)Õ)
to
     *,ÕPGM(ISFISPA) PARM(&OPT)Õ).
Add the following statements to your ISPF selection panel:
% 8 +SDSF       - SPOOL FACILITY JES2 %
% 8A+SDSF       - SPOOL FACILTIY JESA %
 .
)INIT
 .
  &ZQ = ' '
 .
)PROC
 .
    &ZQ = TRUNC(&ZCMD,'.')
 .
                8,'PANEL(ZSDSFOPT) NEWAPPL(ISF)'
             '8A','PANEL(ZSDSFOPT) NEWAPPL(ISF)'
 .
   &ZTRAIL = .TRAIL
   /* THE TECHNIQUE WITH ZCMD DOES NOT WORK FOR V2 USING NESTED CALL */
   IF (ZCMD = '8')
       IF (&ZENVIR = ' ')         /* BLANK FOR V1 */
           &SEL = 'PGM(ISFINIT)'
   /* THE TECHNIQUE WITH ZQ DOES NOT WORK FOR V1 USING NESTED CALL */
   IF (&ZQ = '8')
       IF (&ZENVIR ^= ' ')        /* NONBLANK FOR V2 AND HIGHER */
           &SEL = 'PGM(ISFISP) NOCHECK NEWAPPL(ISF)'
           IF (&ZTRAIL ^= ' ')
               &ZSEL = 'PANEL(ZSDSFOP2) NEWAPPL(ISF)'
   /* THE FOLLOWING IS FOR SUPPORTING ALTERNATE JES */
   IF (&ZCMD = '8A')
       IF (&ZENVIR = ' ')         /* BLANK FOR V1 */
           &SEL = 'PGM(ISFINITA)'
   IF (&ZQ = '8A')
       IF (&ZENVIR ^= ' ')        /* NONBLANK FOR V2 AND HIGHER */
           &SEL = 'PGM(ISFISPA) NOCHECK NEWAPPL(ISF)'
           IF (&ZTRAIL ^= ' ')
               &ZSEL = 'PANEL(ZSDSFOPA) NEWAPPL(ISF)'
)END
The above ISPF statements will support both ISPF Versions 1 and 2.  Selection 8
calls SDSF for the primary JES2 system and selection 8A calls SDSF for the
secondary JES2 system.
It is not possible to go into primary and secondary JES2 systems at the same
time under split screen since SDSF has got only one set of DDNAMEs.  If you try
this SDSF does not unallocate the spool and checkpoint datasets.
Have a CLIST that can do the job just in case:
PROC 0
CONTROL NOMSG NOFLUSH NOLIST NOCONLIST NOSYMLIST
ERROR DO
 SET &RET = &LASTCC
 RETURN
END
FREE FI(HASPINDX)             /* free sdsf index    */
FREE FI(HASPCKPT)             /* free jes chkpoint  */
FREE FI(HASPAC00)             /* free spool vol 1   */
FREE FI(HASPAC01)             /* free spool vol 2   */
FREE FI(HASPAC02)             /* free spool vol 3   */
FREE FI(HASPAC03)             /* free spool vol 4   */
END
The technique can be extended in the same way to support any number of secondary
JES2 systems having separate spool files.
