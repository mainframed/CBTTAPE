Reader's letter

There appears to be a small problem with the PDS re-initialise
program documented in MVS Update, Issue 27.  It worked
wonderfully under our old MVS/XA 2.1 system but when we ran
it on our MVS/XA 2.2 system we received an S0C9 abend.  After
some heartache and help from IBM, it appears that the two:

    ICM   R2,8,DEVTYPE+4

instructions should actually read:

    ICM   R2,8,DEVTYPE+3

Another bug I found is that the:

    ORG   *-10

just after the XDAP macro calls should be:

    ORG   *-14
