Incorporating IKJTSOxx changes

The PARMLIB command (introduced with the ESA version of
TSO/E 2.1) provides the capability of incorporating
SYS1.PARMLIB(IKJTSOxx) changes on the fly.  This does
not help installations who are still using TSO/E 1.4 (where the
IKJTSOxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB was first introduced)
or the pre-ESA release of TSO/E 2.1.

The PARMLIB command provides a very useful function for
those people who have the command at their disposal.  For
those who don't, the TSOPARM command processor described
in this article provides a similar function for pre-ESA TSO/E
releases that support the IKJTSOxx member of
SYS1.PARMLIB.

The syntax of the TSOPARM command is as follows:

o      TSOPARM LIST(ALL) - LIST(ALL) is the default.

o      TSOPARM LIST(statement type) - where statement type
      is either AUTHCMD, AUTHPGM, NOTBKGND,
      AUTHTSF, or SEND.  For example, LIST(AUTHCMD)
      will display the current list of authorized command names.

o      TSOPARM UPDATE(suffix) - where suffix is the two-
      character suffix of the IKJTSO member to update from.
      For example, UPDATE(01) will introduce the parameters
      from SYS1.PARMLIB(IKJTSO01).

The LIST(ALL) parameter provides a list of all the current
specifications for each statement type.  Figure 1 shows some
sample output from a TSOPARM LIST(ALL) command.  The
LIST(statement type) parameter provides a list of the current
specifications for the statement type requested.  The
UPDATE(suffix) parameter indicates that the current
specifications are to be updated to reflect the contents of the
newly specified IKJTSOxx member.

For UPDATE requests, TSOPARM will activate the new
IKJTSOxx specifications for the invoking user immediately.
Other active logged-on users will have to log on again to make
the changes effective for their address space as many of the
control block pointers that are altered by the TSOPARM
command are stored in the Log-on Work Area (LWA) at log-on
time and are maintained in private area storage.

TSOPARM should be linked into an authorized library with
link-edit attribute AC(1).  TSOPARM should also be included
in the AUTHCMD statement of SYS1.PARMLIB(IKJTSO00)
and, for the last time for this type of change, an IPL done to
incorporate this AUTHCMD update.
