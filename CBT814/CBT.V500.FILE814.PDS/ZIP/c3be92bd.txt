Automatic mounting of direct access volumes
The method for ensuring desired mount attributes of DASD volumes at IPL time
(described in MVS Update, issue 21, June 1988, in the article Automatic mounting
of direct access volumes) is quite complex.  Most users simply want to change
the IBM default for volumes not in the VATLST from PUBLIC to some other
attribute to prevent undesirable dataset allocations.
The following USERMOD is much simpler than the method described in the article
and satisfies the requirement to change this PUBLIC default attribute to
PRIVATE/RESERVED for all volumes not in the VATLST.  I first developed this ZAP
in 1973 to fix the same problem for OS and passed it around to my colleagues on
the SHARE OS/MVT-MFT project.  The ZAP as shown is current for MVS/XA at level
2.1.2.  With MVS/ESA the ZAP will be unnecessary; IBM will allow the user to
specify default attributes in MVS/ESA.
Once the ZAP is applied, your SYS1.PARMLIB VATLST member need only include those
volumes that must be PUBLIC, STORAGE, and/or just ‘up’ (the Y parameter) at IPL
time.
