Execution of CLISTs in batch
It may be desirable to exploit the full range of CLIST facilities in batch
combining the use of TSO commands, programming logic, and CLIST built-in
functions.  The IBM TSO/E manual states that a terminal session can be executed
in batch, ie  any command that can be entered on a TSO terminal can be put into
a CLIST that can be submitted to background;  this statement excludes the use of
CLIST programming statements such as assignment statements and logic statements
together with the built-in functions.
Fortunately, calling a CLIST from a TSO terminal by entering the name of the
CLIST preceded by a % sign is a valid TSO command, and therefore also valid in
batch, provided the CLIST exists as a member in a PDS under the DDNAME SYSPROC.
A CLIST called in this indirect way under batch will function correctly even for
the full range of CLIST facilities.  For example:
//STEP1   EXEC   PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=128,PARM='%XYZ'
//SYSTSPRT  DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN   DD   DUMMY
//SYSPROC   DD   DSN=A.B.CLIST,DISP=SHR
or
//STEP1   EXEC   PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=128
//SYSTSPRT  DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSPROC   DD   DSN=A.B.CLIST,DISP=SHR
//SYSTSIN   DD   *
%XYZ
where IKJEFT01 is the name of TSO.  Use DYNAMNBR to allow dynamic allocations.
XYZ is the name of the CLIST in PDS A.B.CLIST and the DD statements SYSTSPRT and
SYSTSIN are required for the execution of TSO in batch.
The CLIST can either be called via the PARM field on the EXEC statement or it
can be placed as a command in SYSTSIN.  If an in-line/in-job CLIST is desirable,
instead of putting the CLIST in a different library, the following technique can
be used:
//STEP1      EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSIN      DD   DUMMY
//SYSPRINT   DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT2     DD   DSN=&TEMP(GO),DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=VIO,
//  SPACE=(CYL,(1,1,1))
//SYSUT1     DD   *
This is the CLIST:
//STEP2      EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=128,PARM='%GO'
//SYSTSPRT   DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN    DD   DUMMY
//SYSPROC    DD   DSN=&TEMP,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
The facility of using CLISTs in batch is a very powerful tool in managing an MVS
system and developing utility functions.
