Relieving spool congestion
There are a number of ways of relieving spool congestion.  If there are a lot of
TSO sessions, commands such as £PT1-9999, entered regularly and automatically,
will delete session output.  This will not affect active sessions but if users
allocate SYSOUT datasets to their sessions these will be deleted also.  The
spool off-load and restore facility can be used to dump and subsequently reload
jobs from the spool.  The MVS external writer can be used to select the output
of a given class and write it to disk or tape.  This can be returned to the
spool by simply copying the file created in this way to SYSOUT.
One of the main problems with tuning JES is that it produces no statistics on
its own performance.  The type 26 SMF record, which is written when all the
datasets from a job are purged from the spool, contains some information on
spool usage such as the number of spool bytes allocated to a job, lines of
output it contained etc.  Collection of the type 26 records is achieved by
specifying TYPE26=YES (the default) on the JOBCLASS(c), TSUCLASS, and STCCLASS
definition statements and amending the SUBSYS(STC(...)) definition in the
SMFPRMxx member of PARMLIB.  The STC definition must be amended because, even
though the SMF records concern batch jobs or TSO sessions, the records are
stored on the spool and written by JES when the last print dataset is purged.
The following SAS code illustrates some simple processing of type 26 records.
It produces a table of spool usage in Kbytes by duration for jobs, TSO sessions,
and started tasks.

TITLE 'SPOOL USE BY DURATION';
The article in the December 1987 issue of MVS Update on JES2 spool allocation
described the use of the TGSIZE parameter but did not go into the other
parameters which affect spool allocation and utilisation, and the performance
and resource utilisation implications of making changes to these parameters.
The version of JES to which this article applies is 1.3.6 (which is functionally
equivalent to JES 2.1.5).
In general, the spool can be allocated over multiple volumes but each spool file
must be in a single extent.  A common configuration is to have the spool on a
single 3380-type disk with a single-track VTOC on track 1 of cylinder 0 (after
the volume label) with the remaining space (13273 tracks in the case of a single
density disk) allocated to the spool.
The parameters affecting spool allocation and utilisation are:
¥    BUFSIZE - This is the size of a spool buffer in bytes.  The spool is
formatted into buffers of this size.  I/O operations are also performed on
buffers.  The default size is 3992, which ensures that a buffer and its
associated IOB will fit in a 4K page.  Using this default value will allow 10
buffers per 3380 track, which makes 84% use of the disk space.  However, it
makes good use of scarcer real storage.  It is the recommended value and it can
only be modified at cold start.
¥    TGSIZE - This is the number of buffers in a track group.  Each batch job,
TSO session, or started task is allocated spool space in track groups.  The
default TGSIZE value is 30 buffers, which, with the default BUFSIZE, is three
3380 tracks.  It can be modified at warm start.
¥    TRKCELL - This is the number of buffers in a track cell.  Track celling is
both a spool organisational parameter and a performance option for locally
attached printers.  It is meant specifically for high-speed printers such as
3800s.  As a spool parameter it applies to print classes which have TRKCELL=YES
(the default) specified on their OUTCLASS(c) definition statement.  When
DSPLTCEL is specified on the PRTnnn definition statement (the default is
DSPLSNGL), print datasets for classes that are defined with TRKCELL=YES are de-
spooled to the printer in track cells rather than in single buffers.  It can
operate for all locally-attached printers even though they may not be able to
take advantage of it.  Data is still de-spooled in cells and I/O to the spool is
consequently reduced.  However, JES fixes printer buffers in storage.  On the
spool, tracks are divided into cells.  The size of a cell cannot exceed the
number of buffers on a track - if it does, the cell consists of the whole track.
After the subdivision of a track, any buffers that are left over are considered
as a new cell if their number is greater than or equal to half the TRKCELL
value.  If the number left over is less than this, those buffers are not
considered as a cell and are only available for print datasets in the job which
occupies the track group within which are the cell and the print classes that do
not have TRKCELL=YES defined.  The default TRKCELL value is 3, which means that
with the default BUFSIZE a track consists of three cells and one buffer left
over.  The left-over buffer will not be used for print datasets with TRKCELL=YES
since it is less than half the cell size.  So, if the default values are used
for BUFSIZE, TRKCELL, and OUTCLASS(c) TRKCELL, 10% of the spool will be unable
to be used.  TRKCELL can only be changed at cold start.
These spool allocation parameters must be considered with reference to the type
of work in an installation.  If there are a lot of jobs that produce a small
amount of output (such as TSO sessions that do not produce print datasets or
allocate many files) the spool utilisation will be artificially high with a lot
of spool space being allocated but unused.  The default TGSIZE of 30 buffers of
3992 bytes may be too high.  When my installation was replacing disks recently,
I conducted a number of tests on JES spool performance and utilisation for a
variety of TGSIZE and TRKCELL values.  For each combination, a series of 400
jobs that produced 3.12 million lines of output was run.  The job stream
consisted of single and multiple step jobs that produced single and multiple
print files of varying sizes.  The length of the print records was both fixed
(in a variety of lengths) and variable.  Most of the print lines were quite full
- at least 80 bytes in length - so the percentage spool utilisation achieved for
the 3.12 million lines of output will not be an accurate reflection of the
actual spool capacity but the relative percentage spool utilisation will still
be valid.  For the test, the spool was on a 3380D-type disk and was allocated
the full disk, as described above.  The checkpoint dataset was also on a 3380D
disk.  During the test no printers or other devices were active.  Only one other
task, a monitor, was active.  Since during the test a large number of batch jobs
were writing large amounts of output to the spool, spool device busy and service
time figures were very high.  Again, the relative values are important.
Figure 1 outlines the results of the tests.  The measures given are:
% SPOOL UTILISATION - Percentage spool utilisation returned by the £DSPOOL
command.
SPOOL SIOs - The number of SIOs issued to the spool disk.
SPOOL % DEVICE BUSY - Percentage of the time during the test the spool disk was
busy.
SPOOL TOTAL SERVICE TIME - Average time to service an I/O request plus average
time spent in queue.
SPOOL QUEUE SERVICE TIME - Average amount of time I/O requests spent queued for
spool disk.
SPOOL SERVICE TIME - Average I/O request service time.
AVG QUEUE DEPTH - Average number of I/O requests spent queued for spool disk.
CHKPT SIOs - The number of SIOs issued to the disk containing the checkpoint
dataset.
CHKPT % DEVICE BUSY - Percentage time during the test the checkpoint dataset
disk was busy.
CHKPT TOTAL SERVICE TIME - Average time to service an I/O request plus average
time spent in queue.
JES AVG PVT AREA FRAMES - Average number of allocated page frames for the JES
address space.
JES MAX PVT AREA FRAMES - Maximum number of allocated page frames for the JES
address space.
JES TCB SERVICE/1000 - JES performance group TCB service units/1000.
JES SRB SERVICE/1000 - JES performance group SRB service units/1000.
JES I/O SERVICE/1000 - JES performance group I/O service units/1000.
JES MEM SERVICE/1000 - JES performance group storage service units/1000.
JES TOTAL SERVICE/1000 - JES performance group total service units.
