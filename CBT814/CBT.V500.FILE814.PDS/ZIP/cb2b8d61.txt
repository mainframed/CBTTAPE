Changing the size of ISPF edit recovery files
THE PROBLEM
Under Version 2 Release 2 of ISPF there is no documented way of changing the
default size of the edit recovery dataset when editing with recovery on.  By
default the primary allocation is 52 blocks and the secondary allocation is 200
blocks.  The dataset is defined with  a blocksize of 3120 and RECFM U.  The
allocation is then rounded up to the nearest number of tracks.  This should be
enough for even very large modules, but when editing large modules an SB37 abend
may appear for the recovery dataset, in which case recovery should be turned
off.
THE SOLUTION
There is a way to change the allocation amount by ZAPping CSECT ISREBD in module
ISRSUBS where the amounts are in two full words.
At UZ50367 the ZAP is:
NAME ISRSUBS ISREBD
VER 0364 00000040,00000200
REP 0364 0000xxxx,0000yyyy
Replace xxxx and yyyy with your new defaults.
