Stacking ISPF displays

Have you ever been using ISPF in split screen mode and wished
you could split the screen again without exiting the two displays
you have?  The following CLIST allows you to do the next best
thing and save your display on a stack while you perform some
other ISPF function, then restore your display when you’ve
finished.  It will push down the current ISPF display and invoke
the ISPF/PDF Primary Option Menu.  When you exit, it will pop
up the previous display.  You may stack multiple displays, but
you must restore them in last-in-first-out order.  Invoke the CLIST
by entering TSO %clist from any ISPF panel or save the command
on a PF key for ease of use.  Return by entering
RETURN;RETURN or save the command on a PF key.

/* EXIT THE CURRENT ISPF DISPLAY AND POP UP THE PREVIOUS ONE */
