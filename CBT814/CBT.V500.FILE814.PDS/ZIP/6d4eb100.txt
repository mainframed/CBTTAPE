Listing allocated datasets
Readers of Paul Horak’s useful article, Listing attributes of allocated
datasets, in the July 1988 issue of MVS Update may be interested in the
additions needed to ensure reliable operation of the LISTDD program in an MVS/XA
2.2 or MVS/ESA environment.
In line 58 of the program (two lines after the label LOOP1) there is an
instruction to load the address of the JFCB from field TIOEJFCB in the TIOT.
This instruction will function correctly as long as the JFCB remains below the
16-megabyte line (ie MVS/XA releases 2.1.0 through to 2.1.7, and all releases of
MVS/370).  However, in MVS/XA 2.2 and subsequent releases (including MVS/ESA),
it becomes an installation option to move the JFCB above the 16-megabyte line.
The location of the JFCB, along with 12 other scheduler control blocks, is
determined by an option on the JOBCLASS, TSUCLASS, and STCCLASS statements in
JES2PARM, or on the CIPARM statement in the JES3 initialisation deck.  These
options can be overridden for individual jobs by the IEFUJV SMF exit.  For those
installations that have chosen to place the scheduler control blocks above the
16-megabyte line, a somewhat more circuitous method of determining the JFCB
address is required.
Those who are familiar with the TIOT from system dumps may have noticed that the
JFCB pointers in the TIOT are 24-bit address fields aligned in the high-order
three bytes of a fullword rather than the more usual low-order three bytes.  The
reason for this is that OS/360 environments (including MVT, the predecessor of
MVS) stored their JFCBs on disk storage.  Thus the TIOEJFCB field was originally
a disk address (the TTR of the JFCB in the SYS1.SYSJOBQE dataset).  In fact the
debugging handbook still refers to this field, incorrectly, as a TTR.
When the JFCB moved into virtual storage with the first release of MVS, TIOEJFCB
became a 24-bit virtual storage address, but retained its unusual alignment
within the TIOT.  This remains true for all releases of MVS up to and including
MVS/XA 2.1.7.  Once the JFCB has moved above the line, however, it has a 31-bit
address, for which there is no room in the TIOT.  This poses a problem, because
the format of the TIOT is too well-established to be changed.  The solution
chosen by the designers of MVS was to replace the JFCB address by a 24-bit
identifier called a token, which uniquely identifies a particular JFCB.  If the
JFCB is below the 16-megabyte line, the token is a 24-bit virtual address of the
JFCB.  But if the JFCB is above the line, a call must be made to a new MVS
component, the SWA Manager, to translate the 24-bit token into a 31-bit virtual
storage address.
The JFCB is used to invoke the SWA Manager.  The program calling the SWAREQ
macro must provide a parameter list called the SWA External Parameter Area
(EPA), whose format is defined by the IEFZB505 mapping macro.  The program must
also include mapping macros for the CVT and the JESCT, because the SWAREQ macro
references these control blocks to obtain the address of the SWA Manager
routine.  The SWAREQ macro is documented in GC28-1151 MVS/XA System Macros and
Facilities Volume 1.  Documentation APAR OY04926 provides clarification of the
SWAREQ calling sequence.
Because the LISTDD program runs unauthorised, it must use the UNAUTH=YES form of
the SWAREQ macro.  Unauthorised SWA Manager support has only recently become
available through APAR OY10290.  To use the UNAUTH=YES keyword, PTF UY16002 (on
PUT 8802) must be installed on the MVS/XA 2.2 system.
Although the SWAREQ macro exists in MVS/XA 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.1.7, there is
currently no PTF to provide unauthorised SWA Manager support for these releases.
Consequently the modifications to the LISTDD program will not be portable to
pre-MVS/XA 2.2 environments.
The changes required to the LISTDD program are shown below.
After the ICM R1,7,TIOEJFCB statement, the following lines need to be added:
         LA    R10,REQEPA      POINT TO SWA PARAMETER AREA
         USING ZB505,R10       ADDRESSABILITY TO EPA
         STCM  R1,7,SWVA       STORE JFCB TOKEN INTO EPA
         SR    R1,R1           CLEAR R1
         ST    R1,SWQMPA       ZEROISE QMPA ADDRESS
         SWAREQ MF=(E,REQLIST),UNAUTH=YES  CALL SWA MANAGER
         L     R1,SWPFXPTR     LOAD 31-BIT JFCB ADDRESS
The following data areas need to be added after the LTORG statement:
REQLIST  SWAREQ FCODE=LA,EPA=REQPTR,MF=L    SWAREQ PLIST
REQPTR   DC    A(REQEPA)       POINTER TO SWA EPA
REQEPA   DC    XL36'00'        SWA EXTERNAL PARAMETER AREA
and the following mapping macros need to be added at the end of the program
(before the END statement):
         IEFZB505 LOCEPAX=YES  EPA MAPPING DSECT
         CVT   DSECT=YES       CVT MAPPING DSECT
         IEFJESCT ,            JESCT MAPPING DSECT
Also, the following statements need to be added after the LISTDD CSECT
statement:
LISTDD   AMODE 31
LISTDD   RMOVE 24
