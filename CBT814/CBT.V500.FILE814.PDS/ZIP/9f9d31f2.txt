A better condition code checker

The MVS Update articles on condition code checking
(Condition code checking in JCL, March 1990 and More about
condition code checking, July 1990) and on SDSF in batch
(Batch mode SDSF, November 1988) finally inspired me to
develop a utility I've wanted for ages. All our production JCL
is tested for condition codes as per the July 1990 article, ie:

      //CHECK EXEC PGM=IEFBR14,COND=(4,LT)

followed by:

      //CALLOUT EXEC JOBFAIL,COND=((0,LT,CHECK),(EVEN))

This is OK, except that you're working at the lowest level.
You get notified of a job failure whichever step fails even
though a failure in one step is not as critical as a failure in
another.

A prime example is a dataset reorganization job. If for some
reason the unload fails, there isn't an immediate problem as
long as the dataset is still available to other users. However, if
the delete or reload steps fail, the dataset will be unavailable to
others and an immediate fix is required. It is frustrating for
both parties if the operations department has to ring up in the
middle of the night only to be told that the situation can wait
until the morning to be resolved. A way is required of failing
the job with a message indicating the correct level of severity.

If you really understood condition code checking you probably
could work out a way of doing it. However, all our JCL is
automatically generated so an easier solution is required. From
a systems programmer's mindset a routine could be developed
along the lines of the Assembler condition code checking
program in the March 1990 issue, but I haven't the knowledge
to do it. Therefore, I used what knowledge I do have and
combined SDSF in batch with a CLIST.

SDSF is used to print the output in $SYSMSGS to a dataset.
The CLIST extracts the results of each step, then a job-specific
part of the CLIST sets a condition code based on the
combination of the previous codes. Because of the way arrays
are handled in CLISTs it was easy to handle related steps even
if they are not run one after the other. All that is needed is
some sort of naming standard for the step names.

Just after I finished the CLIST we upgraded TSO so that we
now have REXX. I have translated the CLIST to REXX as a
way of learning a bit about REXX. It was relatively
straightforward once I worked out where to put commas, and
remembered how PL/I SUBSTRs worked. The only thing I
couldn't find out how to do easily was to convert '01' to '1' so
that I could use it as a subscript that I could easily regenerate
later in a DO loop. I finally bypassed the problem by using the
MIN function.

I have included both the CLIST and REXX code. I have also
included the job I used to test it and the output from that job.
