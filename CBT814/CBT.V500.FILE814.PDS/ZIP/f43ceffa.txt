Correction to the July issue

We regret that an incomplete version of the code in the article
SMF job/step termination exit was inadvertently published in
our July issue. The following changes need to be made to the
source code for the exit.

The section between the labels UBEND and CPUTIME should
read:

UBEND    EQU   *
         MVC   MSGLINE+58(1),=C'U'    * USER ABEND INDICATOR
         B     CONVERT
NOTABEND EQU   *
         MVC   MSGLINE+58(1),=C'0'    * NORMAL COMPLETION
CONVERT  EQU   *
         LA    R7,0                   * CLEAR OUT R7
         LH    R7,SMF30SCC            * LOAD UP COND CODE
         N     R7,=X'00000FFF'        * GET RID OF INDICATOR
         CVD   R7,PWORK               * CONVERT TO DECIMAL
         UNPK  UWORK,PWORK            * UNPACK IT
         OI    UWORK+3,X'F0'          * CLEAR LAST BYTE
         MVC   MSGLINE+59(4),UWORK+0  * MOVE IN COND CODE
CPUTIME  EQU   *

The eleventh line after the label CPUTIME should read:

         MVC   MSGLINE+103(2),UWORK+2 * MOVE TO MSG LINE

Between the last statement (BR R8) in the section labelled
WRITEMSG and the * CONSTANTS comment, insert:

In the section beginning with the * CONSTANTS comment the
