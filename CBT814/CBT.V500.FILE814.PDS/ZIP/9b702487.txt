Annual award winners

All the votes are now in for the 1990 MVS Update article of
the year awards.

The article that saved readers' installations most money was
judged to be A TSO/ISPF editor split-screen data copier by
Paul Jespersen (May 1990).  On average, this article saved all
subscribers who sent in a voting paper approximately $145
each - that's equivalent to a total saving of over $300,000 for
our total circulation.

The article that saved readers most time was judged to be
Creating an MVS mini system by Thierry Falissard (June
1990).  The average time saved by all subscribers who sent in a
voting paper was 5.52 hours each - equivalent to a total saving
of around 50,000 hours for our combined readership.

MVS Update saves the average subscriber's installation
$2075.81 and 75.16 hours a year.  February's issue saved
readers most money (an average saving of $306.45).  The
March issue saved them most time (an average saving of 9.84
hours).

The purpose of these awards, which were introduced last year,
is twofold - to give public recognition to these authors and to
enable us to tailor MVS Update more accurately to the needs of
our subscribers by concentrating more on the types of article
you have indicated are of most benefit to your installations.

If you feel that you could contribute an article but are unsure of
how to go about it, please contact the editor, Steve Piggott,
through any of the addresses shown on page 2, for a free copy
of our Notes for contributors.

We extend our congratulations to Paul Jespersen and Thierry
Falissard - your prizes are on their way to you now.  Our
thanks go to all the readers who took the trouble to vote.
