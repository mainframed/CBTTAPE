Effects of block size and buffer space
In most computer installations physical I/O determines the task elapsed time, ie
response time in on-line systems and run-time in batch systems.
One physical I/O consists of several steps: software overhead to start the I/O
and handle the I/O interrupt, channel or I/O-processor handling time, queue time
for the channel/path, seek time on the disk, search time on the disk, queue time
for the channel/path for reconnect, and data transfer time.
Assuming a path and device utilisation of 0.2, a device type 3380, and a block
size of 4K, the following figures can be used:
¥    3 msec software time
¥    3 msec channel/path handling overhead
¥    3 msec channel/path queue time
¥    16 msec seek time
¥    8 msec search time
¥    3 msec reconnect queue time
¥    2 msec data transfer time.
This gives a total time of accessing a 4K block of 38 msec.  Accessing a block
of half-track size costs 44 msec (8 msec for data transfer).  This means that
accessing six times more data costs 15% in additional clock time.  If the access
is random this could, of course, be too much data; but if access is sequential
(or the data is in a PDS) the effects, besides more data in less time, are:
¥    Less CPU overhead
¥    Less overhead on the channel/path
¥    Less contention of the disk actuator.
These considerations also apply to tape I/O with appropriate modifications: here
a block size equal to the maximum supported by the software (32K) will be
optimal.
One effect of using a large block size on disk, provided the block size is
selected under consideration of the physical track length, is that the storage
media will be able to contain the maximum amount of data, avoiding waste on
unnecessary inter-record gaps.
On 3380s the track size is 47.5K and the inter-record gap around 0.7K: having a
block size as close as possible to 23476, but not above, will give the best
utilisation.
For disks with a track size of less than 32K the optimal block size, from a
utilisation point of view, is equal to the track size.
Another way of speeding up data access is I/O-chaining and CPU-I/O overlap via
multiple buffers.
The main types of buffer handling that can be identified are:
1    QSAM - by default, five buffers equal in size to the block size are used.
More than five buffers can be allocated using the DCB parameter, BUFNO.  One I/O
can, at maximum, transfer 240K of data or 30 buffers, whichever is the least.
Buffer space greater than the above limitation can be useful to facilitate CPU-
I/O overlap.
     JCL example: DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=200,BLKSIZE= 23400,BUFNO=24)
2    PDS - since PDS-organised datasets are now exclusively used for libraries,
data in such files is accessed sequentially.  Similar rules for block sizes
apply here although it is usually not possible to accommodate a buffer number.
It should be noted that the indicated block size is a maximum block size; if a
member contains less data than the block size can contain, the member is built
as a short block, which means that accessing a small member (like an ISPF panel)
from a library with a large block size means only transferring a block with the
actual size and not with the defined dataset block size.
3    VSAM (non-DL/I) - the default is two data buffers equal to the data Control
Interval size and, in the case of KSDS files, one index buffer equal to the
index Control Interval size.  In random mode elapsed time can be reduced by
having more index blocks in memory at the same time;  and in sequential mode
more data buffers means that more data can be transferred in one I/O.  The JCL
AMP parameter, BUFND, defines the number of data buffers and BUFNI defines the
number of index buffers (BUFSP can be used instead of BUFND and BUFNI).  The
MVS/XA VSAM AdministratorÕs Guide GC26-4151-2 pages 87-93 gives an excellent
description of VSAM buffering.
     Example of JCL parameter: AMP=(ÔAMORG,BUFND=32, BUFNI=64Õ)
4    VSAM DL/I - the number of buffers is allocated as specified in the dataset
defined under the DDNAME DFSVSAMP.  Buffers can be specified as 0.5K, 1K, 2K,
4K, 8K, 12K, 16K, 20K, 24K, 28K and 32K, and to each buffer size a number of
buffers is assigned.  From the allocated buffers the accessed files will use
buffers corresponding to their  Control Interval size or, in the case of no
match, the next highest will be used.  It should be noted that a specified
buffer size multiplied by the number of buffers will be allocated even if no
file can actually use this buffer size, thus unnecessarily increasing the size
of the region.  It is therefore probably best to have a large amount of buffers
in the range 0.5K to 8K, thus catching most databases since control interval
sizes tend to be in the lower end and have one large pool of 32K buffers taking
all the rest of the Control Interval sizes.  Having a large amount of buffers
will speed up access, supporting more data in memory at the same time, or
allowing larger amounts of data to be transferred in one I/O.  Refer to the
manual IMS/VS Installation Guide SH20-9081-8 pages 249-251.

Using a 23K block size and 32 buffers gives the shortest elapsed time; elapsed
time is reduced by a factor of 4.4 and CPU time by 2 from the worst to the best
case.

For the small control interval size of 4K, 32 buffers seem to give the shortest
elapsed time, whereas for a Control Interval size of 23K it does not seem to
matter if 16 or 32 buffers are used.  Elapsed time is reduced by a factor of 4.8
and CPU time by 1.8 from the worst to the best case.

Further experiments using larger amounts of buffers and/or buffers of sizes 12K,
16K, 20K, 24K, and 28K did not reduce elapsed time or CPU time further but did
increase the region size and real storage allocated.  Elapsed time is reduced by
a factor of 5 and CPU time by 1.9 from the worst to the best case.

SERVICE UNITS
Service units (SUs) are a measure of resource utilisation composed of CPU
consumption, physical I/Os, and real storage times CPU time consumption (each
component multiplied by its own individual weight factor selected by the
installation).  Therefore the SU does not express an exact price, but gives only
an idea of the resource utilisation relationships.
REGION SIZE
It is obvious that a bigger block size or a larger amount of buffers will
require a larger region size than is otherwise necessary.  We found that with
the above-mentioned test runs we had to increase the region size in general from
2Mb to 6Mb.  When using a 6Mb region we did not experience any out-of-region
abends at all.
STORAGE UTILISATION
Since I/O buffers are page-fixed during the physical I/O, it is expected that
real storage requirements will grow using a big block size and/or many buffers.
But the real storage used is best expressed as a product of the total I/O time
and the storage used, which means that the reduction of the number of I/Os will,
to some extent, compensate for the larger buffer space.  All in all, some small
additional real storage utilisation could be experienced.
CONCLUSION
Using the largest possible block size that the hardware can accommodate and a
buffer number specification much bigger than the default number that the access
method will allocate, ie in the range 16 to 64, has tremendous effects on
elapsed times and CPU consumption: elapsed times can be reduced by up to a
factor of 5 and CPU time by a factor of up to 2.
