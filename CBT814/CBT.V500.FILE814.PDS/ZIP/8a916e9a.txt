Dynamic allocation dataset diversion - a fix
Between ISPF Release 1 and ISPF Release 2, IBM changed the format of the
UNITNAME text unit that is created by the ISPF ÔDATA SET UTILITYÕ (menu 3.2)
function.  This renders the IEFDB401 exit described in the article Dynamic
allocation diversion (issue 18, March 1988) ineffective in controlling this type
of allocation.  To fix the problem, replace the code from the CTULNG label to
the CHKCYL label with the following code:
CTULNG   DS    0H
         LH    R1,S99TULNG        LOAD TEXT LENGTH
         BCTR  R1,0               DECREMENT FOR EXECUTE
         EX    R1,CLC1            'SYSTSO'?
         BE    DISPATCH           YES
         EX    R1,CLC2            'SYSTSO#'?
         BNE   RETURN             NO
         MVI   S99TUPAR+6,C' '    BLANK '#'
         B     RETURN             GO TO RETURN
CLC1     CLC   S99TUPAR(0),=CL8'SYSTSO'
CLC2     CLC   S99TUPAR(0),=CL8'SYSTSO#'
CHKCYL   DS    0H
