Members in file concatenations - a correction
It has been brought to our attention that the article Identifying members in
file concatenations (January 1988) uses a non-IBM macro, DMJOBNAM.  The
statement referencing this macro can be replaced by the following code:
         EXTRACT ATIOT,FIELDS=(TIOT)
         L     R9,ATIOT               R9: ADDRESS OF TIOT
         .
         .
ATIOT    DS    A                      RESULT AREA FOR EXTRACT MACRO
We apologise for any inconvenience that this oversight may have caused.
