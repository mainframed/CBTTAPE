Breaking and fixing the TSOLOCK

I have made some modifications to the program TSOLOCK,
which is described in the article Unattended ACF2 TSO Session
Security, (Issue 22, MVS Update), changing the environment
from ACF2 to TOP SECRET using the RACINIT macro.  Some
problems have been discovered and fixed, and I believe these
problems are universal to other security packages.  In my
program, TSOLOCK has been re-named IKJRINIT

PROBLEM ONE

When TOP SECRET displays the prompt 'TSS750A PLEASE
ENTER YOUR TOP SECRET PASSWORD', you can hit the
ATTN key several times until '|I' shows, get 'READY' on the
screen, key in ISPF, get the ISPF primary screen, and then do
anything you want.

No matter how many STAXs have been issued by user programs,
sufficient attention interruptions can reach the TMP's attention
routine, and this will terminate all the stacked tasks and return
control to the TMP.

To fix this problem, clearing TSBSTAX of TSB can stop TCAS
receiving any other further attention.

* THIS PROGRAM IS MODIFIED FROM TSOLOCK (ISSUE 22)

* MODIFICATION:                                                       *
*   1: USE RACINIT MACRO FOR TOP SECRET ENVIRONMENT
*
*   2: ZERO OUT TSBSTAX TO PREVENT BREAKAGE BY HITTING
CONSECUTIVE    *
*      ATTENTIONS(ATTN KEY). RESTORE TSBSTAX AFTER PASSWORD

PROBLEM TWO

When 'TSOLOCK' appears on the screen, you can hit ATTN and
then PA1 key almost simultaneously to break the command, ie
you do not need a password to unlock your TSO.

When the PA1 key is hit before the second STAX is re-issued, the
attention is handled outside of IKJRINIT.  Hence the command is
broken.  This can be avoided by writing another program to issue
the first STAX and then link to the IKJRINIT.

*  THIS IS THE FRONT END OF IKJRINIT(TSOLOCK) TO PREVENT THE
BREAKAGE *
*  BY HITTING ATTN AND PA1 KEY SIMULTANEOUSLY                         *
