Console SYSLOG viewing and printout


OVERVIEW

The console SYSLOG file for MVS as delivered by IBM is very small and has the
following drawbacks:

1    When viewing the SYSLOG file with SDSF option LOG, you are only seeing
about one hour's worth of entries.

2    The SYSLOG output goes to class X interspersed with all other job output in
class X.

3    The SYSLOG output gets produced very often and is only about five pages
long, interspersed with all other class X jobs on the printer; or someone must
change each SYSLOG job on the SDSF held output screen to another class, on a
daily basis.


RECOMMENDATION

It would be advantageous to assign a specific class for operations and have all
SYSLOG output and any other output for the operations staff to go to that class
(maybe class O).  Also, it would be nice to have all the SYSLOG output
automatically go to this designated class.


SOLUTION

To send all SYSLOG output to class O (for operations) and increase the SYSLOG
file to be able to view with SDSF about two day's worth and also print a larger
SYSLOG listing to eliminate dozens of tiny (five page) listings, do the
following:

In SYSl.PARMLIB member IEASYSxx, where xx is your version (eg 00,01) add the
following two lines:

     LOGCLS=O,           (put SYSLOG to class O)
     LOGLMT=006000,      (to hold up to 6000 lines)

Then re-IPL your MVS system.
