Annual award winners
All the votes are now in for the 1989 MVS Update article of
the year awards.
The article that saved readers' installations most money was
judged to be Misleading information in RMF by Emmanuel
Vazana (May 1989).  The average sum saved by all subscribers
who sent in a voting slip was $141.67 each - that's equivalent
to a total saving of almost $250,000 for our combined
readership.
The article that saved readers most time was judged to be
DASD free space information by T T Whitehead (August
1989).  On average, this article saved all subscribers who sent
in a voting slip 2.47 hours each - equivalent to a total saving of
well over 4000 hours for our combined readership.
MVS Update saves the average subscriber's installation
$1962.50 and 43.69 hours a year.  May's issue saved readers
most money (an average saving of $263.89).  August's issue
saved them most time (an average saving of 4.3 hours).
The purpose of introducing these awards has been twofold - to
give public recognition to these authors and to enable us to
tailor MVS Update more accurately to the needs of our
subscribers by concentrating more on the types of article that
you have indicated are of most benefit to your installations.
We have been greatly encouraged by the response to these
awards and will be repeating them for 1990 articles.  If you
feel that you could contribute an article but are unsure of how
to go about it, please contact the editor, Steve Piggott, through
any of the addresses shown on page 2 for a free copy of our
Notes for contributors.
We extend our congratulations to Mr Vazana and Mr
Whitehead - the $2000 prizes are on their way to you now.
Our thanks also to all readers who took the trouble to vote.
