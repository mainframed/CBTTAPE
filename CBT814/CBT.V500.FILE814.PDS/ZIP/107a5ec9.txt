Disabling RACF in a stand-alone environment

I would like to propose an alternative method of disabling
RACF when building a stand-alone MVS system to that shown
in the article Creating a mini MVS system - further comments
in the October 1991 issue of MVS Update.

I agree with the writer of the earlier article that it is very useful
to have a stand-alone MVS system with RACF disabled, as this
may make any recovery much simpler.  There is also a
possibility that RACF itself may be corrupt in some way,
preventing the use of your normal SYSRES pack.

To disable RACF I first ZAP bit 0 of byte 0 of the ICHSECOP
CSECT of the ICHSEC00 and ICHSEC07 load modules.  This
procedure is documented in the System Programmer Library
(SPL) RACF 1.8 manual, Chapter 6, RACF Options, in a
section called Bypassing RACF initialization processing.

The job I use to perform the ZAP is:

//AMASPZAP JOB (9999),'NEIL HAWKINS',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H
//VERIFY   EXEC PGM=AMASPZAP
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=H
//SYSLIB   DD DSN=SYS1.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR,VOL=SER=STARES,UNIT=3380
//SYSIN    DD *
    NAME ICHSEC00 ICHSECOP
    VER 0000 0000,0000,0A
    REP 0000 8000,0000,0A
    NAME ICHSEC07 ICHSECOP
    VER 0000 0000,0000,0A
    REP 0000 8000,0000,0A
/*

If you do this and no more, the system will issue failsoft
messages for every resource protected by RACF that is
accessed.  This requires an operator intervention to verify each
access that is required by replying to the relevant message.

To eliminate the failsoft messages I use a short RACHECK
pre-processing exit (ICHRCX01).  This is also documented in

Chapter 8, RACF installation exits, of the previously
mentioned manual.

The job to perform this should be similar to:

//ZTSNLHA  JOB (999),'NEIL HAWKINS',MSGCLASS=H,CLASS=R
//  EXEC ASMHCL
//C.SYSIN    DD *
         TITLE 'ICHRCX01 - RACHECK PREPROCESSING EXIT'
* SEE MVS/XA SPL: RESOURCE ACCESS CONTROL FACILITY
*     CHAPTER 'RACF INSTALLATION EXITS'
* ICHRCX01 IS ENTERED WHEN THE RACHECK MACRO IS USED.
* EXIT FUNCTION IS TO BYPASS RACF PROCESSING, TELLING THE EXIT
* TO PASS A RETURN CODE BACK TO THE CALLER THAT SIMULATES
* SUCCESSFUL RACF PROCESSING.
* WITHOUT THE EXIT THE ROUTER WOULD IN A SYSTEM WITHOUT RACF DROP
* THROUGH TO NORMAL SECURITY PROCESSING (EG PASSWORDS), WHICH
* CAUSES CATALOG ACCESS PROBLEMS. ICHRCX01 MUST BE LOCATED IN LPA.
ICHRCX01 CSECT
* NOTE: NO PROGRAM BASE NEEDED, AS NO SYMBOLIC NAMES USED
         SAVE  (14,12)                 SAVE CALLER'S REGS
         RETURN (14,12),RC=8           SET RETURN CODE FOR RACHECK
         END
//L.SYSLMOD DD DSN=SYS1.LPALIB(ICHRCX01),DISP=SHR,
//       UNIT=3380,VOL=SER=STARES

Please note a CLPA IPL will be required to install the exit as it
resides in SYS1.LPALIB.

During an IPL at the point where RACF is usually initialized
the following message:

ICH502A SPECIFY NAME FOR PRIMARY RACF DATA SET SEQUENCE 001 OR 'NONE'

will be issued because RACF has been disabled and no RACF
database defined.  You should reply 'NONE'.  This enables
you to have unlimited access to any RACF protected resource
and no failsoft messages will be issued.

The examples given apply to MVS/XA Version 2.2 (JBB2220)
and RACF Version 1.8 (HRF1802).
