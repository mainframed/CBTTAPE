A program to accept operator commands

The following code allows a program to accept operator
console MODIFY and STOP commands.  It uses the Command
Scheduling Control Block (CSCB) and Command Input Buffer
(CIB) to find information.  It invokes the MVS QEDIT macro
to manipulate the control blocks as well as to allow or disallow
the use of MODIFY commands.  The CIB contains a pointer to
an Event Control Block (ECB) which is posted when a
MODIFY or STOP command is issued.
