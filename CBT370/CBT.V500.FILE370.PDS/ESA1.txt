                August 28, 1989

                Dear Sir,

                I found Mr. Golob's article in the August TS very
                interesting.   However, since we are running
                ESA, I dumped IEFAB4B0 and found that it had been
                changed and moved above the 16M line.   All of
                the displacements in the ZAP had to be changed,
                and the field TCBDCBTD had changed from a halfword
                to a fullword causing changes to PATDDLOP.

                IEFAB4A2 has also been changed quite a bit.   It
                has also moved above the 16M line and has been
                expanded.   Register 10 that was used to get a
                pointer to the DSAB is now used as a base register
                and register 9 is used to point to the gotten area
                that contains DSABPTR.   Our current RMID is
                UY19485 from 8805 and, at this level, the
                displacement from register 9 to DSABPTR is X'148'.
                Other RMID's could be UY90275 from 8807 or UY33681
                from 8903.   The X'148' will work with them too.
                I found the new pointer in a MVC instruction at a
                displacement of X'9E' into IEFAB4A2.   The
                instruction is MVC   DSABPTR,SIOTETIO or
                X'D2039148E094'.   I think that this instruction
                could be used to check for pointer changes in
                future PTF's.

                The USERMOD that I applied is attached for the use
                of other ESA readers.   Our PUT level is 8808.
