//***FILE 635 is from a REXX which is a mass renaming tool for      *   FILE 635
//*           multiple datasets at once.  Give this REXX two        *   FILE 635
//*           arguments, old dataset prefix and new dataset prefix. *   FILE 635
//*           The REXX will generate a list of TSO RENAME state-    *   FILE 635
//*           ments to rename all the datasets with the old name    *   FILE 635
//*           prefix to the new name prefix.  Add a third argument  *   FILE 635
//*           ( EXEC ), and the REXX will actually attempt to carry *   FILE 635
//*           out the renames, unless of course the old dataset     *   FILE 635
//*           names are allocated, or the new dataset names already *   FILE 635
//*           exist.                                                *   FILE 635

//*           Cool tool.  Potentially very powerful and very useful *   FILE 635
//*           when you need it.  But don't give it to the public.   *   FILE 635
//*           For system doctors only!                              *   FILE 635
