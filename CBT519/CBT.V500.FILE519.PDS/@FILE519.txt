//***FILE 519 is from Sam Golob, and contains a system to compare   *   FILE 519
//*           the status of tapes in CA-1 (TMS - Tape Management    *   FILE 519
//*           System) with the status of the corresponding volume   *   FILE 519
//*           names (numbers) in VTS (IBM's Virtual Tape System),   *   FILE 519
//*           which looks, to MVS, like a 3494 Tape Library.        *   FILE 519
//*                                                                 *   FILE 519
//*           This, essentially, is an audit system between TMS     *   FILE 519
//*           (CA-1) and the VTS.                                   *   FILE 519

//*           There is some installation-dependent code in the      *   FILE 519
//*           last program, which is the actual audit program       *   FILE 519
//*           that compares the TMS data with the VTS data.  All    *   FILE 519
//*           the other programs (I think) can run anywhere.  I     *   FILE 519
//*           have included our alphanumeric volser information,    *   FILE 519
//*           our TMSUX2E and TMSUX2U exits, as well as a TMSBLDUE  *   FILE 519
//*           report to show our actual tape ranges.  Installation  *   FILE 519
//*           dependencies are roughly marked in the TMLIBAUD code. *   FILE 519
