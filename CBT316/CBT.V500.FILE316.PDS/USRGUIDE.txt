                 MVS TECHNICAL INFORMATION MANUAL

    The MVS Technical Information Manual (TIM) is for  users  of
    2ISG's   MVS/JES2  system.   It contains the basic tailoring
    information to use this system, procedures  for  processing,
    backup  and  recovery.   It complements the vendor technical
    manuals available  from  the  product  vendors  and  is  not
    intended to replace them.

    This manual  is   one  of  four  2ISG   publications.  These
    publications  may  be  obtained  by  sending  a  request  to
    2ISG/DR.    Existing  2ISG   users  with  printers which can
    access a 2ISG  IBM computer can also acquire copies of these
    manuals directly from the computer.  Procedures are included
    in this manual.

    The other three 2ISG  publications are:

    GENERAL INFORMATION  MANUAL  (2ISGM   171-1).   This  manual
    describes  the  concept of operations at  2ISG,  its history

                             Chapter 1

                       USE OF THE MVS SYSTEM


    1-1.  INTRODUCTION.
        a.  This manual provides the basic technical  standards,
    conventions,   and  procedures  applicable  to   2ISG's  MVS
    system.   They  should  be  followed  to   maintain   system
    integrity,    improve   performance   and   satisfy   client
    requirements.

        b.  Prerequisites for understanding the material in this
    manual are:
            -  A general knowledge of computers.
            -  A knowledge of how to use your terminal.
            -  A general knowledge of MVS/TSO basics.
            -  A general knowledge of Wylbur basics.

        c.  The software packages available on  the  MVS  system
    are  fully  described in 2ISG's Services,  Capabilities, and
    Technologies, a pamphlet available from  2ISG.   A  list  of
    these  products  currently  supported  on  the MVS system is
    located in Attachment 1.

        d.   The  hardware  available   to   users   and   their
    corresponding JCL parameters are listed in Attachment 2.

    1-2.  THE MVS SYSTEM.

        a.  The OS/VS2 MVS  (Multiple  Virtual  Storages) system
    available  at  2ISG   is  a fully supported IBM product.  It
    provides both a timesharing and a batch environment.

        b.  TSO (Time Sharing Option) is an integral part of the
    MVS system.  Through this facility, users can make extensive
    use of the resources and perform many functions without  the
    intervention   of   a  central  operator.   In  addition  to
    interactive processing, batch jobs can be submitted and  its
    output  reviewed  through  the  use  of   TSO.   Interactive
    System  Productivity  Facility   with  Program   Development
    Facility (ISPF/PDF) is a productivity tool  available on TSO
    for users of IBM 327X or compatible terminals. ISPF/PDF is a
    menu-driven editor that also has many utility fuctions.

        c. Online Business Systems (OBS) Wylbur is a  system for
    for manipulating various kinds  of text:  computer programs,
    manuscripts,  letters,  etc.   For  such  texts, it provides
    on-line interactive text editing capabilities that allow the
    user to create text, change and correct it,  and  search and
    display  it.  It  has  facilities  for  remote job entry and
    and retrieval from  WYLBUR terminals.  Associated with these
    capabilities,  a user  may also inquire  about the status of
    their  jobs in the  system,  cancel  jobs that are executing
    or waiting for  execution,  and  purge  jobs that are in the
    print queue.

        d.  JES2 (Job Entry Subsystem 2)  is  also  an  integral
    part   of  the  MVS  system  that  provides  many  functions
    including job entry, job scheduling, on-line  services,  and
    job  output.   The Job Control Language (JCL) is the primary
    means of communication in the batch environment.

        e.  For additional  information  about  virtual  storage
    concepts  refer  to  IBM  manual  "Introduction  to  Virtual
    Storage in Systems 370", form GR20-4260.

    1-3.  STANDARDS, CONVENTIONS  AND PROCEDURES.

        a.  Standards and conventions are widely used  terms  in
    ADP  to  designate  similar concepts.  In this manual we use
    the word standard to designate the rules or procedures  that
    are  subject  to enforcement; the term convention is used to
    describe the rules and procedures that are normally accepted
    methods in  industry  but  not  necessarily  enforced.   The
    conventions  are  stated  as  2ISG   recommendations  to all
    users.  Deviations from standards are not permitted.

        b.  2ISG  imposes very few restrictions on  the  use  of
    MVS,  its components, and available products.  The functions
    of the system programmer are reserved to the 2ISG  technical
    personnel who provide maintenance, tuning and  upgrading  of
    all supported products.

        c.   The  standards  that  2ISG   has  established  have
    minimal impact  on  your  processing  workload  and  provide
    enough  flexibility  for  all users to incorporate them into
    their own standards.  Naming and usage  standards  apply  to
    both TSO and batch processing.

        d.  Some of the  most  important  standards  imposed  by
    2ISG  are related to proper identification of resources used
    by each one of our users.

                             Chapter 2

            2ISG  STANDARDS, CONVENTIONS AND PROCEDURES

    2-1.  COST CODES. 2ISG  assigns a two character alphanumeric
    cost  code  to  each user organization when a client project
    order is accepted.  This cost  code  is  used  by  2ISG   to
    identify   all  cost  data  created  by  the  use  of   2ISG
    resources.  This code is also used by 2ISG  to identify  the
    organization  and  location of the user.  The 2ISG  assigned
    cost  code  must be used in all job  names,  data set names,
    and other places indicated in this manual.

    2-2.  PROJECT CODES.  A project code  is  a  four  character
    alphanumeric  code,  assigned  at  the  time  a  project  is
    accepted, that identifies a specific Client Work Order which
    has  been  authorized for  processing  at  2ISG.   This code
    must  be  used  in  the JCL job  statement  of all  computer
    jobs associated with the project.  The cost of the resources
    utilized  by  all  projects  is  accumulated by the assigned
    project codes through 2ISG's accounting system.

    2-3.  REMOTE ID's.  Remote-id's are assigned  by  2ISG   for
    all   remote   stations.   The  remote-id  assigned  to  the
    equipment at your site is used on the ROUTE  statement,
    and  on certain TSO parameters for
    directing output to your printer.  2ISG  defines Remote-id's
    as unique numbers,  but  they  can  also  be  equated  to  a
    user-provided destination-id which can be more meaningful to
    you. The Vtam Print System (VPS) allows users to utilize IBM
    326X,  328X,  or  5210s (or compatible)  as remote  printing
    devices. These types of printers are used with a DESTID name
    in a ROUTE statement.

    2-4.  USER ID'S.

        a.  A user-id is a seven character code assigned by 2ISG
    to each  user.   This  user-id  has  the  following
    format:   "PPPPXXX".  The "PPPP" represents the Project code
    associated with the client organization. The "XXX" is a
    unique  character  identification for a specific user within
    the client organization. The four character project code is
    not for most cases used for billing of resources. In a few
    instances where accounting information is not available,
    then the project code portion of the userid will be used to
    identify the billing resource.

        b.  The User-id is required to logon to  TSO.   You  may
    also  use  the  same user-id on the jobs that you submit for
    batch processing.

    2-2                            2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985




        c.  OBS Wylbur users are assigned a  seven  character
    userid consisting of a four character project code  followed
    by three character initials.

    2-5.  PASSWORDS.  Passwords are assigned  to  each  TSO  and
    Wylbur user by 2ISG.   The unique combination of user-id and
    password allows access to the system, its resources and user
    data and therefore should be guarded from unauthorized use.

    2-6.  JOB NAMES.

        a.  The "jobname" is a field on the JOB  statement  that
    consists of 1 to 8 alphanumeric or national characters.  The
    first  two  characters must be a valid cost code assigned by
    2ISG.   The rest of the name is a unique user-provided name.
    Special characters and blanks are not permitted.

        ------------------- examples --------------------
        //ABPRINT  JOB (accounting-field),....etc
        //BCTEST   JOB (accounting-field),....etc
        //CCl23456 JOB (accounting-field),....etc

            The first two characters in each example, i.e.,  AB,
            BC,  CC,  are the Client's Cost Code.  The remaining
            characters in each  name  are  unique  user-provided
            names.

        b.  The job names should follow the standards  described
    above.   However, we strongly recommended the use of the TSO
    or Wylbur
    user-id plus an alphanumeric character as a job name.   This
    permits  you  to  review  the  output  of  your  job on your
    terminal through TSO or Wylbur.

    2-7.  DATA SET NAMES.

        a.  Permanent data sets must be identified by  a  unique
    name  and  must adhere to the 2ISG naming standards and
    the rules stated on the IBM  OS/VS2  JCL  Manual.   Data set
    names created at 2ISG  must have the following format.


                -----format--------
               UUUUUUU.XXX......
1
    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                           2-3





            where:
            UUUUUUU     is the first qualifier  field  which  is
                        seven (7) characters long.
            XXX.....    is  the remaining 36 positions of the
                        dataset name field. It must conform to
                        IBM naming conventions for fully
                        qualified dataset names.
            NOTE:       Under  TSO  the  last  qualifier   field



            (1) The first qualifier field (UUUUUUU) must be your
    user-id.

            (2) TSO and Wylbur can automatically prefix dataset
    names
    with  your user-id when you allocate data sets and therefore
    conforms to the  standard  stated.
1
    2-4                            2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985


        b. Users may choose a second format for dataset name
    naming. This standard is available for users who do not have
    TSO or Wylbur access to the system and do not have a userid.

              -----format-----
              CC.PPPP.xxx.....

            where

            CC        is the authorized two character
                      costcode valid at 2ISG.

            PPPP      is a four character project code valid
                      for 2ISG. This project code will be the
                      the project code used to bill this DASD
                      space.

            xxx...    is the remaining 36 characters of the
                      dataset name. It must conform to IBM rules
                      for coding dataset names.

        c.  The entire data set name (DSNAME or  DSN)  field  is
    limited  to   44  characters including  the periods  between
    index  levels.   Each  index  level  must  begin   with   an
    alphabetic or national character and can  not  contain  more
    than   8  characters.  Special characters SHOULD NOT be used
    in the DSNAME.  Note that the system allows an  index  level
    beginning  with a non-alphabetic character when writing, but
    will not allow it when you try to read it.  The  number  and
    order  of index levels should be minimized and structured to
    utilize space within the catalog data set efficiently.   The
    lowest  index  level should always be unique.  Tape data set
    names should not be longer than 17  characters.   Therefore,
    if  you  use  a  DSN  longer  than  17  characters, only the
    rightmost 17 characters will  be  written  to  the  standard
    label  on  the  tape.   Refer  to  OS/VS  Tape Labels manual
    (GC26-3795).

        ---------examples: disk data set name-------------------
        //MYDISK  DD DSN=AB01JFK.MISSION1.DATA,DISP= ... etc

        ---------examples: tape data set name-------------------
        //MYTAPE1  DD DSN=AB01JFK.MISSION1.DATA, UNIT= ... etc

            The name written on the tape label will be the  last
            17 characters of the DSN, i.e., JFK.MISSION1.DATA

        d.  Special data set names are reserved for system  use.
    Users  MUST  NOT  create  any  data  sets  starting with the
    following names:  SYS1, SYS2, IPO1, and IPO2.

        e.  Temporary data sets do not require a data set  name,
    but  one may be used if desired or if there is more than one
    temporary data set.

        -------examples: disk temporary data set name---------
        //TEMP01  DD DSN=&name,DISP= ... etc
        //TEMP02  DD DSN=&&name,DISP= ... etc
        //TEMP03  DD DISP=... etc (Note:  no  DSN  is  used  or
                                   required).

        f.  Partitioned Data sets (PDS) require  a  member  name
    enclosed in parenthesis.

        ---------example: partitioned data set name-----------
        //MYPDS DD DSN=AB01JFK.MISSION2.DATA(PARTS),DISP=...etc.

    2-8.  DISK STANDARDS.

        a.  ONLINE DISK.

            (1) Online disk is  defined  as  the  storage  media
    which  is  mounted  permanently  and always available to the
    system and its users.  Since disk (short for online disk) is
    always available, operator  intervention  is  not  required.
    This  availability  allows  faster  throughput  and  in some
    cases, sharing of data sets.

            (2) Data sets on disk must be catalogued and conform
    to  the  naming  standards   described   in   this   manual.
    Maintenance  and  recovery of data sets on disk is performed
    by 2ISG  as described in the backup and  archive  procedures
    in this manual.

        b.  MOUNTABLE PACKS.

            (1)   Mountable  packs  are  defined   as  the  disk
    storage media that is not permanently mounted and  therefore
    not   immediately   available.    It    requires    operator
    intervention  to mount it when it is requires.  Packs (short
    for mountable packs) are not shared and are reserved for the
    exclusive use of one client.

            (2) The use of packs is restricted and the trend  is
    to  eliminate  them   altogether   in   the   near   future.
    Requirements  for  packs  should  be reviewed thoroughly and
    converted to disk.

            (3)  The  user  is   fully   responsible   for   all
    maintenance,  backup,  and recovery of data stored on packs.
    Data sets stored on packs do  not need  to  conform  to  the
    naming  standards,  but we strongly recommend that you do to
    make a transition to disk easier.

        c.  GENERATION DATA SETS.

            (1) Users creating new Generation Data  Sets  (GDGs)
    should be aware that the default  for the disposition (DISP)
    parameter is  (NEW,DELETE).  Thus, if users do not specify a
    "normal   termination"   disposition   subparameter  (second
    subparameter of the DISP parameter), the new GDG will NOT be
    created.

            (2)  Jobs  not  specifying  a  "normal  terminating"
    disposition subparameter for new GDGs will be  flagged  with

1
    2-6                            2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985





    the  JCL error message "INCOMPATIBLE DISP AND DSN PARAMETERS
    FOR DD ddname" and not executed.

            (3) For more information regarding  GDGs,  refer  to
    the MVS JCL manual and the MVS Utilities manual.

        d.   TEMPORARY  DATA SETS. Data sets  are   defined   as
    temporary when they are created and deleted in the same job.
    MVS  relieves  the user of the effort required to search for
    available  space,  allocate  a  data set, and   delete   the
    temporary  data set at  the end of a job.  You can write and
    then read back a temporary data set in a program or pass  it
    to  another  program or a series of programs in a batch job.
    MVS scratches temporary data sets immediately after the  job
    ends. Users are prohibited from placing work files on the
    disks made available for temporary scratch space using
    permanent dataset names. Temporary datasets on scratch disks
    should always begin with '&&'.


        e. PARTITIONED DATA SETS (PDS).
            (1) TSO and OBS Wylbur users are encouraged  to  use
    partitioned  data sets (PDS) instead of sequential data sets
    (PS).  The ease of use and savings in  disk  space  are  two
    main advantages of a PDS.  A PDS consists of many individual
    sequential  data  sets identified as members of a directory.
    TSO, ISPF/PDF, and Wylbur provide
    facilities to  display of all the  member
    names  of  a  PDS  and therefore you do not have to remember
    each individual name.  It's far easier to remember one  data
    set name than 350 individual names.

            (2) The minimum space required for a data set  on  a
    disk  is  one track and is allocated in multiples of tracks.
    Efficient use of track space is obtained when the  space  is
    used  completely.   Sequential  data  sets  can  waste space
    because they do not always occupy a full  track;  each  data
    set  could  waste  some of the space available to it.  A PDS
    makes full use  of  the  space  available  by  treating  all
    members  as  one big data set and keeping track of the start
    and end points of each one within the data set.

            (3) As an example, any  TSO  user  who  does  source
    development  can  allocate  a  PDS  and  place  all  the JCL
    jobstreams, source programs, etc.  in one PDS.  A  user  can
    have  a  PDS  with  over  350 members occupying 50 tracks of
    space.  If these were individual data  sets  then  it  would
    take
1
    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                           2-7





    at least 350 tracks of space, probably a lot  more.

            (4) A characteristic  of  a PDS is  that  the  space
    occupied by a member is only used (written) once.  Each time
    you  save a data set, new space is required and the previous
    space is flagged as unavailable.  Therefore, the PDS must be
    compressed  to eliminate the 'dead' space when there  is  no
    more space available.  Fortunately, there are many  easy  to
    use  TSO  and OBS Wylbur commands available to maintain your
    PDS data sets.  An  important  consideration  is  to  create
    enough  space  for  the  directory  when  the  data  set  is
    allocated.

    2-9.  LIBRARY USAGE.

        a.  A user of a system is primarily interested in  three
    major libraries:  Job Control Language PROCEDURE library,
    SOURCE library, and the
    LOAD library.  These libraries are partitioned data sets and
    can be either public or private.  All user libraries must be
    private.  To access libraries, you must specify them on your
    JOB with one of three DD statements:
    The JOBLIB DD statement,
    which  specifies  a load module library
    for the entire JOB, a STEPLIB
    DD statement, which specifies a  load module library
    for  a  job  step, or the PROCLIB DD card to access private
    JCL libraries.

        b. Users can place source files, jcl procedures, and
    job
    control language run streams in one source library. This
    library is card image in form. To access the JCL procedures
    a user would use a PROCLIB data definition (DD) card. JCL
    procedures are access by using a non-IBM product called
    'Easy Proclib' from Software Corporation of America.

        c. Load module libraries are treated differently than
    source programs. Members are placed into load module
    libraries using the IBM Linkage Editor program. Once These
    programs are in the load module library, the user will use
    a JOBLIB or STEPLIB DD card to invoke the program. When
    either  one  of these DD statements, the
    operating system concatenates the  private  library  to  the
    system libraries. When the system searches for a program, it
    will first look in the private library, and  if  not  found,
    will then look in the system libraries.

        d.  2ISG  provides backup and archiving support for  the
    libraries like any other partitioned data set on permanently
    mounted disk. This backup and restore is only on the
    dataset level and not on the member level.


    2-10.  CATALOGUED PROCEDURES (PROCS).

        a.   Types  of  Catalogued  Procedures.   A  "catalogued
    procedure" (PROC) is a set of JCL.  This means that sets  of
    Job Control Language statements
    are stored on data sets and can be used
    over  and over by many users.  It takes as little as one JCL
    statement to invoke a PROC.  JCL in a PROC  is  then  merged
    with  the  user's JCL statements when the job passes through
    the converter/interpreter phase. There are three  different
    types of catalogued procedures.

            (1) System procedures. These procedures are provided
    by 2ISG  for all products such as FORTRAN, COBOL, SAS, etc.
    These JCL procedures are stored in a special dataset called
    'SYS1.SADSC.PROCLIB' and are maintained by 2ISG.
1
    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                           2-9





            (2)  Compiler/Assembler.   This  set  of  catalogued
    procedures includes all of the  JCL  necessary  to  use  the
    higher  level  compilers  provided with the Operating System
    (COBOL, FORTRAN, etc.).  These procedures will be  described
    in more detail later in this section.  JCL for the compilers
    is also stored in 'SYS1.SADSC.PROCLIB'.

            (3) User Procedures.  This category includes all  of
    the  catalogued  procedures  created  by users for their own
    user-created  and  maintained  particular  projects.   These
    procedures are stored in a card image PDS.
    Users can access their PROC
    libraries using 'EASY PROCLIB'.

        b.  Using  PROCS  to  Compile  a  Program.   Many   2ISG
    clients use catalogued procedures to compile their programs.
    The  procedure  name  on  the  EXEC  statement specifies the
    particular procedure to  be  invoked.   The  names  for  all
    compiler  procedures  have  been standardized.  Each name is
    composed of three parts:

            - The first part of the name describes the  language
              being invoked.

            - The second part of the  standardized name  defines
              the  level  of  the  compiler  or  assembler being
              executed.

            - The third part of the  catalogued  procedure  name
              designates the steps that are to be executed.

        The procedure name is constructed by combining the three
    parts.   For  example,   to  execute  the  VS COBOL compiler
    followed   by  linkedit   and   execution,   the
    procedure name would be COBUCLG.

            (1)  Language and Level.

            (2) Step  Names.   The  stepnames  of  a  catalogued
    procedure are defined by the name of the program executed in
    that  step.   The  level of the compiler or assembler is not
    used in the step name.  It's important to know the stepnames
    to override DD statements in the step.


    The stepnames used in catalogued procedures are:

    2-11.  TAPE STANDARDS.  Magnetic tape volumes used  at  2ISG
    fall into three general categories:

     .  2ISG  Tapes (S-tapes) are those that are used and stored
        exclusively at 2ISG. These tapes are managed on the  MVS
        system by  a  software  product called   Tape Management
        System  (TMS) from UCCEL Corporation, Dallas, TX.  These
        tapes may not leave 2ISG except to be moved  to off-site
        storage.

     .  Transit Tapes (T-tapes) are created at 2ISG  for use  on
        systems outside of 2ISG.  These tapes are provide upon
        request by 2ISG (for a fee) for you to transmit data
        to other computer installation. These tapes are assigned
        a T-number for internal tracking while assigned to a
        user.
1
    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          2-11





     .  Foreign  Tapes  are  user's  tapes  sent  to  2ISG   for
        processing. These tapes are assigned a T-number for
        internal tracking while at 2ISG. Users may read or write
        on these tapes depending on needs. Once the tape leaves
        2ISG, it is deleted from the inventory.

    Rules for use of tape volumes are described in this section.

        a.  2ISG TAPES (S-TAPES).

            (1)   S-tapes   are    permanently   assigned    for
    input/output processing at 2ISG  on the MVS system.  S-tapes
    are monitored and controlled by 2ISG. All S-tapes are
    controlled by the Tape Management System (TMS) from UCCEL,
    Corporation, Dallas, TX.  TMS is a realtime tape management
    system to provide the control, reporting, and facilities to
    manage data center tape resources while providing absolute
    tape data set protection.

            (2)  S-tapes contain IBM  standard  internal  labels
    written  at  the highest density of the drive on which it is
    used, normally 6250 bpi.  The label contains an "S"  in  the
    first  position  and  the  tape number in the second through
    sixth positions of the volume serial number field.

            (3) The only tapes that can be catalogued  at  2ISG
    are  the  S-tapes.  Newly created S-tapes can  be catalogued
    when they are created.  If they  are  not  catalogued,  then
    they must be saved through some other means of TMS.
    A monthly storage charge is charged for each
    'saved' tape reel.

            (4)  The user has the responsibility to release
    tapes when the data is no longer  required.   This
    may be done through the JCL DISP parameter if catalog control
    was used to save the tape or tapes may be released by
    executing the TMS TSO command.

            (5)  Users who build Generation Data Groups (GDGs)
    should always insure there is one entry in the group. 2ISG
    will periodically clean the catalogs of empty indexes which
    will delete empty GDGs.

            (6)  Bypass Label Processing (BLP) is not allowed on
    S-tapes to reduce accidental or unauthorized access of  user
    data.

            (7) Clients should ensure that all saved
    tape data sets do not go unused  for a period of  365
    days, the tape must either be released or copied to
    another tape
1
    2-12                           2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985





    at least once a year using a 2ISG utility,  e.g., IEBGENER.
    If tape data sets are not copied, refunds will not
    be honored if magnetic tape failure occurs.

            (8)  2ISG   maintains  offsite  storage for S-tapes.
    Tapes containing data  of  historical  value  that  must  be
    retained  beyond  one year without use may be unreadable due
    to  humidity  changes,  dust,  etc.   The   user   has   the
    responsibility  to  copy  these tape volumes at least once a
    year.  2ISG  will  not  be  responsible  for  tape  problems
    associated with tapes that have not been  used  for  over  a
    year.

            (9)  Use  of DISP=(NEW,DELETE) on any tape device is
    not recommended since the tape is immediately made available
    for  use  by another job.  DISP=(NEW,KEEP) is recommended so
    that the tape will be removed when last used by your job.

            (10) Multiple cost codes are not allowed on a single
    tape  volume.  Data sets that do not have the same cost code
    as the first one on a specific tape volume will  be  deleted
    by 2ISG.

            (11) The retention period of any  tape  data sets is
    the responsibility of the user.

            (12) Users  with multiple  files on  tape should not
    mix retention periods for those files.

            (13) All tapes  created  on  2ISG   MVS  system  for
    subsequent use at 2ISG must be saved  when initially created
    via the normal TMS procedures.

            (14) All tapes that are not saved will be considered
    eligible to become scratch volumes.

            (15) All tape  data sets saved at 2ISG must  conform
    to the tape data set naming convention as documented in this
    manual.  Tape data  set  names that do  not conform  to 2ISG
    standard will be deleted from the TMS  system.

            (16) Jobs run by users which abend do not have newly
    created tapes saved for them. These tapes are placed in a 3
    day hold limbo status.

        b. TRANSIT TAPES (T-TAPES).

            (1) 2ISG provided T-tapes are  created to  transport
    tape
    data  sets  to external (non-2ISG) systems.  Generally, the
    tape data set is created at 2ISG, the tape  is  sent  to  a
    user  specified destination, the tape is processed, and then
    the tape  is  returned  to  2ISG.    The  T-tape  series  is
    composed of permanently assigned control numbers
    to fulfill these requirements and are
    designated by a number preceded  by  the  letter  "T"  (e.g.
    'T00001').

            (2) How to use a T-tape.  The user  must  request  a
    T-tape  by  calling the 2ISG  tape librarian.  The librarian
    will then select the T-tape and tell you the number  of  the
    tape assigned to you.  You can use the T-tape number in your
    JCL  to  create the data set.  The librarian will record all
    information into the TMS system.
    When the tape is  sent  to  the
    specified destination, one copy of the form  will  accompany
    the  tape.   A second copy of the form will be kept at 2ISG
    for control purposes.  A tape can only be removed from 2ISG
    with an AF Form 903.  One form must be used  for  each  tape
    being  removed.  Instructions for completing the AF Form 903
    are contained in AFM 171-300, VI.

            (2) All T-tapes assigned to users cause a monthly
    fee to be assessed to the users account. This monthly fee
    continues during the time the tape is away from 2ISG. Once
    the tape is returned and becomes a scratch, the fee stops.

            (3) The user has the responsibility  to  return  all
    2ISG provided
    T-tapes  within 30 days.  Tracer action will be initiated on
    all tapes which have not been returned within  this  period.
    A surcharge will be assessed to the user after a period of
    60 days for all unreturned tapes.

            (4)  2ISG provided T-tapes that are returned     are
    immediately scratched upon return. Users who return 2ISG
    provided T-tapes should not place any data on these tapes
    for ultimate use at 2ISG.

    T-tapes should not be used for general input/output
    processing at 2ISG; the  S-tapes  are  available  for  that
    purpose.

        c.  FOREIGN TAPES (USER TAPES).

            (1) Foreign tapes are user's tapes sent to 2ISG  for
    processing.   Foreign  tapes  must  be  accompanied   by   a

    transmittal   form  or  they  will  not  be  received.   The
    transmittal form will be signed by 2ISG Tape Librarian
    and returned to the sending organization as a receipt.

            (2) A minimum  of  six  hours  of  climatization  is
    required prior to using any tape volume.

            (3) After fifteen (15) calendar days
    foreign tapes  will  be
    returned  to  the  owner  organization.   The  tapes will be
    accompanied by a shipping document for your information.

            (4) Foreign tapes must  not  be  catalogued  on  any
    system catalog.

            (5) External Tape Labels.  2ISG  requires the use of
    external tape labels on foreign and T-tape  volumes.   These
    labels  describe  the  contents  of  the   tapes   and   all
    information  necessary  to  complete  the  label  should  be
    supplied to the 2ISG tape librarian. This information should
    include the owner's name, address, city and state plus zip
    code, contact telephone number, and four character project
    code for billing purposes.

        d.  TAPE RETENTION.

            (1) Each client two character cost code
    will be  placed  into
    the  system  catalog as an index.  This index must then
    be followed by a valid project code which will be used for
    billing purposes for the tape.
    This index can    be used
    as the primary index of a data set name so that all  catalog
    entries  for  a  specific  user  can  be easily queried.  To
    retain a tape being built in a specific job  the  user  can
    identify  the  unique  data set name  in the data definition
    statement and specify the disposition DISP=(NEW,CATLG,KEEP).
    This also applies to dataset names that contain a valid
    TSO or Wylbur userid.

            (2) For example, DSN=AB.AB01.MYDATA would descibe a
    data set belonging to cost code AB, project code AB01
    with  a  unique   name   of   MYDATA.    In   the   catalog,
    AB.AB01.MYDATA would point to a specific volume on which the
    data set is contained.

    //ddname DD DSN=AB.AB01.MYDATA,DISP=(NEW,CATLG,KEEP),
    //          DCB=BLKSIZE=8000,UNIT=TAPE62

            (3) The above causes the operator to  mount  a  nine
    track  S-tape and the system will enter the volume number of
    that tape in the  system  catalog  under  the  data set name
    AB.AB01.MYDATA.  No further action is needed for this volume
    to be retained.

        e.  USING CATALOGUED TAPES.  After  a  tape  volume  has
    been catalogued on the system, any future reference to it in
    later  jobs  is done by entering the DSN and DISP=OLD on the
    DD statement.  The tape catalog  keeps  track  of  the  tape
    numbers.   In the following example, if the volume number in
    the catalog for AB.AB01.TAPE.DATA is S00165, the system will
    ask for tape number S00165 to be mounted  on  a  nine  track
    drive for the job that is processing it.

        f.  OFFSITE STORAGE FOR DISASTER TAPES.

            (1) 2ISG maintains a facility physcially separated
    from the computer center for the storage of computer tapes
    that are deemed as critical. A user may elect to have a
    S-tape that has been properly saved through TMS taken to
    this off-site storage facility.

            (2) Tapes that are flagged going to offsite storage
    are carried by courier to the facility on the next duty day.

            (3) The fee that 2ISG charges for retaining
    information on S-tapes is applicable to all tapes taken to
    offsite storage.

            (4) Once a tape is in the off-site facility, it will
    remain there until released by the user. The releasing
    (scratching) of the tape causes its automatic return to 2ISG
    for reuse.

            (5) Users may request a return of the tape to extract
    information from the tape without releasing the tape. Users
    should call the 2ISG tape librarian to schedule the tape's
    return for the next duty day. Once the tape has physcially
    returned to 2ISG the tape librarian will CHECKIN the tape
    to the TMS system and notify the users of its availability.
    The user has one days use of the tape before TMS automatically
    schedules the tape to return to offsite storage. TMS is very
    protective of tapes in offsite storage and will not allow the
    tape to stay at the central computer site for more than one
    day. If a user requires the tape for a second day, then the
    same procedure must be used in notifying the tape librarian
    to have the tape returned from offsite storage.

    2-12.  BACKUP STANDARDS.

        a.  Backup procedure.  The objective  of  backup  is  to
    provide  a  reliable  recovery  capability  for your on-line
    data sets that may be  destroyed  through  data  corruption,
    media failure,  or disaster facility destruction.  Data sets
    are not removed from  on-line  disk  as  is  the  case  with
    archiving  procedures.   The procedures employed by 2ISG  to
    backup the users data on a regular basis are:  Each evening,
    every data set that was updated that day is dumped to backup
    tape  and  stored in the 2ISG  tape library; once each week,
    all on-line disks are dumped  to  tape  (whether  they  were
    updated or not) and stored at our off-site facility.
1
    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          2-17





            (1)  These  procedures  provide  the  capability  to
    restore your  data  from  these  tapes  with  the  following
    limitations:

         .  Any  version  of  a data set from one to 45 workdays
            old in one-day increments.  If you  updated  a  data
            set every  day for the past 45 days, you can restore
            any  of  those  data  sets  by   requesting  it  and
            specifying the "as.of" date.

         .  Offsite storage of backup tapes  provides  data sets
            which may be up to one week old and up to 6 weeks of
            dumps are maintained.

            (2) This procedure provides ample backup  capability
    making total data loss extremely remote.

        b.  Restore backup procedure:  To have a backup copy  of
    your dataset restore, please call the Customer Service
    Division at 2ISG prior to 1500
    (CT)  the  day  before  it's needed.  Identify the
    data set name, the "as-of" date and specify that it is to be
    restored  from backup.  The requested data set(s) will be on
    disk by 1000 the following duty day (unless  retrieval  from
    off-site storage is required, which takes an extra day).

        Clients  that  require   more   stringent   backup   are
    encouraged  to  create  their own backups and schedule their
    own off-site storage.

    2-13.  ARCHIVE STANDARDS.


        a.   Archive  Procedure.   The  objectives  of   archive
    procedures  are  to make efficient use of on-line disk as  a
    storage  and facilitate necessary housekeeping.  The user is
    relieved of the expense of paying expensive on line  storage
    charges   for   infrequently  used  data sets and  forgotten
    obsolete data sets are automatically removed.

        b.  The procedures employed by 2ISG  are:  the data sets
    that have not been used for 100 calendar days are copied  to
    tape  and the disk space occupied by them is returned to the
    system; data sets that are not  restored  from  the  archive
    tapes  within  one year (365 days) are automatically deleted
1
    2-18                           2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985





    from the archive system. Capability for restoring data  sets
    from  archive tapes is provided.  Data sets that are deleted
    from archive tapes cannot be restored.

        c.  Users that require to keep data for  over  one  year
    without  access  (as  is frequently the case with historical
    data sets) are encouraged to use magnetic tape
    as a cost effective storage
    media.

        d.   Identification  of  Archived  Data Sets.  You   can
    determine  if  your  data set has been archived by using the
    P ARCHIVE DSG command list through TSO.

        e.  Restore Procedure.  To have  a  data set (or  group)
    restored to disk, simply contact the 2ISG  Customer Services
    Division by  1500  hours  (CT)  the  day before it's needed.
    Please identify the  data set names  (or  group  qualifiers)
    exactly, and specify that the data set(s) are to be restored
    from archive.  The requested data sets will be  on  disk  by
    1000  the following morning.  The 100 day clock for restored
    data sets starts over again from the  beginning,  since  the
    restore action counts as an access.


    2-14.  PRINTING STANDARDS.

        a.  Printing at 2ISG.

            (1) All printing produced by users at 2ISG  must  be
    coordinated     through     the     corresponding    account
    representative.  You  can  arrange  to  have  all  printouts
    either  thrown  away or shipped to you.  You may change this
    option from time to time to suit your needs.   All  printing
    costs  and  shipping  costs are charged to the corresponding
    user.

            (2) All printouts must  be  properly  identified  to
    expedite  shipping  them  to  the proper user. All users are
    identified with a 'MailCode' for disposition of output
    printed or punched at 2ISG. This MailCode is automatically
    placed on all output when it is generated. Users who want to
    create output at 2ISG for delivery to another users site by
    way of the receiving users MailCode, may do so. Contact your
    customer representative for the appropriate codes for the
    potential recevier. Many users have there own remote printing
    stations and VPS printers. Users who desire to transfer
    print may directly route output to any printer in the
    2ISG Network.

    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          2-19





            (3)  It's  always  good  practice  to  use a /*ROUTE
    statement on your JCL to indicate to the  system  where  you
    want to have the printout.  Some TSO commands cause printing
    at  2ISG   if  you  don't  specify  the  destination.  These
    listings may be lost if not properly identified.   Therefore
    be aware when and where log and list data sets get printed.

            (4) SPECIAL FORMS.   The  FORMS=  parameter  on  the
    JOBPARM  statement permits you to specify special forms on a
    job.  Some important points to keep in mind are:

            .  Xerox  8700  page  printer  has many special form
               capabilities.  Users  would  like  to utilize the
               special forms available on the Xerox 8700, should
               contact  their  customer  representative  for the
               current offering of special forms.
            .  SYSOUT  CLASS (or MSGCLASS) must be C for special
               forms printed on the impact IBM 3203-5 printers.
            .  If  CLASS=C  then specify FORMS on the JOBPARM or
               appropriate DD statement and FCB or UCS as is
               applicable to the special form.
            .  SYSOUT related parameters on /*JOBPARM become the
               default for all SYSOUT with the same class.
            .  A DD statement can override any SYSOUT related
               parameters.

            (5) Retention period for spooled print output.   MVS
    users  create  print  data  sets  (Output) on the spool disk
    volume.  The print data sets can be HELD so it can be viewed
    through TSO or it can be printed  immediately  at  either  a
    remote  or  local  printer.   Held  output can be viewed and
    later released for  printing.   Held  print  data  sets  are
    purged from the spool  after seven (7) days.

            (6) The retention period is fourteen (14)  days  for
    spooled   print   data   sets.   All  print  data  sets  are
    automatically purged from the spool  after  14  days.   This
    keeps the spool disk volume clean.

        b.  Printing at Your Location.

        Printing  at  your  location  requires  that  all   your
    printouts are properly routed to your terminal printer using
    a corresponding remote-id (or destination-id).

            . Batch Jobs. Use the Route statement.
            . TSO Sessions.  Use the remote-id on all commands
              that generate printouts.
            . Wylbur Sessions.  Use the remote-id on all commands
              that generate printouts.
            . ISPF/PDF  Sessions.   Use  the  remote-id  on  all
              screens that contain  the  printer  id.   Use  the
              ROUTE   statement  on  the  screens  that  contain
              pre-formatted JCL for printing data.

           JOB CONTROL LANGUAGE STANDARDS AND CONVENTIONS

    3-1.  JCL Statements.

        a.  Job Control Language (JCL)  statements  provide  the
    system  user  with  a means of communicating and influencing
    the scheduling of work,  allocating  system  resources,  and
    transmitting  control  information in the batch environment.
    JCL is nothing more than  a  shorthand  notation  system  of
    writing  your  job  processing requirement and communicating
    them to the  computer.   Therefore,  all  MVS  users  should
    understand  JCL.   For  additional JCL information, refer to
    IBM OS/VS2 MVS JCL Manual.

        JCL Format       STATEMENT       FUNCTION
        -------------   ------------   -------------------
        //jobname JOB     JOB         First statement in job.

        //stepname EXEC   EXEC        First statement in each
                                      jobstep.   Specifies   the
                                      program or procedure to be
                                      executed.

        b.  A typical jobstream  consists  of  a  group  of  JCL
    statements  arranged in a logical order.  Every job requires
    a job identification  (JOB)  statement,  an  execute  (EXEC)
    statement   to  identify  the  prosessing  program  of  each
    jobstep, and Data Definition  (DD)  statements  to  identify
    every  data  set  used  in  each  jobstep  by the processing
    program.  Figure 3-1 lists the most  common  JCL  statements
    and explains their function.

        c.  A JOB is the  entire  set of  JCL that starts with a
    JOB statement.  A JOB may consist of one or  several  STEPS.
    Each  STEP  is  a  group  of  related  JCL that executes one
    program.  The JCL statements in  one  jobstep  describe  the
    data sets and  parameters  that  the  executing program will
    require.

    3-2.  JOB STATEMENT.

        a.  Every job must  have  a  JOB  statement  which  must
    conform  to  the  standards described in this section and in
    the IBM MVS JCL manual.  The  JOB  statement  indicates  the
    beginning point for a job and provides important information
    about  the  user, the resources and conditions required, and
    other data that applies to the entire job as default  values
    if they are not specified in the jobstep.

        ---------------------format-----------------------------

        Where:

        (1) "jobname"  is  the  user-given  name  of   the   Job
            according to 2ISG standards.

        (2)  JOB is the keyword that identifies the statement.

        (3) "accounting-field" is  a  group  of  accounting  and
            identification  data required on all Job statements.
            It  is  positional  parameter  which   lists   basic
            information  needed  to  process  the  job.  The two
            parameters are mandatory and  must  be  enclosed  in
            parenthesis.    Figure  3-2  shows  the  "accounting
            field" format used at 2ISG.

    3-3.  EXEC STATEMENT.  The EXEC statement is used at 2ISG
    in  the  same manner as specified in the IBM MVS JCL manual.
    Attachment 3 of this manual lists the valid  parameters  and
    the corresponding default values used at 2ISG.

        a.  Examples

        //STEP1 EXEC COBUCLG         Executes a procedure

        //STEP2 EXEC PROC=COBUCLG    Executes a procedure

        //STEP3 EXEC PGM=MINE        Executes a program

        //STEP4 EXEC PGM=MINE,       Executes a program in a
        //      REGION=1024K         region of 1024K

        //STEP5 EXEC PGM=MINE,
        //      TIME=(10,15)

        //STEP6 EXEC PGM=MINE,
        //      TIME=10

        //STEP7 PGM=MINE,
        //      TIME=15

        //STEP8 EXEC COBUCLG,
        //      TIME.COB=5,TIME.GO=15

        b.  Overriding, Adding,  and  Nullifying  Parameters  on
    Exec  Statements.  The changes are in effect only during the
    current execution  of  the  procedure.   The  PGM  parameter
    cannot  be  changed.  All overriding, adding, and nullifying
    parameters for one procedure step must be made before  those
    for  the next step.  If you code an EXEC statement parameter
    and omit the term PROCSTEPNAME,  the  parameter  applies  to
    every  step  in the procedure, with the old parameter values
    being nullified.  The exception is the parm parameter  which
    applies to the first step with the later EXEC statement parm
    values being nullified.

    3-4.  DD (Data Definition) STATEMENT.  The DD  statement  is
    used at 2ISG  in the same manner as specified in the IBM JCL
    manual.   Attachment  3  of  this  manual  lists  the  valid
    parameters  and  the  corresponding  default  values used at
    2ISG.

        a.  Types of DD Statements.

          - Instream Data Sets
            //DATA1 DD  1
            (Data can not contain "//" in cols 1-2)
            /*

            //DATA2 DD DATA
            (Data can contain "//" in cols 1-2)

        c.  How to Specify Input Data sets.

    The basic steps in specifying an input data set  through JCL
    are:

            (1) Give the name of the data set.

            (2) Specify the unit from which the data set  is  to
    be  read,  unless the data set is cataloged or passed from a
    previous step.

            (3) Specify the volume from which the data set is to
    be read (including unlabelled tape data  sets),  unless  the
    data set is cataloged or passed from a previous step.

            (4) Give label information if necessary.

            (5) Indicate status  of  data  set  and  disposition
    after its last use.  (OLD/KEEP or DELETE or UNCATLG or CATLG
    or PASS).

            (6) Give DCB parameters if necessary.

        d.  How to Specify Output Data Sets.

            (1) Assign a name to the data set.   (Simple,  Fully
    Qualified, Temporary, System Assigned)

            (2) Specify the device on which the data set  is  to
    be written.

            (3) Give label information, if necessary.

            (4) Specify the volume on which the data set  is  to
    be  written, if desired.  (Volume Serial Number, Same Volume
    as another data set)

            (5) Allocate space to a  disk  data  set.   (Tracks,
    Cylinders, or Physical Blocks)

            (6) Indicate status  of  data  set  and  disposition
    after its last use.  (NEW, MOD/DELETE, KEEP, CATLG, or PASS)

            (7) Give DCB parameters, if necessary.

        e.  The DISP

            (1) The DISP parameter contains three subparameters:
    initial, normal termination,  and  abnormal  termination  as
    shown below:

                  INITIAL     NORMAL     ABNORMAL
                 --------    -------     --------
            DISP=(NEW      ,DELETE     ,DELETE)
                  OLD      ,KEEP       ,KEEP
                  SHR      ,PASS       ,CATLG
                  MOD      ,UNCATLG    ,UNCATLG
                           ,CATLG

            (2)  Defaults:
            If no DISP specified, then DISP=(NEW,DELETE,DELETE)
            If DISP=OLD, then DISP=(OLD,KEEP,KEEP)
            If DISP=SHR, then DISP=(SHR,KEEP,KEEP)

        f.  Overriding, Adding, and Nullifying Parameters on  DD
    Statements.   The  changes  are  in  effect  only during the
    current execution.  The overriding, adding,  and  nullifying
    parameters  for one procedure step must be made before those
    for the next step.  All overriding DD  statements  within  a
    single step must be in the same order as those DD statements
    within  the  procedure.   In addition, all overrides must be
    done prior to any DD card additions within each step.

            PARAMETER  =  *.DDNAME
            PARAMETER  =  *.STEPNAME.DDNAME
            PARAMETER  =  *.STEPNAME.PROCSTEPNAME.DDNAME

            LEGAL PARAMETERS ARE:

            //   DD   DCB=(*.STEP1.DD1,.....),

            //   DD   DSN=*.STEP2.PROCA.DD3,.....

            //   DD   VOL=REF=*.DD2,.....

    3-5.  PROC STATEMENT.

        a.  The PROC statement  can  be  used  in  an  in-stream
    procedure or a cataloged  procedure.   It  can  be  used  to
    assign  default  values  to  Procedures. It cannot  contain:

                .  EXEC statements that reference other PROCS
                .  JOB, delimiter, or null statements
                .  JOBLIB DD statements
                .  DD * or DD DATA statements.

        b.  Complete rules for coding can be found in the OS/VS2
    MVS JCL manual.

        c.  Overriding DD Statements in  Catalogued  Procedures.

            (1)  DD statements in catalogued procedures  can  be
    overriden  when  the  PROC  is  invoked.    The  subject  of
    overriding statements is extensive and users are  encouraged
    to read the IBM JCL manual since it covers the subject  very
    well.   There  is  an  infinite  combination  of   procedure
    overrides which can be made by the user.

            (2) The overriding DD statements must occur  in  the
    same order as the catalogued DD statements in the procedure.
    Catalogued procedures for high level languages have their DD
    statements   in  the  same  order  as  they  appear  on  the
    corresponding programmers guide.  Note  that  the  job  will
    execute   even  if  the  DD  statements  do  not  match  the
    catalogued DD statements but the results may not be the ones
    desired.

            (3)  Examples of Procedure Usage.  Some of the more
    common procedures are shown.

                (a)  Example of Assembly only.

                //stepname   EXEC  ASMFC
                //ASM.SYSIN  DD DSN=source-data set ... etc
                /*

                (b)  Example of VS Fortran compile and LNKEDT.
                Linkage editor output saved on my.loadlib.

                //stepname     EXEC  FORTVCL
                //FORT.SYSIN   DD DSN=source-data set ... etc
                //LKED.SYSLMOD DD DSN=my.loadlib(testprog) ...
                /*

                (c) Example of COBOL/VS  compile and execute.
                (linkage editor step is not required)

                //stepname  EXEC COBUCG
                //COB.SYSIN DD DSN=mysource ... etc
                //GO.SYSIN  DD *
                      (Execution Data)
                /*

            (4) Example:  VS Fortan  compile with  linkedit  and
    execution.   The  region  size required is 700K and the time
    for execution is 10 minutes.

           //stepname    EXEC  FORTVCLG,REGION.GO=700K,TIME.GO=10
           //FORT.SYSIN  DD  DSN=source-data set ... etc
           //GO.SYSIN    DD   *
                     (Execution Data)
           /*

            (5) Execution of an object deck previously  produced
    by the COBOL/VS compiler.

                //stepname     EXEC  COBULG
                //LKED.SYSIN   DD   *
                     (Object Deck)
                /*

    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          3-11





        e.  How to Get Object Decks.

            (1) Since most jobs executed at  2ISG   do  not  get
    object  decks  out  of  compilers, the catalogued procedures
    have not been set up with a punch output data set in compile
    steps.  However, it is easy for the user to  add  this  data
    set.  The same instructions apply to all languages.

            (2) To get an object deck out  of  the  compiler  or
    assembler,  simply give a PARM field of DECK to the compiler
    and then supply a SYSPUNCH statement with the  specification
    SYSOUT=B.

                //             EXEC  ASMFC,PARM.ASM=DECK
                //ASM.SYSPUNCH DD    SYSOUT=B
                //ASM.SYSIN    DD    *
                     (Source Deck)
                /*

                //              EXEC  FORTVC,PARM.FORT=DECK
                //FORT.SYSPUNCH DD    SYSOUT=B
                //FORT.SYSIN DD *
                       (Source Deck)
                /*

        f.  How to Use Procedures for Multiple Compiles.

            (1) All of  the  catalogued  procedures  for  higher
    level languages have been set up with standardized temporary
    data  set  names  so  that  multiple  compile  steps  may be
    executed followed by a single linkedit and go.

            (2) You can also compile the output  from  different
    language   compilers  if  you  make  sure  that  the  proper
    libraries are supplied to the linkage editor.  Some examples
    follow.

                (a)  FORTRAN with assembly language subroutine.
                //stepname   EXEC ASMFC
                //ASM.SYSIN  DD *

                //stepname   EXEC FORTVCLG

    3-6.  JES2 CONTROL STATEMENTS.

        a.  JES2 control statements  are  used  to  control  the
    input  output,  and  processing  of a program.  JES2 control
    statements request more efficient use  of  resources.   They
    are  identified  by  a  /* in columns 1 & 2.  They cannot be
    continued (except for the OUTPUT  statement)  and  therefore
    use  multiple  statements  when  needed.   Furthermore, JES2
    control statements are not allowed in catalogued procedures.
    If  you  place  JES2  control  statements  in  a  catalogued
    procedure, they will be ignored.

        b.  Each of the JES2 commands is designed to  accomplish
    specific  functions.  The chart below shows the general uses
    of the JES2 commands.

    3-7. THE JOBPARM STATEMENT.

        a.  The JOBPARM permits specification of the following:
            .  Estimated number of output statements.
            .  Number of copies of printed output desired.
            .  Job default print or punch forms.
            .  Number of output lines on each page.
            .  Estimated number of output lines.
            .  Room Number.
            .  Estimated job execution time.
            .  Printing of JES2 JOB LOG.

            (2) /*JOBPARM SYSOUT parameters are only  a  default
    for  a  job.  A DD statement can override any SYSOUT related
    parameter on the /*JOBPARM statement.


    3-8.  OUTPUT STATEMENT.   An /*OUTPUT statement  is  a  JES2
    logical  extension  of a SYSOUT DD statement.  It allows the
    programmer to specify additional information (parameters) of
    a SYSOUT data set.

         -  No. of copies of data set
         -  Destination device of output
         -  Special forms required
         -  Forms Control Buffer (FCB) (3203-5 only)

                        have  a  corresponding forms-id field as
                        shown in the following example.

    3-16                           2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985





        ----------------example-------------------
        /*OUTPUT ABCD FORMS=6PRT       <---(1)
        /*OUTPUT XYZ1 FORMS=2PRT       <-----(2)
        //SYSERR   DD SYSOUT=(A,,XYZ1) <-----(2)
        //myrep1   DD SYSOUT=(A,,ABCD) <-------------(1)
        //myrep2   DD SYSOUT=(A,,ABCD) <-------------(1)

        NOTES: (1)  The DD statements for "myrep1" and  "myrep2"
                    will  use the parameters on the first OUTPUT
                    statement since the  forms-id  specified  in
                    the DD statement is "ABCD".
               (2)  The forms number  is  coded  on  the  OUTPUT
                    statement and not on the DD statement.

            2.  If there is no associated OUTPUT statement,  the
    forms  id  is  taken  from  the  SYSOUT= parameter on the DD
    statement.  OUTPUT statements may be continued by specifying
    a forms id of '*' in the continuation OUTPUT statement.

        ----------------examples------------------------
             /*OUTPUT 1234 FORMS=3PRT
             /*OUTPUT *    DEST=RMT92

    Both of the above OUTPUT statements would be associated with
    DD statements which specify SYSOUT=(A,,1234).  Some  SYSOUT
    related  parameters may be specified on the DD statements as
    well as on the OUTPUT statement.  However, parameters  which
    are  allowed on the SYSOUT DD statements vary from operating
    system to operating system.  Therefore, users are advised to
    use OUTPUT statements.  The parameters on OUTPUT  statements
    are the on all operating systems.


    3-9.  ROUTE STATEMENT.  The ROUTE statement is used to route
    print or punch output to any local device, remote device,
    remote terminal, or VPS printer.

            ---------------format---------------------
            /*ROUTE PRINT xxxxxxx

        where xxxxxxx is a predefined printer:
              LOCAL   is the 2ISG local impact or X8700 printer
              RMTxxx  is a remote printer
              vvvvvv  is a VPS printer name

            /*ROUTE PRINT LOCAL

            /*ROUTE PRINT RMT221

    3-10.  SYSOUT CLASSES.

        a.  A SYSOUT class is a way to group system output  with
    similar  attributes similar to way job execution classes are
    classified together.  Note however, that their  function  is
    different;  SYSOUT classes specify characteristics of output
    print data sets.

        b.  The SYSOUT class can be specified on the "MSGCLASS="
    parameter of the JOB statement and the  "SYSOUT="  parameter
    of  the  DD statement.  Additional SYSOUT control parameters
    are specified on the JOBPARM and OUTPUT statements.

            (1) The message class (MSGCLASS=) parameter  may  be
    used  to  specify  the  default  SYSOUT class for all system
    output associated with  the  job.   The  MSGCLASS  parameter
    controls the SYSOUT class of the following SYSOUT data sets:

            . JES2 job log
            . Output JCL
            . System messages

            (2) The SYSOUT class may also be  specified  as  the
    first   sub-parameter  in  the  SYSOUT  parameter  of  a  DD
    statement.

        -------------examples-------------------
        SYSOUT=A             Requests SYSOUT class A.
        SYSOUT=(U)           Requests SYSOUT class U.

        Note. If the SYSOUT parameter contains several
        subparameters, parentheses are required.

            (3) To  alter  SYSOUT  characteristics  in  a  class
    different  from  that specified in MSGCLASS you must specify
    the desired information either on the DD statement or on  an
    appropriate OUTPUT statement.

1
    3-18                           2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985





            (4) The default  MSGCLASS  is  A  for  jobs  entered
    through a card reader, either local or remote.  Otherwise it
    is  class  Z  (trash).   If  you do not include the MSGCLASS
    parameter  on  your  job  statement,  your  JCL  and  system
    messages will be  assigned  the   default   message   class.
    Special  forms  are  illegal  in  SYSOUT class A.  Thus, you
    should be careful to include  the  appropriate  MSGCLASS  on
    your  job  statement  when  specifying  special  forms  on a
    JOBPARM.  The valid SYSOUT classes  and  an  explanation  of
    their usage is found in attachment 2.

        c.  DUMMY SYSOUT CLASS.  Using a dummy SYSOUT  class  is
    the  equivalent of specifying DD DUMMY on a DD statement.  A
    dummy SYSOUT class is discarded by the operating system.  Do
    not  confuse  dummy  SYSOUT  classes  with  COPIES=0.   When
    COPIES=0 is specified, the data is spooled and is accessible
    via TSO even though the SYSOUT is not printed.  Data from  a
    dummy  SYSOUT  class  is  not available via TSO.  If a job's
    message class is set to a dummy SYSOUT class in the job log,
    JCL output and system message will not  be  printed.    2ISG
    will  be  unable  to  assist  in resolving problems for jobs
    which specify a dummy SYSOUT message class.

        -----------------examples-------------------
        SYSOUT=Z    is a dummy class for print & punch data sets

        d.  SYSOUT CONTROL PARAMETERS.  The most  common  SYSOUT
    parameters are the:

        . Forms id (FORMS=) which controls the type of paper (or
          statements).
        . UCS-ID  (UCS=)  which  controls  the   character   set
          available.
        . FCB-ID (FCB=) which controls the vertical  spacing  or
          "forms control".
        . Attachment 2 gives a list of all parameters related to
          SYSOUT,  a  brief  description of each, their defaults
          and where these parameters may be specified.

    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          3-19





            (1)  The Forms Id (FORMS).

            (2) The Universal  Character  Set  (UCS).   The  UCS
    parameter  is  used  to request a print chain or train to be
    used for printed SYSOUT.

         .  2ISG has two printers with  PN trains.
         .  The PN train has four sets of special characters and
            is faster for printing output which contains a large
            amount of special characters.
         .  2ISG has a Xerox 8700 page printer with upper and
            lower case capability with no need to specify the
            UCS parameter.
         .  Any printing of output with the QN (upper and lower
            case) print band on impact printers requires prior
            arrangements with 2ISG.

            (3)  The  Form  Control  Buffer  (FCB).    The   FCB
    parameter specifies the vertical spacing of the printout.

         .  The number of print lines per inch (6 or 8 lpi).
         .  The line numbers where special  skips  are  located,
            e.g., which line is the top of the page.
         .  The  FCB  image  is  somewhat  dependent  upon   the
            dimension of the paper being used.
         .  The most common FCBs used are listed in Attachment 2.

    3-11.  USING INTERNAL READERS.

        a.  The internal reader interface in JES2 is  a  special
    SYSOUT  data  set  that  can be used to submit jobs to JES2.
    The records generated by your program are sent to JES2 input
    processing instead of spooling them for later printing.

        -----------------example-------------------
                 SYSOUT=(A,INTRDR)

        b.   The  keyword  INTRDR,  as  the  second   positional
    subparameter,  is  required.   The first subparameter of the
    SYSOUT keyword determines the default message class  of  all
    jobs  submitted  via  this internal reader ('A' in the above
    example).  The default routing for  jobs  submitted  via  an
    internal  reader is the same as the routing of the job which
    allocates the internal reader.

    3-12.  DCB PARAMETERS FOR SYSIN;SYSOUT DATA SETS.

        a.  As  standard  practice,  programmers  should  insure
    valid   DCB  parameters  have  been  included  on  all  Data
    Definition (DD) statements for SYSIN and SYSOUT  data  sets,
    unless  they  are  included within the program, i.e., within
    the  file  description  for  COBOL  or  the  DCB  macro   in
    Assembler.   Without  these parameters, jobs will abnormally
    terminate or produce unpredictable output.

        b.   The  JES2  Spooling   Subsystem   allows   complete
    flexibility  in  specifying the characteristics of SYSIN and
    SYSOUT data sets.

        c.  The MVS/JES2 system does not provide these  defaults
    and places the burden of supplying correct parameters on the
    programmer.  Problems occur in two places:

            1.  The SYSIN taken from a disk data set  may  cause
    an  S001  abend  if  proper  logical  record length (LRECL),
    blocksize (BLKSIZE), and record  format  (RECFM)  parameters
    are  not  specified  in  the DD statement for the SYSIN data
    set.

            2.  When writing to a SYSOUT  data  set,  if  LRECL,
    RECFM,  and BLKSIZE parameters have not been provided by the
    programmer, the output will  appear  garbled  when  printed.
    All  users need to take steps to include these parameters on
    SYSIN and SYSOUT DD statements.

        d.  Parameters related to SYSOUT may be specified  on  a
    /*OUTPUT statement to control various characteristics.

    With JES2, the SYSOUT parameters on  a  /*JOBPARM  statement
    will  apply only to SYSOUT directed to the same SYSOUT class
    specified in the MSGCLASS parameter on  the  JOB  statement.
    (MSGCLASS  is  used to specify the SYSOUT class to which the
    job's JCL and system message will be directed.)

        -------------------example------------------------------
     //jobname  JOB (accounting-field),name-field,MSGCLASS=A ...
     /*JOBPARM  F=2PRT
     //stepname EXEC PGM=myprog
     //OUT1     DD SYSOUT=A
     //OUT2     DD SYSOUT=(B,,STD.)
     //OUT3     DD SYSOUT=(U,,XF02)

    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          3-21






    In the example above:
          . The MSGCLASS specified on the JOB statement requests
            that all JCL output and system messages for this job
            be assigned to SYSOUT class A.

          . The  /*JOBPARM  statement  specifies   2PRT   forms,
            requesting that the JCL system messages and SYSOUT=A
            output for this job be printed on special forms.

          . Any output written to the OUT1 DD will  be  assigned
            to SYSOUT class A and 2PRT print forms.

          . Any output written to the OUT2 DD will  be  assigned
            to SYSOUT class B and standard card punch.

          . Output written to  the  OUT3  DD  will  be  assigned
            SYSOUT  class  U  and will print on XF02 forms.

            (3) The following rules must be followed when  using
    JOBLIB and STEPLIB DD statements:

          - Never use JOBLIB or STEPLIB as a DD name  except  to
            specify a private library.

          - The JOBLIB  DD  statement  must  appear  immediately
            after the JOB statement.

          - The STEPLIB can be placed anywhere in the job step.

          - The JOBLIB DD statement  cannot  be  included  in  a
            catalogued  procedure but a STEPLIB DD statement can
            be included.

          - A STEPLIB DD statement can be referred to or  passed
            to a later JOBSTEP in the same job.

        e.   2ISG   CATALOGUED   PROCEDURES.    All   catalogued
    procedures  (PROCs) in SYS1.SADSC.PROCLIB, take advantage of
    the SYSOUT=* feature.  If you specify a SYSOUT class of * on
    a DD statement, the SYSOUT class for that DD statement  will
    be  taken  from  the  MSGCLASS  parameter  on the user's job
    statement.  A job using 2ISG  PROCs  can  direct  all  print
    output  to  special  forms, if desired.  There is no need to
    override every SYSOUT DD statement in the PROC to change its
    SYSOUT class or print characteristics.  The user simply sets
    the desired SYSOUT class on the MSGCLASS  parameter  of  the
    job    statement.     Optionally,    the    desired    print
    characteristics may be specified on a /*JOBPARM statement.

        f.  JOB MSGCLASS PARAMETER.  The MSGCLASS  parameter  is
    used  to  specify  one  of  two  types of SYSOUT processing:
    standard or Xerox 8700 print.

            (1)   Standard   processing   implies    that    the
    characteristics  of  the  SYSOUT generated by a job meet the
    default setup of the 2ISG impact printers.
    Those  defaults  are
    lined 11" x 14 7/8" paper with a  PN
    print chain and  FCB=6    (6 vertical print lines per inch).
    The message class used for standard  processing  is  A  (for
    standard print output) or B (for standard punch output).

            (2) Special processing is used when the operator  is
    required  to  set  up a printer or punch
    differently than the default
    (different form, print chain).  Message classes B and C can
    be used for special forms output.
    Classes C and B are the
    print  and  punch  classes,  respectively.   The  user  must
    specify  a valid form number known to 2ISG,
    FCB number for impact printer output if required,
    and a valid form number for  punch  output  on
    either  the  JOBPARM or OUTPUT statement as appropriate.  To
    indicate that SYSOUT is to be placed in a particular  SYSOUT
    class  and  the  JOBPARM  *  parameters  will be used as the
    default, the JOB and SYSOUT DD statements are coded:

        -------------------example-------------------------------
        //jobname  JOB (accounting-field),'name-field',MSGCLASS=A
        /*JOBPARM  FORM=6PRT
         .........
         .........
        //OUT1     DD SYSOUT=A
1
    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          3-23






    If the MSGCLASS and the SYSOUT class:
        .  agree:
            all output will be printed under the control of  the
            JOBPARM parameters.
        .  disagree:
            the JOBPARM parameters will not  affect  the  SYSOUT
            generated  in the differing SYSOUT class.  An output
            statement is needed to  specify  the  special  class
            characteristics.

        -------------------example------------------------------
        //jobname JOB (accounting-field),name-field,MSGCLASS=A
        /*OUTPUT LBLS FCB=6,UCS=PN
        /*OUTPUT * F=8004,LINECNT=0
        //OUT2 DD SYSOUT=(C,,LBLS)

        The SYSOUT class for OUT2 is "C" (special processing).

        The JCL listing will  be  placed  in  SYSOUT  class  "A"
    because the MSGCLASS is "A".

        The output statement specifies  the  characteristics  of
    the special output because the SYSOUT class differs from the
    message class.

        If the message class is absent from the  JOB  statement,
    MSGCLASS  "Z"  is  assumed for TSO and Wylbur submitted jobs
    and "A" for RJE submitted jobs. It is important for users to
    supply the appropriate MSGCLASS parameter for their jobs.

        An incorrect MSGCLASS can result in output being illegal
    and result in cancellation or processing delay.

    4-1.  Access to The MVS  System.   The  MVS  system  can  be
    accessed  in  several  manners  depending  on  the  type  of
    terminal   you   have   and   the  communication  facilities
    available.    The   following   figure    illustrates    the
    relationship  and  access  paths available to the MVS and VM
    systems.  VM is covered in 2ISG's  VM Technical  Information
    Manual.

        a.  TERMINALS.  Many different types  of  terminals  are
    used   to  access  MVS:   most  of  them  are  either  TTY's
    (line-at-a-time), Full-screen  CRT's  or  RJET  (Remote  Job
    Entry  Terminals).   The  terminals  must  have  one  of the
    following protocols to access the MVS system.

        . TTY (Teletype)
        . BSC (Bisynchronous)
        . SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control)

        b.  COMMUNICATIONS.

            (1) Terminals are either connected to  the  computer
    permanently  (leased  line)  or by dialing the corresponding
    phone number each time they are used (hence  called  dial-up
    or   switched).    Terminals  connected  permanently  simply
    require a logon procedure.

            (2) Dial-up.  The first step is to dial  the  system
    and  make  the  connection to the FEP (Front End Processor).
    You do this by calling the given phone  number.   After  you
    dial the number, you will hear a long tone, at this time you
    must  set  the  phone  on  "data mode".  The specific method
    depends on your type of phone and modem.   There  are  three
    common methods:

        .  Hanging the phone and setting a switch to data
        .  Lifting the exclusion key on the phone
        .  Pressing the hold button

    Refer to your specific equipment manual for operating
    details.

            (3) PDN (Public Data Network).   Accessing  the  MVS
    system through the PDN requires an additional "logon" to the
    network.  Your 2ISG  account manager will provide you with a
    PDN  vendor  manual  if  you  use this facility.  The manual
    contains the information you need to operate all aspects  of
    the  facility.   A  PDN  logon  procedure  consists  of  the
    following general steps:

        .  Dial a local number (node)
        .  Specify the type of terminal you are using to the PDN
        .  Type a PDN userid
        .  Type a PDN password

       c. TERMINAL SESSIONS.

            (1) After successful communication  to  the  FEP,  a
    logon  procedure  to  the system is required and is the same
    for dial-up as for  non  dial-up.   A  terminal  session  is
    relatively  simple:   a  terminal user identifies himself to
    the system and then issues commands to request work from the
    system.  As the session progresses, the user has  a  variety
    of  tools  available.   If any difficulty encountered, there
    are aids  such  as  on-line  tutorials  and  help  functions
    available.

            (2) After logging on to the system, you are ready to
    use the facilities of TSO or Wylbur.  The type  of  terminal
    that you use and the product that you want to use determines
    the  the  logon  procedure.   The available Logon procedures
    available for MVS are TSO and Wylbur.  The  TSO  environment
    makes  available to you all the TSO commands to perform your
    tasks.  ISPF/PDF is an IBM product that allows the same  TSO
    functions  in  a  menu-driven  environment  which  is  "user
    friendly".   Since  the  functions  are  the  same,  we will
    discuss the  functions  only.   New  users  of  MVS/TSO  are
    encouraged   to   use   the   ISPF/PDF   environment.   Some
    experienced users prefer the direct use of commands.

    4-2.  TSO LOGON.  After the terminal is on and  the  dial-up
    procedure has been performed (if needed), you can proceed to
    logon  to the system.  Additional information for particular
    types  of  terminals  can  be  found in the IBM TSO Terminal
    User's Guide.

        a.  FULL-SCREEN TERMINAL  (327X  compatible).   The  TSO
    Logon procedure consists of the following steps:

            (1)  The  following  screen  is  displayed  on  your
    terminal:

        b.  LINE-AT-A-TIME TERMINALS.  The following steps are
    needed to logon after the terminal is on and in ready
    status:

     User  enters:           TSO  Responds:
    ----------------         ----------------------------
      BTSO                   READY TO IBM
      LOGON                  IKJ56700A ENTER USERID -
      userid                 ENTER CURRENT PASSWORD FOR (userid)
      password               ENTER PROCEDURE NAME
      procedure name         (userid) LOGON IN PROGRESS
                             AT hh:mm:ss on (date)


            (1) TSO prompts you for a  procedure  name  ONLY  if
    your  userid has more than one procedure available.  If only
    one procedure is available to you,  then  TSO  will  execute
    that procedure for you. TTY TSO users should be using a
    logon procedure name of SADLOGON. Users of IBM 327X or
    compatible terminals will probably want to use the ISPF/PDF
    full screen editor. The logon procedure for ISPF/PDF is
    called SPFLOGON.

            (2) You may enter the LOGON and   userid
    all at once in the following manner and thus avoid having to
    wait  for  a  prompt from the system.  The following example
    illustrates this:

      LOGON userid

            The following example illustrates a complete  logon.
    The entries made by the operator are shown in lower case for
    clarity only.

        c.  DEFINING TERMINAL CHARACTERISTICS.

            (1) Terminal characteristics are  usually  specified
    only  when  you use the system for the first time.  However,
    they may be used at any time.  Two ways of  doing  this  are
    through  the  "TERMINAL" TSO command for TSO TTY users
    or through ISPF/PDF (option 0) for IBM 327X (or compatible)
    terminals.   Terminal  characteristics  should  be  verified
    with  your  2ISG   account  manager or the technical support
    personnel at your organization.

            (2) You may change the setting of the function  keys
    on  your  terminal  (if  you  have  327x  type  terminal) to
    simplify  the  most  frequently  used  commands.   The
    ISPF/PDF
    tutorial  shows  you  how to do it.  For example, if you use
    the "TE" (Text Entry) line command frequently, you can set a
    function key to do it.  This may save you a  lot  of  keying
    and is certainly easier.

        a.  LINE-AT-A-TIME TERMINALS.  In the following examples
    the commands entered by the user are in lower case  and  the
    system responses are in upper case.

        b.  The complete LOGON procedure will look like this:

        c.  The following numbers correspond to the steps above.

         1.     This message indicates that no valid switch
                characters were entered at connection time. This
                is normal for connecting to front-end processor
                for the first time.
         2.     WYLBUR is the valid sw-character to sign onto OBS
                Wylbur.
         3.     The system recognizes your message and responds
                with this greeting message.
         4.     The system asks for you to enter your OBS Wylbur
                USERID.
         5.     The system asks for your enter your password. Users
                of hardcopy TTY terminals will have the password
                blanked out on the paper.

                You are now ready to type Wylbur commands.

    4-4.  REMOTE JOB ENTRY (RJE).  RJE users  must  sign-on  and
    sign-off their remote station through the use of the sign-on
    and sign-off statements.

    0          1                                       7
    1          6                                       3
    /*SIGNON   Remotenn                                PASSWORD

    The /*SIGNON is required on  columm 1 through 8.  The
    REMOTEnn
    must be your remote ID assigned to your RJE. The 'password'
    must start in column 73 and must be have been assigned by
    2ISG prior to use. Passwords are required for dial RJEs.

    4-5.  ENDING A SESSION (LOGOFF).

        a.  TSO and Wylbur users may logoff by using the  LOGOFF
    command.   We strongly recommend that you logoff immediately
    after  completing  your  work.   This  helps   to   conserve
    resources  and  makes  them available to other users, and it
    saves your organization some charges.  TSO or Wylbur
    will be
    CANCELLED  automatically by the system if it is not used for
    a period of 30 minutes. Users who do issue the LOGOFF
    command and simply hanging up the phone on dial-up lines may
    not be cancelled automatically after the 30 minutes inactive
    period. This can occur if the user way in a loop. Simply
    hanging up the phone may not cause a disconnection.

        b.  TSO 'LOGOFF' is also accomplished by entering
    "LOGON". This allows you to logon to another TSO userid
    without a loss in communciation.

        c.  RECONNECT.  If your TSO session was  interrupted
    say  by a line error, you may return to where you were in
    your session with a LOGON RECONNECT command. If done soon
    enough after the interruption, you will to be returned
    to where you were before the problem occurred.

        d. Wylbur sessions are recoverable. All Wylbur users
    have a recoverable file allocated for them called
    'userid.ACTIVE' or the ACTIVE file. When an interruption
    occurs in a user's Wylbur session, the file that is being
    edited is saved in the ACTIVE file for that user. When
    the signs back onto Wylbur, the ACTIVE file should be
    copied to a permanent file and them the ACTIVE file should
    be scratched (refer to Wylbur Users Guide).

    4-6.  USING TSO AND ISPF/PDF.

        a.  TSO commands are grouped according to their function
    into eight categories.  A list of TSO commands available  is
    available  on  your terminal by typing 'HELP'.  The ISPF/PDF
    interface product is program that is  executed  in  the  TSO
    environment much like other products.  Most of its functions
    are  the  same  as  "native" TSO.  Figure 4-2 shows the main
    components of TSO and its relation to ISPF.

        b.  After you logon to TSO you can use TSO  commands  or
    execute CLISTS.  Most of the TSO commands are also available
    through   the  menu-driven  facilities  of  ISPF/PDF.   This
    interface is easier for the TSO beginner because it requests
    the specific  data  required  to  accomplish  the  task  you
    indicate to it.  Any problems, either in TSO or ISPF/PDF can
    be  resolved  most  of  the  time  with  the HELP facilities
    available.  You can make full use of this  function  in  the
    middle  of  a  task.   The  help function is structured in a
    hierarchy and you can determine the  levels  of  information
    you  need  to  solve  your  problem.   You  can  also become
    knowledgeable  very  quickly  using  the  tutorial  facility
    provided.

    4-7.  TSO COMMAND  GROUPS.   The  eight  groups  of  of  TSO
    commands   and   functions   are  listed  in  the  following
    paragraphs and correspond to the  letters  shown  on  Figure
    4-4.   The  following  list of commands are available to the
    TSO users.  To obtain more information on how to  use  these
    commands,  use  the  HELP  function  that TSO provides.  The
    following notes apply to some of the commands.

         #  Installed vendor products
         *  2ISG  supported when time permits.  low priority
         +  2ISG  extensions to existing commands and supported
            on a low priority basis

        a.  2ISG SUPPLIED COMMAND LISTS (CLIST).

            (1) Using Clist Data sets.  Clists  are  prearranged
    executable TSO commands, subcommands, and command procedures
    statements.  They are usually stored like any other data set
    and are useful  in performing frequently repeated functions.
    Clists  not  only  use  all  the TSO command language but in
    addition have facilities that give them high-level  language
    capabilities.

            (2) CLIST PERFORMANCE.   Preceding  the  CLIST  name
    with  a  percent  sign  (%) can reduce the amount of time to
    access it.  For example, to execute the CLIST named DOIT you
    can enter the command in one of two ways:

         DOIT    OR    %DOIT

         %DOIT IS THE RECOMMENDED WAY.

                (a) When any command is entered,  TSO  does  not
    know  if  it  is  a  valid  TSO command or CLIST.  TSO first
    assumes that it's a TSO command and therefore  searches  all
    libraries  that  can  contain  TSO  commands.  The number of
    libraries is large and will take considerable CPU time.   If
    the command is not found in the libraries, TSO then searches
    for  the  name  of  a  CLIST  library  allocated to the user
    (SYSPROC is the ddname).  If the CLIST library  exists,  TSO
    searches for the CLIST name.  If the CLIST is not found, TSO
    then  issues  a  "COMMAND NOT FOUND" message.  Therefore, if
    you issue a CLIST command, you can save all the CPU time and
    cycles used in the search through the TSO command  libraries
    by using the CLIST indicator (%).

                (b) The use of the % to prefix CLIST names saves
    processing  time,  improves  response  time,  and  decreases
    processing costs since the user pays  for  all  the  I/O  to
    search  TSO  command  libraries  when  CLISTs are used.  Any
    decrease in I/Os issued reduces user costs.

    4-8.  AVAILABLE PRODUCTS.

        a.  Software products are available  through  CLISTS  or
    are  accessed  through  batch  jobs.  CLISTS are provided by
    2ISG  to  access  some  of  these  products.   You  must  be
    familiar  with  the  product  that  you  want  to use before
    attempting to use it.  Your account representative can  help
    you  obtain  the  necessary  training  courses  and  manuals
    required for any of the supported products at 2ISG.

        b.  The rest of this chapter describes the use  of  some
    of  the  software  products  available on the MVS system.  A
    complete list is provided in attachment  1 and a description
    of  their  functions  can  be  found  in  2ISG's   Services,
    Capabilities, and Technologies Pamphlet.

    4-9.  How to use ISPF/PDF.   You  must  have  a  full-screen
    terminal to use ISPF/PDF.  ISPF supports program development
    in  Assembler,  Fortran,  and  PL/1.   ISPF  can be used for
    creating and maintaining data sets.   After  logging  on  to
    TSO, type in %NEWISPF after the READY message.

         ------------example---------
         READY
         %NEWISPF

        a.  The screen will be cleared and the primary menu will
    be displayed.  Select the option you  wish  and  hit  enter.
    ISPF  prompts  you for the information it requires to do the
    function you requested.  The first two lines of  all  screen
    displays  provide  basic  information about the function you
    are performing,  the current data set being  edited,  scroll
    parameters etc.

        b.   Error  messages  and  short  system  commands   are
    displayed on the upper right hand corner of all screens.  If
    you  are  in doubt about its meaning, you can use the 'help'
    function (PF1) to get more information  about  the  problem.
    Successive  use  of  the 'help' function will get you to the
    tutorial on the particular subject.

        c.  The line  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  displays
    warnings  and  reminders and other useful information to the
    terminal operator in reference to the controller,  terminal,
    and  communications.   A complete explanation of the symbols
    and text used in this  line  can  be  found  in  the  manual
    provided by the terminal vendor.

    4-9.  SYNCSORT.   SyncSort  is  a  sort/merge  program  with
    extensive  capabilities  beyond  the  normal sort functions.
    SyncSort can be executed  by  JCL or called from a  program.
    Refer to the SyncSort manuals for more details on its use.

        a.  Sorting Files.  The following example shows the  JCL
    statements required for a typical sort.

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    ------------------------------------------------------------
                Figure 4-5 Typical SyncSort JCL

        The example above indicates generalized  statements  for
    SyncSort.  Their use is as follows:

        EXEC identifies the  SyncSort  program.   Refer  to  the
            SyncSort  manuals  for the valid parameters that may
            be specified on on the PARM parameter.
        SYSIN identifies the data set  (or  input  stream)  that
            contains the SyncSort statements.
        SYSOUT defines the data set for the  SyncSort  messages.
            You  must  specify  this or the messages will not be
            printed.
        SORTIN defines the sort input data set.   The  data  set
            must  have  physical sequential organization or be a
            member of a partitioned data set.  Data sets may  be
            concatenated  together to the same SORTIN statement.
            The  concatenated data sets must  be  of  the   same
            blocksize  and  same  record  format.   Refer to the
            SyncSort manuals for  details  for  variable  length
            records.
        SORTOUT defines the output data set.  If  DISP=NEW,  DCB
            parameters  need  not  be  specified.  SyncSort will
            assign to SORTOUT the same DCB parameters  it  found
            for  SORTIN.   SyncSort provides automatic secondary
            allocation for disk data sets.  It provides up to 16
            total extents of whatever type of space you assigned
            to SORTOUT primary.
1
    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          4-17





        SORTWKnn defines the intermediate storage data sets.  Up
            to 32 data sets can be specified by filling  in  the
            nn  with  01  to  32.   A  valid  unit  name must be
            substituted for 'unit1' including a tape unit.   The
            space  parameter  is  only  required for disk units.
            You must substitute space2 with an appropriate space
            specification.

        b.  Sorting Large Input Data sets.  When you have  large
    amounts  of data to sort, it is recommended that you use the
    MAXSORT feature of SyncSort.

        c.  Merging Data sets.  To  merge  data  sets  that  are
    already  in sequence, you must use the SORTINxx DD statement
    for each input data set, substituting a number from 01 to 32
    for the xx.  The data sets must have the same record  format
    and record length for fixed length records.

        d.  Additional DD statements,  parameters,  and  control
    statements  are  fully  described  in the SyncSort Reference
    Manual.

    4-10.  2ISG  NEWS is a data set that  contains  computerized
    news  items  of general interest to 2ISG  clients on the MVS
    system.  The data set is in PDS format and is  available  to
    browse  or  print at the client's site.  The data set can be
    browsed with TSO  or  printed  through  a  batch  job.   TSO
    commands  and  a  JCL  procedure  are available to print the
    entire data set.

           1. TSO access
              (a) Use ISPF to Browse the data set.
              (b) Use the TSO CLIST command as follows:

                  NEWS   or  %NEWS

              (c) Use the TSO PRINTOFF command to print the data
                  set at your remote printer:

                PRINTOFF 'SYS1.SADSC.NEWS' NOHEADING DEST(RMTXX)

                  Where RMTXX is your remote printer name or VPS
                  printer name.

           2. JCL procedure for users who prefer to print the
              data set via batch.

          //PRINT   EXEC PDSPRINT,PDS='SYS1.SADSC.NEWS'

    4-11.  EASY PROCLIB.  This software allows a user to have  a
    private  JCL  procedure  library  without pre-defining it to
    JES2.   The  library  may  contain  JCL  procedures,  source
    programs, control statements, etc.  You  can  even  use  the
    same names used in the System Procedure Library.

        a.  EASY PROCLIB USER'S MANUAL.  You can obtain an  EASY
    PROCLIB  Users  Manual  by  either entering a TSO command or
    submitting a batch job.

            (1) TSO command.

                PRINTOFF 'SYS1.SADSC.NEWS(EASYMANL)'
                     ASA NOHEADING DEST(xxxx)

                xxxx is the RJE remote number ( i.e. RMT89 ) or
                the VPS printer name.

            (2) JCL for a batch job.

          //jobname JOB (accounting-field),name-field,parameters
          /*ROUTE  PRINT RMTnn
          //PRINT  EXEC NEWS
          //SYSIN  DD 1
            PRINT MEMBER=(EASYMANL)
          /*



        b.  HOW TO USE EASY PROCLIB.  To use  EASY  PROCLIB  you
    must  allocate  a  partitioned  data  set  (PDS) on a direct
    access storage volume which is permanently mounted  at  2ISG
    and  use a PROCLIB DD statement on your jobs to identify the
    PDS.

        c.  Allocating the PDS.

            (1) The block size of user proclib data sets can not
    be larger than the block size of the data set identified  by
    the  PROC  DD statement (usually this is SYS1.PROCLIB) which
    has been established as BLKSIZE=6160.

1
    2ISGM  171-3  1 September 1985                          4-19





            (2) The logical record length (LRECL)  of  the  user
    proclib  data  set must be the same as the LRECL of the data
    set  identified  by  the  PROC  DD  statement.   2ISG    has
    established  this to be LRECL=80.  The block size must be an
    integral multiple of the logical record length.

         d.  Coding the PROCLIB DD statement.

            (1) PROCLIB is the only valid  character  string  in
    the  name field of the DD statement and must be on the first
    DD statement for the user proclib data set(s).  If more than
    one data set is specified, the subsequent DD field names  of
    the DD statements must be blank.

            (2) All VS rules of syntax  apply  to  keywords  and
    keyword  operands  coded on PROCLIB DD statements.  However,
    further restrictions  apply  to  PROCLIB  DD  statements  as
    follows:

                (a)  The DSN= keyword.
                   . The entry DSN=NULLFILE is invalid

                (b)  The DISP= keyword.
                   . The first operand must be either OLD or SHR
                   . The second  operand  must  be  KEEP  or  be
                     omitted
                   . The  third  operand  must  be  KEEP  or  be
                     omitted
                   . Any  other  combination  of   operands   is
                     invalid.

                (c)  The VOL= keyword.
                   . The first  positional  parameter  (PRIVATE)
                     must be omitted.
                   . The second  positional  parameter  (RETAIN)
                     must be omitted.
                   . The  third  positional  parameter   (volume
                     count  field)  may  be  coded, but if it is
                     coded, it must be four characters  or  less
                     in  length, and must contain the value 0 or
                     the value 1.  Any other value is invalid.
                   . The  fourth  positional  parameter  (volume
                     sequence field) may be coded, but if it  is
                     coded,  it must be three characters or less
                     in length, and must contain the value 0  or
                     the value 1.  Any other value is invalid.
1
    4-20                           2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985





                (d) The SER= minor keyword of the VOL=  keyword.
    Only  1 operand is allowed, and must be 1 to 6 characters in
    length.  Any other operand is invalid.

                (e) The REF= minor keyword of the VOL=  keyword.
    Only  1  operand is allowed, and it must be a valid data set
    name of a  data  set  which  is  catalogued  in  the  system
    catalog.  Any other operand is invalid.

            (3) No referbacks are allowed in any of  the  fields
    of a PROCLIB DD statement.

            (4) Other keywords than those discussed above may be
    coded.  They will be checked for correctness of syntax,  but
    otherwise ignored, with the following exceptions:
            . DD DYNAM is invalid.
            . DD DUMMY is invalid.
            . The TERM= keyword is invalid.

        e.  Using the PROCLIB DD Statement:

            (1) Place the PROCLIB DD  statement  after  the  JOB
    statement  but  before  the  first  EXEC  statement.  If the
    PROCLIB  DD  statement  is  placed  after  the  first   EXEC
    statement,  it is treated as any other DD statement would be
    treated.

            (2) If the user proclib data set is catalogued, only
    the DSN= keyword and operand must appear on the  PROCLIB  DD
    statement.   Other  keywords  may be coded, but they must be
    syntactically correct.  Also, if the VOL= keyword is  coded,
    it  will  be  assumed  that the user proclib data set is not
    catalogued.

            (3) If the user proclib data set is  not  catalogued
    the  DSN=  and  the VOL= keywords and their operands must be
    coded.  In addition, either:

          . The SER= minor keyword may be used to supply a valid
            volume serial number  of  a  direct  access  storage
            volume, or
          . The REF= minor keyword  may  be  used  to  supply  a
            catalogued data set name, which in turn will be used
            by  the  LOCATE SVC to find the volume serial number
            of the residence volume of  the  user  proclib  data
            set.

    4-12.  VTAM PRINTER SUPPORT SYSTEM (VPS)

        a.  VTAM Printer Support System (VPS) supports IBM 3262,
    3287, 3288, 3289,  5210, 3767  and 7436 type printers or
    brand-X equivalents (non-IBM).

        b.  VPS provides the capability to print JES2  printouts
    on  any  of the above-mentioned printers while attached to a
    327X-type cluster.  In addition, using  the  TSO  'printoff'
    command,  one  can  print  out regular TSO data sets via the
    JES2 - VPS combination.   Console  support  to  control  all
    print  functions  provided by individual 327X-type terminals
    via TSO.  However, cost codes must be  defined  to  VPS  for
    authorization.


         c. VPS OPTIONS.

          1.  Printer related parameters:

        Sysout selection codes, i.e., classes - "A" or "C" or
        "X"

            A - Standard IBM SYSOUT default

            C - For special forms

            X - For TSO held output

           2.  TSO ID and printer authorization - Full TSO user
    IDs  may be used  as  authorization to access VPS and use a
    specified printer (or printers).  However, a prefix of a
    cost code, TSO, or Wylbur
    User ID may enable access by many users.

        Example:  'NYC000l ' - To specify a  full  User  ID will
                               limit access only to this user.

                      'NYC ' - To specify a prefix of a user ID
                               will enable any TSO ID that
                               begins with NYC to access your
                               specified printer(s).

    NOTE: A  prefix of the cost code for your  organization
          will be used,  unless   you  wish   to   limit  access
          (to VPS) to specific TSO IDs.  All TSO User IDs in
          your cost code  will have  access  to your printer(s),
          unless you wish to  limit access to specific TSO ID or
          group of IDs.

                    MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES

    5-1.  Problem Detection and Reporting.   2ISG   maintains  a
    Customer  Services   Division   to  help  users  solve  most
    operational  type  of  problems  that  occur.   The Customer
    Services  Division  can be called during weekdays from  0400
    to  2000 CT.  To help you solve your problems as efficiently
    as possible, you should have some  basic  information  about
    the   equipment,   the   software   and  the  communications
    facilities that you use and provide this information to  the
    customer   service   personnel.   The  nature  and  specific
    information about the  problem  will  also  be  required  to
    determine  the  cause.   Some  of the basic information that
    users need to know and communicate to 2ISG are :

          .  the terminal type, model and serial number, etc.
          .  the userid
          .  the system being used. There are several: IBM MVS
             system, IBM VM system and Burroughs system.
          .  Characteristics of your communication facility:
             leased line, dial-up, PDN, line speed(300bps,
             1200bps etc).
          .  The method of access:  TSO, Wylbur, RJE, etc.
          .  The software product: SAS, COBOL, a user
             application, etc.
          .  The problem itself.

    Some users use all the systems, some with the  same  userid,
    and therefore it's important to know the specific facilities
    being used.

        a.  Equipment Problems.

            (1)  Equipment  Maintenance.   All  2ISG    provided
    equipment is serviced by the respective vendor.  2ISG  keeps
    control of all maintenance and is the only one authorized to
    call for maintenance and repair service.  If your  equipment
    malfunctions,  you must first communicate the problem to the
    2ISG   Customer  Services  Division  and  they will make the
    appropriate calls to the vendor.

            (2) Location Changes.  Your  2ISG   account  manager
    should  be  notified  of all equipment location changes that
    you require.  You  can  avoid  a  lot  of  problems  if  you
    communicate  your  requirements  ahead  of time.  Some users
    have changed the location of terminals, and have  found  out
    that it doesn't work after that.

    5-2                            2ISGM  171-3   1 September 1985



            (3) 3270 Terminals.  All 327X users are expected  to
    fill  the  IBM  327X  Problem  Report  Form  when you have a
    problem.  These forms come with the terminal and consist  of
    simple  checklists  that  can  help you locate and solve the
    problem (with the  help  of  a  327X  manual).   This  basic
    documentation  will  also  be  necessary  to communicate the
    information required by the Customer Services Division.


        b.  Data Communications Problems.

        (1) Public Data Network (PDN).
        (2) Dial Up Service.
        (3) Leased Line Service.


        c.  Software Problems.  Once in  a  while  we  encounter
    software  problems  that  can  only  be  solved  by thorough
    investigation of all  information  concerning  the  problem.
    Documentation   and   data  are  essential  to  solve  these
    problems.  Since the user is the one closest to the problem,
    they must provide this information in the form of dumps  and
    listings.   Investigation  and  remedy can take some time to
    obtain (in  some  cases  the  problem  must  be  solved  and
    corrected by the vendor).

        d.  JCL Problems.  JCL problems are very frequent to the
    MVS user.  We can help you solve a particular problem if the
    JCL and all related data sets are accessible.  2ISG   cannot
    write  JCL  for  users;  it  can  only  help  them solve the
    problems that they may have as a result of the JCL that  the
    user has written.

                            PRINT OUTPUT


    SYSOUT=A
        Printed  on  11" X 14 7/8" lined paper with a default
        UCS of PN and an
        FCB of FCB26 at 6 lines/inch.  When  'LINES='  parameter
        specifies  greater  than  10,000  lines,  output will be
        printed on a time available basis.

    SYSOUT=C
        Printed on special forms available at 2ISG. Any  special
        forms print requirement needs prior coordination with
        account representatives. Special forms that are currently
        available are as follows:

        2PRT - 2 part carboned 11" X 14 7/8" paper.

        3PRT - 3 part carboned 11" X 14 7/8" paper.

        4PRT - 4 part carboned 11" X 14 7/8" paper.

        5PRT - 5 part carboned 11" X 14 7/8" paper.

        6PRT - 6 part carboned 11" X 14 7/8" paper.

    SYSOUT=U
        Use SYSOUT class=U if your desire your output to be
        printed on the Xerox 8700 page printer. The Xerox
        8700 can perform the same functions as the normal
        IBM 3203-5 printers except the output is printed on
        8 1/2 X 11 sheets of paper. Special form requests
        amy be made with JECL /*JOBPARM, /*OUTPUT, or on
        the JCL SYSOUT statement. These Xerox 8700 forms
        are as follows:

        XF01 - Simplex landscape print orientation with line
               every four spaces.

        XD01 - duplex  landscape print orientation with line
               every four spaces.

        Xd02 - '2-UP' (2 logical pages per physcial page)
               rotated 90 degress duplexed.

        XF03 - Simplex landscape print with alternating
               blank and shaded areas.

        XD03 - duplex  landscape print with alternating
               blank and shaded areas.

        XF04 - Simplex portrait with proportionately spaced
               lettering.

        XD04 - duplex  portrait with proportionately spaced
               lettering.

        XF08 - Simplex landscape form without lines or shading.

        XD08 - Duplex landscape form without lines or shading.

        XDDA - Duplex letter form.


        note:  As new special forms are developed for the Xerox
               8700, they will be advertised in bulletins.

     DISK DEVICES.

     DISK     CHAR/TRK   TRKS/CYL    CYL/DISK    CAPACITY(MB)
     -----    --------   --------    --------    -----------
     3330      13,030      19          404         100

        a.  Allocations made by TSO users with the TSO  allocate
    command  are directly controlled by program control facility
    (PCF) and is transparent to the user.   Therefore  only  the
    batch  jobs  that allocate disk space need a specific volume
    serial number on the JCL.

        b.  Track Size.  IBM's  maximum  block  size  is  32,760
    bytes,  but  the  track size of a 3380 disk is 47,476 bytes.
    Thus users who specify disk data sets in 1 track  increments
    or  less  will  see a significant increase in their bill for
    disk  space.   Remember that very  small data  sets are  not
    economical on 3380s.

        c.  With the exceptionally  large  track  capacity,  the
    blocking   factor   for   data   sets   is   another   major
    consideration.  Extremely small blocking factors waste space
    due  to  the inter-record gaps between blocks of data (quite
    large in comparison to the block).   Very  large  blocksizes
    are  very  efficient  in  disk  utilization but require more
    memory in the processing program because  all  programs  (by
    default)  store  5  blocks  into memory to read or write the
    data set.  Thus the question always asked is, what is a good
    blocksize for my data set on disk?  The following  are  very
    general guidelines for blocksizes.

     MVS JOB CLASS STRUCTURE.

     1.  2ISG  has implemented the following MVS JOB CLASS
     structure to increase throughput of batch processing.

                                 Max
            JOB     Max       Removeable    Num
           CLASS  CPU Time       Disk      Tapes
           -----  --------    ----------   -----
             Q        1           0          0
             A       10           0          0
             B       20           1          1
             C       30           1          2
             D       45           2          2
             E       60           2          2
             F       90           2          3
             O        1           1          1
             V        1           1          1

     2.  the explanation for each JOB CLASS is as follows:

    a. CLASS=Q  -  This  is  2ISG's   express  CLASS.   Any  JOB
        submitted in this CLASS will be in execution  within  15
        minutes.   Any  JOB  in CLASS=Q will require less than 1
        minute of CPUtime, no tape  mounts,  and  no  removeable
        disk  mounts.  Q CLASS is for quick compiles of programs
        and JOBs that require no operator intervention.

    b. CLASS=A - This CLASS is for JOBs taking longer than 1 CPU
        minute but less than 10 CPU minutes.  These JOBs require
        no tape drives or removeable disk allocations.  The JOBs
        should be in execution in 30 - 45 minutes.

    c. CLASS=B - This CLASS  will  have  a  maximum  of  20  CPU
        minutes,  no more than 1 tape mounted at any given time,
        and no more than 1 removeable disk pack mounted  at  any
        given time.  Since operator intervention is required for
        this  JOB,  2ISG  can  not   guarantee that JOBs in this
        CLASS will be in execution  as  quickly  as  CLASS=Q  or
        CLASS=A  JOBs.   However,  JOBs  in this CLASS should be
        into execution in less than 1  hour  from  the  time  of
        submission.

    d. CLASS=C - This CLASS will have a maximum  cputime  of  30
        minutes,  no  more  than two tapes mounted in the JOB at
        one time, and no  more  than  1  removeable  disk  drive
        allocated  at  one  time.   2ISG  will attempt to insure
        JOBs in this CLASS are into  execution  within  2  hours
        after submission.

    A2-8            2ISGM  171-3  Attachment 2  1 September 1985





    e. CLASS=D - This CLASS will have a maximum  CPUtime  of  45
        minutes,  no  more  than  2 tape drives allocated at one
        time,  and  no  more  than  2  removeable  disk   drives
        allocated  at one time.  The requirements for this CLASS
        are so large 2ISG  can not guarantee a JOB in this CLASS
        will be in execution  during  prime  time.   2ISG   will
        strive to keep one JOB of this CLASS active at all times
        when there are no JOBs in classes Q or A.

    f. CLASS=E - This CLASS will have a maximum  cputime  of  60
        minutes,  no  more  than  2 tape drives allocated at one
        time, and no more than 2 removeable disks  allocated  at
        one  time.  the requirements for this CLASS are so large
        2ISG  can not guarantee a JOB in this CLASS will  be  in
        execution  during prime time.  2ISG  will strive to keep
        one JOB of this CLASS active at all times when there are
        no JOBs in CLASSes q, a, or b.

    g. CLASS=F - This CLASS is for the single threading of JOBs.
        The maximum CPUtime for this CLASS is  90  minutes,  the
        maximum  number  of tape drives allocated at one time is
        3, and the maximum  number  of  removeable  disk  drives
        required  is  2.   An  alternative  to using CLASS=F for
        single-threading JOBs is to submit all  JOBs  using  the
        same  jobname.   Thus,  if  you have many JOBs to be run
        serially,   giving   them   the   same   jobname   under
        CLASS=Q,A,B,or C should provide faster  turnaround  than
        using CLASS=F.

    h. CLASS=O - This is for the overnite queue.  It is also the
        CLASS assigned to JOBs which are  missing  the  "CLASS="
        keyword  parameter on the JOB statement.  JOBs submitted
        in this CLASS are automatically held by the  system  for
        processing  at  night,  usually  because they have large
        resource requirements which  cannot  be  handled  during
        prime  time.   It's  a  good  idea  to  place  any  JOBs
        requiring  large amounts of resources (i.e., CLASS=D, E,
        or F) in CLASS=O for  overnite  processing  because
        their is usually a discount given for the cost of these
        jobs.

    i. CLASS=V - This is for the very-cheap queue. Jobs that do
        do require overnite turnaround, can be run very cheaply
        in 2ISG's very-cheap hours. This class will receive a
        very large discount for the jobs run in it. Very-cheap
        hours are usually very late at night or early in the
        morning, including all weekend days and holidays.

       note: Since the job classes used are changed to fit the
             current, check to see if there are any bulletins
             superceding this class structure.

    3.  The following examples show the requirements and the JOB
    CLASS selected.
     REQUIREMENTS                         CLASS SELECTED
     ------------------------------       ---------------
    a. JOB  1 requires 2 CPU minutes            A
       max, no tape or disk mounts.

    b. JOB  2 requires 1 CPU minute             Q
       max, no tape or disk mounts.

    c. JOB  3 requires less than 1              B
       minute of CPUtime, no tape
       mounts, and 1 removeable disk
       mount.

    d. JOB  4 requires 5 CPU minutes            B
       max, 1 tape drive allocation max,
       and no removeable disk mounts.

    e. JOB  5 requires 1 CPU minute max,        C
       2 tape drives max, and no
       removeable disk mounts.


    f. JOB  6 requires 65 CPU minutes,          F
       no removeable disk, and no tapes.

    g. JOB  7 requires 1 minute CPUtime         D
       max, no tape drives, and 2
       removeable disk mounts.

    h. JOB  8 requires 3 CPU minutes            O
      max, 5 tape drives, and no
      removeable disk.  (The
      requirements for this JOB use
      almost all the available tape
      drives and therefore should be
      scheduled overnite.)

    4.  JOBs submitted with an invalid CLASS will be placed into
    CLASS=O and processed overnite.  JOBs in CLASS=O can not  be
    placed  into  execution  during prime time(0600 ct-1800 ct),
    because the resource requirements are so large.

    5.  There is no automated  mechanism  installed  to  prevent
    abuse  of  the  CLASS  structure.   Enforcement of the CLASS
    structure is a 2ISG  operator responsibility.   Though  some
    violations  of a JOB CLASS may not be discovered, violations
    which are discovered will result in the cancellation of  the
    JOB  (i.e.,  a  CLASS=Q  or CLASS=A JOB asking for a tape or
    removeable disk will be cancelled).

                      SYSOUT CLASSES

    Note that these classes are not the same as JOB classes.

    SYSOUT class A:

    Standard print output with less than 10,000  lines.   Prints
    on   white   paper  with  lines,   either  14" x 8 1/2"   or
    11 x 14 7/8". The /*OUTPUT statements may  be  used. Special
    forms should not be specified.

    Note:  If your job will generate more than 10,000 lines, you
    must indicate this on  your /*JOBPARM  statement;  otherwise
    your job will ABEND.

    SYSOUT Class B:

    Standard punch output with less than 2,000  cards.   Punches
    on  stock  80 column statements.  /*OUTPUT statements may be
    used.  Special forms should not be specified.

    SYSOUT Class C:

    Special  print  output.  Requires  special paper, or special
    operator processing. The form ID in the SYSOUT parameter
    specifies either valid paper stock form or  refers
    this DD statement to an associated /*OUTPUT statement.

    SYSOUT Class D:

    Special punch output.  Requires special statements,  or
    special operator  processing.
    /*OUTPUT statements may be used.

    SYSOUT Class U:

    Special print output destined for the Xerox 8700 online
    page printer.

    SYSOUT Class E-T, W-Z, 0-9

    Dummy print SYSOUT class.

    SYSOUT Class *:

    Specifying a  SYSOUT  class  of  *  on  a  SYSOUT  parameter
    requests  that  the message SYSOUT class be used for this DD
    statement.   For  example,  if  a  job  statement  specifies
    MSGCLASS=C and a DD statement specifies  SYSOUT=  (*,,0801),
    this would be the same as SYSOUT=(C,,0801).

    NOTE:  All other SYSOUT classes are invalid.  Invalid SYSOUT
    classes are converted to SYSOUT=Z automatically.

      (see note)                 (1-6)


    NOTES.
        (1) Priority Class (PRTY).  The priority class indicates
    the scheduling priority for a job.  The allowable values are
    1 through 2.  If a value greater than the maximum  is  coded
    on  the parameter, the system lowers it automatically to the
    maximum value permitted.  After the  job  starts  execution,
    the  priority  is  meaningless; all jobs execute at the same
    priority.  Generally,  TSO  sessions  always  execute  at  a
    higher  priority than batch jobs.  However, the TSO priority
    is lowered as it becomes CPU bound until it reaches a  point
    that  is  equal  to  the short duration batch job.  For this
    reason, batch is always recommended  for  long  running  CPU
    bound programs.

                        PROGRAM ACCESS (PA)
                                AND
                     PROGRAM FUNCTION (PF) KEYS

    Program Access (PA) and Program Function (PF) keys are  used
    to  request frequently used or special ISPF operations.  The
    most common use is set up as follows.

    PA1  TSO Attention.  This key is logically disabled by  ISPF
        whenever   the   keyboard  is  unlocked,  except  during
        execution  of  a TSO  command  under  ISPF   (foreground
        processing option or TSO command option.)

    PA2  RESHOW SCREEN.  Redisplays the contents of  the  screen
        in  the event that the user has accidentally pressed the
        ERASE or CLEAR key, or entered unwanted information.

    PF1  HELP.  Calls up additional information about  an  error
        message  or  general information about ISPF commands and
        options.

    PF2  SPLIT SCREEN.  Causes entry into the split screen  mode
        or a change in location of the split.

    PF3  END.  Terminates the current  operation  and  causes  a
        return to the previous menu.

    PF4  PRINT SCREEN.  Causes a "snapshot" of the screen  image
        to be recorded in USERID.SPFn.LIST. This data set may be
        saved or printed at ISPF termination.

    PF5  REPEAT Repeats the action of the previous FIND  command
        (applies to browse and edit only).

    PF6  REPEAT CHANGE.  Repeats  the  action  of  the  previous
        CHANGE command (applies to EDIT only).

    PF7  SCROLL UP.  Causes scrolling up by the number of  lines
        shown in the scroll amount field.

    PF8  SCROLL DOWN.  Causes scrolling down by  the  number  of
        lines shown in the scroll amount field.

    PF9  SWAP SCREENS.  Moves the  cursor  to  wherever  it  was
        previously   positioned  on  the  other  logical  screen
        (applies  to  split  screen  mode  only).

                        PROGRAM ACCESS (PA)
                                AND
                     PROGRAM FUNCTION (PF) KEYS

    PF10 SCROLL LEFT.  Cause scrolling left  by  the  number  of
        columns shown in the scroll amount field.

    PF11 SCROLL RIGHT.  Causes scrolling right by the number  of
        columns shown in the scroll amount field.

    PF12 MOVE CURSOR TO INPUT FIELD.  Moves the  cursor  to  the
        first  input  field  on  line  2  (normally,  the option
        selection or command input field).  Pressing this PF key
        again causes the cursor to be moved to the second  input
        field on line 2 (normally the scroll amount field).
