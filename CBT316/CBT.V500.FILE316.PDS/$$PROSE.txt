                     -----------------------------------
                   THIS IS A COLLECTION OF BATCH UTILTITY PGMS. MY
                   INTENT IS TO PUT TOGETHER A FILE OF THESE PGMS FOR
                   SHARE. SOME ARE ORIGINAL AND MOST WERE OBTAINED FROM
                   OUR OS/MVT DAYS AND CONVERTED. IT IS EMBARRASSING TO
                   TELL MANAGEMENT THAT USERS HAVE LOST FUNCTION MIGRAT-
                   ING TO MVS AND ALL OF ITS WONDERS. HOPEFULLY I CAN
                   DONATE SOME OF THESE HANDY UTILITIES TO OTHERS WHO
                   WERE NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE AN IBM 360 WITH OS/MVT
                   ALOT WAS DEVELOPED FOR OS/MVT AND MUCH OF IT IS STILL
                   APPLICABLE.

           10 OCT 86 - AS I CHECK OUT THE DIFFERENT PGMS ON AN MVS/XA
                       SYSTEM I WILL NOTE IT IN THE REL FIELD. MY
                       SCHEME OF THINGS IS AS FOLLOWS:
                       X     - CHECKED OUT ON MVS/XA
                       Y     - RUNS ONLY MVS/SP AND I WILL NOT PURSUE
                               THE CHANGES TO MVS/XA, YOU CAN DO IT
                               AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THE CODE IF SO.
                               (MAY WORK IN MVS/SP, YOU CAN TRY).
                       N     - ONLY RUNS IN MVS/SP, NEEDS CONVERSION
                       Z     - RUNS NOW IN MVS/XA BUT WAS CONVERTED
                               AND IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK IN MVS/SP
                               YOU NEED TO LOOK IN CODE AND CHANGE A
                               CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY.

          SUMMARY OF THE MODULES CONTAINED.

          UTIL     REL          DESCRIPTION

          $$MACROX  4    INCORPORATED BILL GODFREY'S MODS TO
                         'IFOX00' TO PRODUCE MACRO CROSS REFERENCE.
                         PDS WAS  MADE INTO A MEMBER PRECEDED WITH
                         '>< ADD NAME=   ' CARDS AND SPF STATS. THIS
                         WAS IN A SEPARATE FILE ON THE MODS TAPES.

          ASKOPER   1    PASS OPERATOR A QUESTION IN A PARM AND TWO
                         REPLIES; ONE GIVES RC=0 AND SECOND  RC=4

          ASMBOX1   1    PUT A NICE LOOKING BOX AROUND YOUR ASSEMBLY
                         LISTING OUTPUT. LINECT FOR ASSEMBLY
                         LISTING IS 53. CODE IS 3800 DEPENDENT.

          ASMHNOX   1    A PTF FOR AN ASSEMBLER H BUG.
                         AS YOU KNOW ASM H IS CLASS C NOW.

          ASMR90    1    ROTATE 90 DEGREES ASSEMBLY LISTINGS
                         ON THE 3800 TYPE PRINTERS.

          BLOKHD    1X   GODDARD SPACE FLT CENTER UTILITY TO PRODUCE
                         12X12 BLOCK LETTERS UP TO 8 ACROSS THE PAGE
                         AND FOUR BLOCK LINES PER PAGE.

          BLOKHF    1X   FORTRAN INTERFACE MODULE SO YOU CAN CALL
                         'BLOKHD' FROM FORTRAN CODE.

          BLOKLTR   1X   FORTRAN PGM THAT PRODUCES BLOCK LETTERS ONE
                         PER PAGE (SIDEWAYS).

          BLOKPDS   1X   TAKES A SEQUENTIAL SOURCE FILE CREATED BY
                         UTIL 'LISTPDS' AND CREATES A PRINT FILE
                         WITH 12X12 BLOCK LETTERS BEFORE EACH MEMBER
                         IN THE LISTING. GREAT FOR PUTTING SOURCE
                         ON MICROFICHE. SEE DOC IN CODE.

          CATLIST   1    THIS PROGRAM IS FROM MIKE LOOS, DELUXE CHK
                         PRINTERS. THIS WILL DO A VERY FAST LIST OF
                         AN ICF CATALOG FOR GDG'S AND NONVSAM DSNS.
                         LISTING IS IN THE SAME FORMAY AS IDCAMS
                         (WE USED IT TO BUILD A TMC) BUT THE OUTPUT
                         FORMAT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO CHANGE. SEE
                         COMMEMTS IN THE CODE FOR AN EXPLANATION
                         OF ITS SPEED AND RELATION TO RACF.

          COPYFILE  4X   POWERFUL COPY TAPE TYPE PROGRAM. IF YOU
                         HAVE MULTIFILE SL TAPES WILL COPY SELECTED
                         FILES VIA A CONTROL CARD.

          COPYREC   5X   PROVIDE FOR A SELECTIVE COPY OF RECORDS VIA
                         A CONTROL CARD FOR ANY LRECL FILE;  LIKE
                         1-100, 450-800, 900-950.

          CT        3X   AIR FORCE DEVELOPED HIGH SPEED TAPECOPY
                         PROGRAM. RUNS AT EXCP SPEED. COPIES LABELED
                         OR UNLABLED, SINGLE OR MULTIFLE, AND IF ONE
                         REEL ONLY, AN OPTION TO VERIFY BYTE FOR
                         BYTE. COPIES MULTIVOLUME OR MULTIFILE AND
                         MULTIVOLUME WITH NO VERIFY FUNCTION.

          C3PO      1Y   BRIAN SCOTT OF NOW TEXACO, WROTE C3PO TO
                         BE THE SRB RECEIVER FOR R2D2. R2D2 NEEDS A
                         A TASK OF SOME KIND GOING TO BUMP THE SRB
                         OFF OF. MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING #CMD
                         SUBSYSTEM AND SOME OTHER BRAVE SOLES, JES2.
                         PLUS NOW C3PO WILL TALK TO YOU IF YOU WANT.
                         WANT TO INCREASE ITS VOCABULARY, YOU ARE
                         WELCOME.    HAVE NOT INSTALLED IT THIS WAY
                         BUT WILL WHEN I GO TO MVS/SP1.3.

          C3PO2     1Y   SAME AS ABOVE, BUT WITH A STIMER IN IT FOR
                         PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WNAT TO RUN C3PO WITH
                         TIME=1440.

          DELINK0   2    SOURCE CARDS FOR IBM FE PROGRAM TO 'DELINK'
                         WE RECONSTRUCTED THE SOURCE IMAGES WITH A
                         DISASSEMBLER AND ALOT OF PATIENCE.  FUN !!!

          DISKMAP   3Y   DISKMAP PROGRAM HAS 3330 SUPPORT, 3350, AND
                         3850 SUPPORT INCLUDED. GIVES SIMILIAR INFO
                         TO A COMPAKTOR MAP. THIS DOES NOT UPDATE
                         LASTUSE DATE  FOR EVERY FILE ON THE PACK;
                         NOT REALLY TRUE FOR PDS'S, SO STILL BEWARE.

          DOWEGO    2X   PGM TO PUT OUT QUESTION TO OPERATOR OF 'GO'
                         OR 'NOGO'. 'NOGO' IMPLIES ABEND, 'GO' = RC0

          EALSD095  1X   EASTERN AIRLINES UPDATE OF THE STANDARD IBM
                         BLOCK LETTER ROUTINE IEFSD095; WAS USED
                         FOR BANNER PAGES. THE UPDATED VERSION HAS
                         ALL THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS INCLUDED IN IT.

          EXIMPORT  1    THIS PROGRAM IS FROM MIKE LOOS, DELUXE CHK
                         PRINTERS. WILL CREATE 2 JCL FILES, A CLIST,
                         AND A SYSPRINT LISTING. THE JCL FILES HAVE
                         A SET OF EXPORT AND IMPORT JCL DESIGNED TO
                         EXPORT (VSAM) AND IEBGENER (DSORG=PS) ALL
                         DATASETS ON A VOLUME TO TAPE AND RESTORE
                         WITH IMPORT (VSAM) AND IEBGENER (DSORG=PS)
                         FROM TAPE TO DISK. THE VSAM PORTION WORKS
                         ONLY FOR UNIQUE DATASETS (DFEF) AND BASE
                         CLUSTERS ONLY. SEE THE CODE FOR FURTHER
                         EXPLANATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS.

          EXIT002   1Y   JES2/SP1.3 EXIT 2. TAKES TIME OFF THE

                         JOB CLASS FROM AFDSC.

          EXIT006   1Y   JES2/SP1.3 EXIT 6. PUT TIME BACK ON JOBCARD
                         FOR THE APPROPRIATE JOB CLASS. ALSO SEE

                         MODULE & MAKE A ZAP FROM IT. PGM DOES NOT
                         CHANGE LOAD MODULE BUT GENERATES 'AMASPZAP'
                         CONTROL CARDS.
