  * NOTE:  Control cards for the COPYSLNL and COPYNLNL programs
           are identical to those for the COPYFILE program.  The
           help for these control cards is included here.  Control
           card handling is now done by the called program SELCARDS,
           whose source code is included in the source code for all
           three programs.  Assembly of the source code must be
           done with PARM=BATCH in effect, for the assembler step.

    >>>    COPYNLNL has now been modified so that the restriction
    >>>    that input file numbers be in ASCENDING order does not
    >>>    apply anymore.  You can code 7/3  2  50  3  51 -100 now
    >>>    for a COPYNLNL run.

           COPYNLNL copies files from an INPUT NL tape to an
           OUTPUT NL tape, with the ability to select which files
           are to be copied.  COPYNLNL stops when it sees two
           consecutive tape marks on the input tape.

           COPYFILE (on CBT Tape File 229) does the same thing for
           SL to SL tapes.  COPYNLNL stops after two consecutive
           tape marks on the input tape.  COPYFILE and COPYSLNL,
           being written for SL input tapes, are considerably
           "smarter".

          RELEASE     07 SEP  2003


   FUNCTION:  COPY SELECTED FILES FROM A MULTIPLE-FILE INPUT TAPE
              TO A MULTIPLE FILE OUTPUT TAPE.

   EXEC PARAMETER:  IF PARM=TAPEL IS SPECIFIED ON THE EXEC CARD,
              A 'TAPEL' LISTING OF THE OUTPUT TAPE AFTER THE
              COPY OPERATION WILL BE PROVIDED.  (This does not
              apply to the COPYNLNL program, which assumes NL
              tapes for input and output.)

   PROCEDURE:

        //COPYNLNL PROC FROM=,TO=,DSP=KEEP
        //COPYSTEP EXEC PGM=COPYNLNL,REGION=2000K,PARM=' -OPTIONAL- '

   CONTROL CARDS:

              THE COPYNLNL PROGRAM IS CONTROLLED BY SYSIN CARDS.
              ONE OR MORE CARDS MAY BE USED.  72 CARD COLUMNS ARE
              SCANNED.  THE CARDS CONTAIN THE NUMBERS OF THE FILES
              OF THE INPUT TAPE WHICH ARE TO BE COPIED TO THE
              OUTPUT TAPE.  THESE NUMBERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED
              TO BE IN ASCENDING ORDER.  IF THE FILES ARE TO BE
              COPIED TO AN EXISTING SET OF FILES ON THE OUTPUT
              TAPE, THE NUMBER OF THE FIRST NEW OUTPUT FILE IS
              ATTACHED TO THE NUMBER OF THE FIRST INPUT FILE WITH
              / . SEE THE EXAMPLES.

       >>>    It is now possible to write over the same output
       >>>    file twice.  If this happens, such as with cards:
       >>>       7/1  2  -30 31/27
       >>>    the process will work, but you will get a warning
       >>>    message in SYSPRINT, and the program gives a
       >>>    return code of 4, instead of a code of 0.

        New control card features:  (with the SELCARDS program)

              To copy a range of files, not to the end of the input
              tape, code the first file number in the range, followed
              by the last number in the range, preceded by a dash.

              For example, to copy files 51 to 100 from an input tape,
              code:   51 -100   with space(s) in between the two
              control numbers, as shown.  This will copy files 51,
              52, ...  and so forth, from the input tape, to
              consecutive files on the output tape, stopping after
              file 100 on the input tape.  Later files may be copied
              afterwards, for example:   51  -100 103   will copy
              files 51 thru 100 on the input tape, skip files 101
              and 102, and copy file 103.

   EXAMPLES:

              1. COPY FILES 3, 5, 6, 9 FROM TAPE 101003 TO A NEW
                 SCRATCH TAPE.

                 // EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=101003
                 //SYSIN    DD *
                  3 5 6 9
                 /*

              2. ADD THE SAME FILES TO TAPE 007177, WHICH ALREADY
                 HAS SEVEN FILES WHICH ARE TO BE PRESERVED.

                 //   EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=101003,TO=007177
                 //SYSIN  DD *
                   3/8  5  6  9
                 /*

              3. MERGE SELECTED FILES FROM THREE TAPES, AND PRODUCE
                 A TAPEL LISTING OF THE RESULT.

                 //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=123770,TO=100022,DSP=PASS
                 //SYSIN   DD *
                  1  2  52  53
                 /*
                 //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=101832,TO=100022,DSP=PASS
                 //SYSIN   DD *
                   7/5  7  12  13
                 /*
                 //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=111333,TO=100022,
                 //      PARM=TAPEL
                 //SYSIN   DD *
                   12/9
                 /*


     NOTES:      1. FILES MUST BE COPIED FROM THE INPUT TAPE IN THE
                    SAME ORDER IN WHICH THEY APPEAR, I.E. EACH INPUT
                    FILE NUMBER IS LARGER THAN THE ONE SPECIFIED IN
                    THE PRECEDING CONTROL CARD.

                 2. NORMALLY THE FIRST OUTPUT FILE NUMBER SPECIFIED
                    WOULD BE ONE GREATER THAN THE LAST EXISTING FILE
                    ON THE OUTPUT TAPE. IF IT IS LESS, AN EXISTING
                    FILE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN. IF IT IS MORE, THE
                    TAPE WILL RUN OFF ITS REEL BY THE PROGRAM
                    SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT STARTING POINT.

                 3. THE REGION REQUIRED IS 33K PLUS FIVE TIMES
                    ( MVT IS TWO TIMES ) THE LARGEST BLKSIZE OF
                    THE FILES COPIED. THE COPY TIME IS SUBSTANTIALLY
                    LESS THAN 1 MINUTE.

                 4. THE INPUT AND OUTPUT TAPES MUST HAVE STANDARD
                    LABELS.

                 5. DATASETS WITH ANY DCB PARAMETERS WILL BE COPIED
                    SUCCESSFULLY, EVEN IF THEY VARY FROM FILE TO FILE.
                    DCB PARAMETERS SHOULD NOT BE SPECIFIED AS AN
                    OVERRIDE TO THE PROCEDURE.


                 6. THE OUTPUT FILES SHOULD NOT BE CATALOGED VIA JCL.
                    EVEN THOUGH THE JOB CALLS FOR SL SCRATCH, IT APPEARS
                    THAT THE HEADER IS DESTROYED WHEN THE KEEP MSG
                    HAS L00100 ( EXAMPLE ) AS IF IT WAS A NL TAPE.
                    NEVER FEAR, THE OUTPUT LABEL IS INTACT.

               ADDENDUM TO THE COPYNLNL PROGRAM
               --------------------------------


    THE WORD 'ALL' MAY NOW BE USED ON CONTROL CARDS. IT CAUSES THE REST
  THE FILES ON THE INPUT TAPE TO BE COPIED TO THE OUTPUT TAPE.

    A DASH, FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A FILE NUMBER, HAS THE SAME EFFECT
  AS 'ALL', EXCEPT THAT THE MULTI-FILE COPY WILL STOP AT THE INPUT FILE
  NUMBER AFTER THE DASH.  FOR EXAMPLE, -35 WILL COPY THE FIRST 35 FILES
  OF A TAPE, AND WILL THEN STOP.  Other control statements may now be
  coded after a control statement with a dash.  To see the detailed
  action of the coded control statements, use the optional DD name of
  //SELREPT  DD  SYSOUT=*  .


   EXAMPLES:

   1. COPY ALL FILES FROM TAPE 100035 TO A NEW SCRATCH TAPE.

      //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=100035
      //SYSIN  DD *
        ALL
      /*

   2. COPY FILES 3, 5, AND 7 THROUGH THE END OF THE TAPE TO A NEW
      SCRATCH TAPE.

     //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=100035
      //SYSIN   DD *
       3  5  7  ALL
      /*

   2A. COPY FILES 3, 5, AND 7 THROUGH FILE 45 TO A NEW SCRATCH TAPE.

     //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=100035
      //SYSIN   DD *
       3  5  7  -45
      /*

   2B. COPY FILES 3, 5, AND 7 THROUGH FILE 45  and 50 THROUGH 100
       TO A NEW SCRATCH TAPE.

     //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=100035
      //SYSIN   DD *
       3  5  7  -45   50 -100
      /*

   3. ADD THE FILES FROM TAPE 100035 TO TAPE 100070 AFTER EXIST-
      ING FILE 8.

      //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=100035,TO=100070
      //SYSIN  DD *
       1/9  ALL
      /*

   3A. ADD THE FILES FROM TAPE 100035 TO TAPE 100070 AFTER EXIST-
      ING FILE 8, BUT ONLY THE FIRST 10 FILES.

      //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=100035,TO=100070
      //SYSIN  DD *
       1/9  -10
      /*

   4. ADD FILES 3 AND 5 THROUGH 12 ( THAT IS ALL THERE ARE ) FROM
      TAPE 100035 TO TAPE 100050 WHICH ALREADY CONTAINS THREE
      FILES WHICH ARE TO BE KEPT.

      //  EXEC COPYNLNL,FROM=100035,TO=100050
      //SYSIN    DD *
       3/4  5  ALL
      /*

 NOTE:  WITH THE LATEST EDITION OF COPYNLNL WHICH USES THE SELCARDS
        PROGRAM TO CHOOSE THE FILES TO BE COPIED, MORE THAN ONE DASH
        CAN BE CODED, TO COPY MORE THAN ONE RANGE OF FILE NUMBERS.
