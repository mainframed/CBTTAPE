                 RELEASE    1      24 JULY 1984


            THIS IS THE SOURCE FILE TO ASSEMBLE A PROGRAM CALLED
           'CATPTPCH'. I OBTAINED IT FROM THE OS/MVT PROJECT TAPE WHEN
           I WAS ON OS/MVT. IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO OFFLOAD YOUR OS
           CATALOGS IN IEHPROGM PROGRAM FORMAT CONTROL CARDS. IT DOES
           ALL THE BLDG'S ETC NECESSARY TO REBUILD THE CATALOG. TRUE
           THERE ARE NICE NEAT PROGRAMS TO DO COPIES OF CATALOGS ETC.
           BUT THERE IS JUST SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU A WARM FEELING
           IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR STOMACH WHEN YOU CAN SEE THE CATALOG
           REPRODUCED IN IEHPROGM CONTROL CARDS.

            WE HAVE ADDED THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR ALL 3330 DEVICES
            3350'S. IT HAS SOME OTHER
            FUNCTIONS THAT ARE EXPLAINED IN THE MEMBER $DOC. THE CODE
            IS IN THE FORM OF MACROS AND I HAVE PUT A MEMBER CALLED
            $INSTALL TO DEMONSTRATE THE JCL REQUIRED FOR AN ASSEMBLY.
            I WANT TO THANK DARRELL WILCOX OF KING COUNTY SYSTEMS FOR
            THE ORIGINAL CODE.  GOOD LUCK !!!!!

                        JIM MARSHALL, CAPT, USAFR-RET

            AS AN ADDED WORD HERE. I BELIEVE YOU WILL SEE THE SYSTEM
           ON THE MACRO FOR GENERATING THE CODE. WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY
           CODED I THINK 'SYSTEM=370' MEANT TO INCLUDE 370 INSTRUCTIONS.
           I TRIED THE CODE AND IT BLEW. SO I INTEND THE MEANING TO BE
           'SYSTEM=360' TO BE FOR OS/MVT ON 360'S AND 370'S. AND
           'SYSTEM=370' TO MEAN OS/MVS. I HAVE ONLY DONE THE FUNCTIONS
           TO PRINT THE CATALOG OFF OR PUNCH IT OFF. WILL PROBABLY
           CONTINUE TO PLAY WITH IT. IF YOU DISCOVER ANY BUGS, PLEASE
           SEND ME THE CORRECTIONS.

1 A. PURPOSE
+    _______
-    THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE A COMPLETE AND EFFICIENT MEANS OF
0    MAINTAINING AN O/S CATALOG DATA SET.  THE PROGRAM PROVIDES TWO FUNCTIONS TO
0    ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL; THEY MAY BE USED SEPARATELY OR JOINTLY.

-    THE FIRST FUNCTION IS TO PROVIDE A LISTING OF ALL ENTRIES IN A CATALOG,
0    INCLUDING UNUSED INDEXES (THE UTILITY IEHLIST DOES NOT SHOW UNUSED
0    INDEXES).  THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS IN THE CATALOG BEING USED, AND THE
0    NUMBER STILL AVAILABLE ARE ALSO PRINTED.

-    THE SECOND FUNCTION IS TO PRODUCE CONTROL CARDS FOR THE UTILITY IEHPROGM
0    WHICH CAN BE USED TO RECREATE OR REORGANIZE THE CATALOG.  THE CONTROL CARDS
0    CONTAIN A SEQUENCE NUMBER IN COLUMNS 73 - 80 AND THEY MUST BE SORTED INTO
0    ASCENDING SEQUENCE PRIOR TO USING.

-    BY REMOVING THE CARDS FOR UNWANTED ENTRIES, FULL CONTROL OVER THE CONTENTS
0    OF A CATALOG CAN BE RETAINED.
- B. ADVANTAGES
+    __________
-    THIS PROGRAM LISTS EVEN UNUSED INDEXES IN THE CATALOG, THUS ALLOWING THEM
0    TO BE REMOVED.  ALSO, ALL AVAILABLE CORE IS USED TO BUFFER CATALOG DATA
0    BLOCKS, THUS REDUCING THE I/O ACTIVITY INVERSELY WITH THE AMOUNT OF CORE.
0    (ONLY ONE I/O IS REQUIRED FOR THE CATALOG IF ALL USED BLOCKS WILL FIT IN
0    CORE).
- C. ACCESS METHODS
+    ______________
-    QSAM IS USED FOR THE SYSIN AND SYSPRINT FILES.  EXCP IS USED TO READ THE
0    CATALOG DATA SET.
1 D. RESTRICTIONS
+    ____________
-    ONLY SIXTEEN O/S CATALOGS MAY HAVE CONTROL CARDS PUNCHED FOR THEM IN ONE
0    EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM.  ANY NUMBER OF CATALOGS MAY BE LISTED.  THE
0    MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BLOCKS THAT MAY BE SHOWN IN THE STATISTICS IS 9,999,999.
0    (SEE "PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS" ALSO, IF YOU ARE RUNNING A VS SYSTEM).
- E. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
+    ____________________
-    BOTH THE MAIN PROGRAM AND THE CATALOG ACCESS SUBROUTINE HAVE A CORE -
0    CLEARING OPERATION AFTER A GETMAIN.  THE CODE GENERATED IS DEPENDENT ON
0    WHETHER THE CPU IS A 360 OR A 370.  BOTH PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN AS MACRO'S,
0    AND HAVE THE KEYWORK PARAMETER SYSTEM= .  THE DEFAULT VALUE IS
0    'SYSTEM=360'.  ADDITIONALLY, THE CATALOG ACCESS PROGRAM HAS THE KEYWORD
0    PARAMETER MAXCORE= .  THIS IS USED TO PUT AN UPPER LIMIT ON HOW MUCH CORE
0    WILL BE REQUESTED FROM O/S.  THE DEFAULT IS 'MAXCORE=16777208' (ALL OF
0    ADDRESSABLE CORE) AND THE MINIMUM IS 296.  FOR ANY CPU RUNNING VS, THIS
0    VALUE MUST BE CHANGED TO BE THE MAXIMUM (OR LESS) AMOUNT OF CORE TO BE
0    PAGED IN FOR THIS PROGRAM AT ONE TIME.  A SINGLE CHANNEL PROGRAM IS CON-
0    STRUCTED TO FILL CORE FROM THE CATALOG.  HENCE ALL THOSE PAGES MUST BE IN
0    REAL CORE WHEN THE I/O IS STARTED.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
-       CORE -4096 BYTES RESERVED FOR ABEND, EOV, ETC.
0             7200 BYTES - PROGRAM
0             QSAM ACCESS METHOD
0             BUFFERS - BUFNO TIMES (BLKSIZE+IOB)
0       DD CARDS -
0         SYSPRINT - FOR OUTPUT LISTING; SHOULD BE BLOCKED; PROGRAM WILL ADJUST
0                    BLOCK SIZE DOWNWARD TO A MULTIPLE OF LRECL; THE DEFAULT
0                    VALUE IS 'BLKSIZE = LRECL = '100'; USES ASA CARRIAGE
0                    CONTROL CHARACTERS.
1       SYSIN - FOR CONTROL CARDS; SHOULD BE UNBLOCKED TO MINIMIZE CORE
0             REQUIRED EVEN IN LARGE REGIONS.
0       DDCARD - ANY NAME, USED TO ALLOCATE THE DEVICE WITH THE CATALOG DATA
0             SET.
0       PCHFILE - REQUIRED ONLY IF PUNCHING IS REQUESTED; X IS A HEX DIGIT
0             STARTING WITH 0 UP TO F USED TO UNIQUELY DEFINE THE DD NAME FOR
0             MULTIPLE PUNCH REQUESTS - THE FIRST PUNCH REQUEST GOES OUT TO
0             PCHFILE0, THE SECOND TO PCHFILE1, ETC.; SHOULD BE BLOCKED; PRO-
0             GRAM WILL ADJUST BLKSIZE DOWN TO A MULTIPLE OF LRECL; THE DEFAULT
0             VALUE IS 'BLKSIZE=LRECL=80'.
- F. TECHNICAL NARRATIVE OF PROGRAM LOGIC
+     ___________________________________
-    THE PROGRAM BEGINS BY OPENING SYSIN AND SYPRINT DATA SETS.  A TEST IS MADE
0    ON WHETHER 12K OF CORE IS AVAILABLE.  IF AVAILABLE, 5376 BYTES ARE USED FOR
0    HIGH LEVEL INDEX BLOCKS.  OTHERWISE, THE BLOCKS WILL BE READ AND REREAD AS
0    REQUIRED.  A CONTROL CARD IS READ AND ANALYZED, AND SWITCHES SET TO CONTROL
0    THE FLOW THROUGH THE PROGRAM.  NEXT, THE VOLUME INDEX CONTROL ENTRY (VICE)
0    IS READ AND STATISTICS COMPUTED (IF A LISTING IS REQUESTED).

-    THE PROGRAM THEN LOCATES THE FIRST HIGH LEVEL INDEX, DATA SET, ALIAS, OR
0    CONTROL VOLUME ENTRY.  IF IT IS NOT AN INDEX ENTRY, THE PROGRAM PRINTS
0    AND/OR PUNCHES THIS INFORMATION.  IF IT IS AN INDEX ENTRY, THE PROGRAM
0    FOLLOWS THE CHAIN OF INDEX POINTERS, BUILDING A QUEUE OF THESE NAMES AS IT
0    GOES, UNTIL THE END OF THE CHAIN OR A DATA SET ENTRY IS FOUND.  THE FULLY
0    QUALIFIED NAME IS BUILT FROM THE QUEUE AND IS PRINTED AND/OR PUNCHED.

-    AFTER CHASING DOWN THE FIRST CHAIN, THE PROGRAM LOOKS FOR ANOTHER ENTRY AT
0    THE END OF THE CURRENT INDEX CHAIN TO PROCESS.  WHEN ALL ENTRIES AT THE
0    LOWEST LEVEL ARE PROCESSED, THE PROGRAM GOES UP ONE LEVEL AND ACROSS TRY-
0    ING TO FIND ANOTHER INDEX ENTRY, AND SO ON.
1    WHEN ALL THE HIGHEST LEVEL ENTRIES HAVE BEEN PROCESSED, THE PROGRAM IS
0    FINISHED WITH THE CATALOG.  THE NEXT CONTROL CARD IS READ, ANALYZED, AND
0    PERFORMED.

-    IF ERROR CONDITIONS CAUSE BRANCHING TO AN ERROR ROUTINE, A MESSAGE IS
0    WRITTEN TO SYSPRINT; OR IF SYSPRINT CAN NOT BE OPENED, TO A SYSTEM
0    MESSAGE BLOCK VIA WTO, ROUTCDE=(11).
- G. PROBABLE MODIFICATION AREAS
+    ___________________________
-    THE PROGRAM HAS A DEVICE-TYPE TO SYMBOLIC-NAME CONVERSION TABLE.  AS NEW
0    DEVICES ARE INTRODUCED, THIS TABLE SHOULD BE CHANGED SO THAT THE EIGHT
0    DIGIT HEXIDECIMAL DEVICE CODE (E.G., 30C02001) CAN BE CONVERTED INTO A
0    SYMBOLIC NAME (E.G., 2314).  ENTRIES CAN BE ADDED, DELETED, OR CHANGED
0    WITHOUT CHANGING THE PROGRAM LOGIC.  (PERFORMANCE NOTE: PLACE MOST FRE-
0    QUENTLY USED CODES FIRST IN THE TABLE).

-    TO PUNCH MORE THAN SIXTEEN CATALOGS, THE DDNAME IN THE PUNCHER DCB MUST BE
0    MODIFIED, OR, PRODUCE ALL PUNCHOUT ON A SINGLE FILE, BUT USE A TWO DIGIT
0    HIGH ORDER FIELD IN THE SEQUENCE NUMBER TO SEPARATE THE DECKS (E.G., FIRST
0    CATALOG SEQUENCE NUMBER FORMAT COULD BE X00XXXXX, THE SECOND COULD BE
0    X01XXXXX, WHERE THE X'S ARE UNDER PROGRAM CONTROL).  THE LEFTMOST (HIGH-
0    ORDER) POSITION OF THE SEQUENCE NUMBER IS USED BY THIS PROGRAM TO PUT THE
0    CATALOG REBUILD CONTROL CARDS INTO THEIR PROPER ORDER.  FOR EXAMPLE, ALL
0    INDEX BUILDING MUST BE DONE BEFORE DATA SET CATALOGING.  FIVE DIGITS FOR
0    SEQUENCING SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR ABOUT 70,000 CATALOG ENTRIES.

-    IF THE CATALOG CONTAINS CONTROL VOLUME POINTERS BUILT PRIOR TO RELEASE 18
0    (I THINK) YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT CONTROL VOLUME SYMBOLIC NAME
0    LOCATED AT DFLTCVDT IN THIS PROGRAM.

* PURPOSE -
*
*       THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE AN ACCESS METHOD TO
*  RETRIEVE CATALOG BLOCKS FROM AN O/S SYSTEM CATALOG EASILY AND
*  CHEAPLY.  ALL ACCESS IS BY THE 'LOCATE' MODE, THAT IS, WITH THE
*  ADDRESS OF THE DATA BLOCK RETURNED IN REGISTER 1.
*
*
* RESTRICTIONS AND WARNINGS -
*
*     CATALOGS ARE NOT SUPPORTED ON DATACELLS
*
*     SINCE THE CATALOG ACCESS METHOD TAKES ALL BUT 4K OF THE AVAILABLE
*  STORAGE, IF ANY OTHER IS TO REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES IT
*  MUST BE ACQUIRED BEFORE THE OPEN, AND THEN RELEASED AFTER THE OPEN.
*
* INPUTS -
*
*  REGISTERS 0 AND 1 MUST CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING VALUES -
*        OPEN SETS THE READ CCW'S SO THAT ONLY THE DATA PORTION OF
*        RECORDS IS RETURNED WHEN A 'GET' IS REQUESTED.  OPENWKEY SETS
*        THE READ CCW'S SO THAT BOTH THE KEY AND DATA PORTIONS OF
*        RECORDS ARE RETURNED WHEN A 'GET IS REQUESTED.  THE 8 BYTE
*        KEY (IF PRESENTED) IS IN FRONT OF THE 256 BYTE DATA RECORD.
* OPEN     R0=1,R1=A(8 CHARACTER LEFT JUSTIFIED DDNAME TO BE OPENED)
* OPENWKEY R0=2,R1=A(8 CHARACTER LEFT JUSTIFIED DDNAME TO BE OPENED)
* GET      R0=3,R1=ANY VALUE - GET THE NEXT (KEY AND) DATA BLOCK ADDRES
* GETBYTTR R0=4,R1=A(3 BYTE RELATIVE TRACK ADDRESS) - GET THE (KEY AND)
*              DATA BLOCK AT THE SPECIFIED TTR.
* CLOSE    R0=5,R1=ANY VALUE - CLOSE THE FILE
*
* OUTPUTS -
*
*     FOR OPEN AND OPENWKEY, THE DCB WILL BE OPENED
*     FOR GET OR GETBYTTR, THE ADDRESS OF THE REQUESTED DATA BLOCK WILL
*          BE RETURNED IN REGISTER 1.
*     FOR CLOSE, THE DCB WILL BE CLOSED

*
* PURPOSE -
*
*       THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE AN ACCESS METHOD TO
*  RETRIEVE DATA SET CONTROL BLOCKS FROM AN O/S VTOC EASILY AND
*  CHEAPLY.  ALL ACCESS IS BY THE 'LOCATE' MODE, THAT IS, WITH THE
*  ADDRESS OF THE DATA BLOCK RETURNED IN REGISTER 1.
*
* RESTRICTIONS AND WARNINGS -
*
*     SINCE THE VTOC ACCESS METHOD TAKES ALL BUT 4K OF THE AVAILABLE
*  STORAGE ( UP TO MAXCORE ), IF ANY OTHER IS TO REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR
*  OTHER PURPOSES IT MUST BE ACQUIRED BEFORE THE OPEN AND RELEASED
*  AFTER THE OPEN, OR MAXCORE MUST BE SET UP FOR A LIMITED SIZE.
*
*
* INPUTS -
*
*  REGISTERS 0 AND 1 MUST CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING VALUES -
*        OPEN SETS THE READ CCW'S SO THAT ONLY THE DATA PORTION OF
*        RECORDS IS RETURNED WHEN A 'GET' IS REQUESTED.  OPENWKEY SETS
*        THE READ CCW'S SO THAT BOTH THE KEY AND DATA PORTIONS OF
*        RECORDS ARE RETURNED WHEN A 'GET IS REQUESTED.  THE 44 BYTE
*        KEY (IF PRESENTED) IS IN FRONT OF THE 96 BYTE DATA RECORD.
* OPEN     R0=1,R1=A(8 CHARACTER LEFT JUSTIFIED DDNAME TO BE OPENED)
* OPENWKEY R0=2,R1=A(8 CHARACTER LEFT JUSTIFIED DDNAME TO BE OPENED)
* GET      R0=3,R1=ANY VALUE - GET THE NEXT (KEY AND) DATA BLOCK ADDRES
* GETBYCHR R0=4,R1=A(5 BYTE ADDRESS OF CCHHR) - GET THE (KEY AND)
*              DATA BLOCK AT THE SPECIFIED CCHHR.
* CLOSE    R0=5,R1=ANY VALUE - CLOSE THE FILE
*
* OUTPUTS -
*
*     FOR OPEN AND OPENWKEY, THE DCB WILL BE OPENED, AND THE NUMBER OF
*          DATA BLOCKS PER TRACK RETURNED IN R1.
*     FOR GET OR GETBYCHR, THE ADDRESS OF THE REQUESTED DATA BLOCK WILL
*          BE RETURNED IN REGISTER 1.
*     FOR CLOSE, THE DCB WILL BE CLOSED
         EJECT
* MACRO 'VTOC' USAGE -
*
* ONLY ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE PROGRAMS MAY CALL THIS ACCESS METHOD.
* THE MACRO 'VTOC' IS AVAILABLE TO FACILITATE THE CALLING OF THIS
* PROGRAM.  THE FORMATS ALLOWED ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.
*
*     OPEN REQUEST
*
*        VTOC  OPEN,DDNMSYMB      'OPEN' MUST BE CODED AS SHOWN.
*                                 'DDNMSYMB' IS THE ASSEMBLER SYMBOL OF
*                                 AN 8 CHARACTER LEFT-JUSTIFIED DDNAME
*                                 TO BE OPENED FOR INPUT OF DATA BLOCKS
*                                 ONLY (NO KEYS).
*        VTOC  OPENWKEY,DDNMSYMB  SAME AS ABOVE, BUT OPENED WITH KEYS.
*
*     CLOSE REQUEST
*
*        VTOC  CLOSE              'CLOSE' MUST BE CODED AS SHOWN.
*
*     GET REQUEST
*
*        VTOC  GET                'GET' MUST BE CODED AS SHOWN.  WHEN
*                                 R15 = 0, R1 = A(DATA) OR A(KEY+DATA).
*                                 IF R15 NOT = 0, R1 IS INDETERMINATE.
*                                 SEE 'OPENWKEY' ABOVE.
*        VTOC  GETBYCHR,CHRSYMB   'GETBYCHR' MUST BE CODED AS SHOWN.
*                                 'CHRSYMB' IS THE ASSEMBLER SYMBOL
*                                 OF A 5 BYTE AREA CONTAINING THE
*                                 FULL DISK ADDRESS OF THE DESIRED
*                                 DATA BLOCK.  SEE 'OPENWKEY' ABOVE.
*
*     ALTERNATE CODINGS -  WHERE A SECOND OPERAND IS CODED, (1) MAY BE
*                          USED IF R1 CONTAINS THE ADDRESS OF THE
*                          REQUIRED AREA.  (REGNAME) MAY ALSO BE USED
*                          WHERE 'REGNAME' IS A SYMBOLIC REGISTER, IF
