* *      HAVE HAD THIS CODE FOR A WHILE AND FINALLY GOT AROUND    * *
* *      TO PUTTING IT ON THE TAPE. IT IS REAL USEFUL FOR         * *

* *      GO INTO A FILE PRECEDING SOME DATA, REMEMBER TO PUT      * *

*        "BLOKHEAD" IS A SHORT PROGRAM WHICH WILL PROVIDE BLOCK     *
*  LETTER HEADINGS ON A DATA SET USING THE MODIFIED "IEFSD095"*     *
*  ROUTINE TO GENERATE THE LETTERS.  IT IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR  *
*  HEADING MICROFILM WITH IDENTIFYING FRAMES WHICH ARE READABLE     *
*  WITHOUT INSERTION INTO A VIEWER.                                 *
*                                                                   *
*        "BLOKHEAD" MAY BE INVOKED EITHER BY EXECUTE CARD OR IT     *
*  MAY BE LINKED TO DIRECTLY.  THE INFORMATION TO BE PRINTED IS     *
*  PASSED IN THE PARAMETER OF THE EXECUTE CARD IN THE FORM:         *
*                                                                   *

*  THE FIRST PARAMETER IS THE DDNAME OF THE DATA SET TO RECEIVE     *
*  THE HEADING.  IF PRESENT, IT MUST BE INCLOSED IN PARENTHESES.    *
*  IF OMITTED, "SYSPRINT" WILL BE ASSUMED.  THE REMAINING PARAMETERS*
*  ARE THE LINES TO BE PRINTED.  "BLOKHEAD" WILL ATTEMPT TO PUT     *
*  EACH PARAMETER ON A LINE BY ITSELF, BUT IF THE LINE WILL NOT     *
*  HOLD THE FULL PARAMETER, IT WILL BE SPLIT UP.  EACH LINE WILL    *
*  BE CENTERED ON THE PAGE.  THE PARAMETERS MAY CONTAIN ANY VALID   *
*  PN/QN CHAIN CHARACTER PLUS THE EXCLAMATION POINT AND CENT SIGN.  *
*  SINCE THE COMMA WAS USED ABOVE TO DELIMIT THE PARAMETERS, IT     *
*  MAY NOT BE A PART OF A PARAMETER;  HOWEVER, ANY CHARACTER (EXCEPT*
*  AN OPEN PARENTHESIS) MAY BE USED TO DELIMIT THE PARAMETER STRING.*
*  FOR EXAMPLE:                                                     *
*                                                                   *

*  COULD BE USED TO PRINT THE TWO LINES "A,B,C" AND "D,E,F".        *
*  TWO CONSECUTIVE DELIMITERS WILL CAUSE A PAGE EJECT.  IF A LINE   *
*  CONSISTS ONLY OF THE CENT SIGN CHARACTER, A FULL PAGE OF         *
*  ASTERISKS WILL BE PRINTED.  THE FINAL DELIMITER IS OPTIONAL.     *

*  PROVIDED IN A FORMAT COMPATABLE TO THE EXEC CARD---THAT IS,      *
*  REGISTER 1 SHOULD POINT TO A HALF-WORD CHARACTER COUNT FOLLOWED  *
