| Abstract - LISTPDS is an data set utility program for listing and/or |
|            punching source libraries or data sets.  It generates     |
|            formatted listings of a PDS's directory, the contents of  |
|            processed members or sequential files, as well as (option-|
|            ally) punching processed members and/or sequential data   |
|            sets.  Records may be generated which allow the output to |
|            be used in conjunction with the IBM utility IEBUPDTE.     |
|                                                                      |

|                For    - Listing 2 partitioned data sets with 198 mem-|
|                         bers containing a total of 7903 records:     |

|           SYSLIST  - If included, this file will contain the         |
|                      listing of the requested data sets.  Required   |
|                      when the LIST option is used.                   |
|                                                                      |
|           SYSLIB   - The file containing the partitioned and/or      |
|                      sequential data set(s) to be processed.  If     |
|                      specific members are to be processed, each      |
|                      partitioned dataset will be used. Data sets may |
|                      be concatenated to SYSLIB in any mix of file    |
|                      organization and dataset type.                  |
|                                                                      |
|           SYSPUNCH - If included, this file will contain the output  |
|                      (as 80-byte records) for the members requested. |
|                      This DD statement is required when either the   |
|                      DECK or UPDTE options are used.                 |
|                                                                      |

|                      Only the first partitioned data set of SYSLIB   |
|                      will be used. When SYSIN is empty, DUMMY, or not|
|                      included, all members of SYSLIB are processed.  |
|                      If the EXCLUDE option is specified, all members |
|                      other than those specified in the SYSIN file    |
|                      will be listed.  The EXCLUDE/SELECT option is   |
|                      ignored if SYSIN is a null data set (DUMMY or   |
|                      DD card) or if the NOSEL option is specified.   |

|               LIST     - Produce a listing of the contents of the    |
|                          data sets in the SYSLIB file on SYSLIST.    |
|                          The DD statement SYSLIST is required.       |
|                                                                      |
|               NOLIST   - Used to turn off the listing of data sets   |
|                          and/or members in the SYSLIB file to        |
|                          SYSLIST. If coded, the SYSLIST DD statement |
|                          is not required. The default is LIST.       |
|                                                                      |
|               DECK     - Produce card images of the contents of the  |
|                          members in the SYSLIB file on SYSPUNCH.     |
|                          Default is NODECK. The SYSPUNCH DD statement|
|                          is required when this option is used.       |
|                                                                      |
|               NODECK   - Do not produce card images on SYSPUNCH.     |
|                                                                      |
|               LISTDIR  - Produces only a listing of the directory    |
|                          entries for the members.  No record count   |
|                          is given and less I/O time is required. If  |
|                          coded the SYSLIST DD statement is not       |
|                          required. The default is not to list this.  |
|                                                                      |
|               UPDTE    - If coded IEBUPDTE utility ADD statements    |
|                          will be produced on SYSPUNCH. When DECK is  |
|                          also specified they will precede each       |
|                          member. The SYSPUNCH DD statement is        |
|                          required for UPDTE. If a member contains    |
|                          IEBUPDTE statements, the './' statements    |
|                          within the member will be written with '><' |
|                          in place of the './' characters. The        |
|                          The default value is NOUPDTE.               |

|               SSI      - If coded along with UPDTE the system status |
|                          information is included on the IEBUPDTE ADD |
|                          statements produced on SYSPUNCH.  The       |
|                          SYSPUNCH DD statement is required for UPDTE.|
|                          Default is NOSSI.                           |

|               NUM      - Output mode for the NUM option will have    |
|                          the line number on the left margin followed |
|                          by a space and then the remainder of the    |

|                          first 8 bytes record.  This applies to both |
|                          partitioned and sequential organization data|

|                          with the same format as the record image.   |

|               TEXT     - Controls the selection of a translate table |
|                          for 'XLATE'. Printed text will converted    |
|                          from lower case to upper case.              |

|  Control statements - When the SYSIN file contains records, each data|
|             set (partitioned only) is searched based on the contents |
|             of the SYSIN file. Sequential data sets are not affected |
|             by the SYSIN file. The member names must start in byte 1 |
|             and be separated by commas.  A blank will start a comment|
|             field. Bytes 73 - 80 as well as the comments are ignored.|

|              'USER.SEQ.FILE' is a sequential file with RECFM=FB      |
|              and LRECL=80.  UPDTE(><) will change any './' cards     |
|              found in columns 1-2 to '><' so there will not be a     |
|              problem on reload.  Optionally if you use Bill          |
|              Godfrey's reload utility to convert this sequential     |
|              file back to a PDS, the members will be converted       |
|              back to './' automatically  (PDSLOAD is another         |
|              utility also in the SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER's TOOL BOX).     |
