*  FUNCTION : NETINIT IS A VTAM APPLICATION PROGRAM USED TO CONTROL   *
*             THE STARTUP OF OTHER VTAM APPLICATION PROGRAMS. IT IS   *
*             STARTED AT IPL TIME AND ENSURES THAT CERTAIN VTAM       *
*             APPLICATION PROGRAMS ARE STARTED AND STARTED IN         *
*             A PARTICULAR ORDER.                                     *
*                                                                     *
*             SEVERAL VTAM APPLICATIONS SUCH AS TCAS, NCCF AND HCF    *
*             CURRENTLY REQUIRE OPERATOR INTERVENTION TO START THEM.  *
*             THEY ARE UNABLE TO HANDLE THE SITUATION WHEN THEY       *
*             ARE STARTED BEFORE VTAM IS COMPLETELY INITIALIZED.      *
*             EITHER THEY ABEND OR THEY REQUIRE A REPLY FROM THE      *
*             OPERATOR TO RETRY THEIR STARTUP.                        *
*                                                                     *
*             CURRENTLY, BOTH NCCF AND NETOP CAN BE A PRIMARY         *
*             PROGRAM OPERATOR. NETOP WILL START CORRECTLY IF THE     *
*             POI IS IN USE BY ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT NCCF WILL NOT.     *
*             SINCE BOTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN USE, NETOP CAN        *
*             BE STARTED ONLY AFTER NCCF IS RUNNING.                  *
*                                                                     *
*             NETINIT WILL ADDRESS THE ABOVE PROBLEMS.                *
*                                                                     *
*             FIRST, NETINIT READS IN A SET OF COMMAND RECORDS. EACH  *
*             COMMAND RECORD DEFINES A PARTICULAR OS COMMAND          *
*             THAT IS TO BE ISSUED USING SVC 34. THE LEVEL            *
*             NUMBERS ARE USED TO DEFINE A HIERARCHY FOR EXECUTION    *
*             OF THE COMMANDS. HIGHER LEVELS ARE SUBORDINATE TO THE   *
*             LOWER LEVELS THEY FOLLOW IN THE INPUT STREAM. ALL       *
*             COMMANDS WITH IDENTICAL LEVEL NUMBERS AND WHICH ARE     *
*             SUBORDINATE TO ONE LOWER LEVEL COMMAND, CAN BE          *
*             ISSUED IN PARALLEL. A HIGHER LEVEL COMMAND CAN ONLY BE  *
*             EXECUTED ONCE ANY LOWER LEVEL COMMANDS PRIOR TO IT      *
*             IN THE INPUT STREAM HAVE BEEN EXECUTED.                 *
*                                                                     *
*             EG. THIS INPUT COMMAND FILE:                            *
*                                                                     *
*             LEVEL #   COMMAND                                       *
*             *******   *******                                       *

*                1      $SLGN1                                        *
*                2      $SLNE90                                       *
*                1      S HCF                                         *
*                                                                     *
*                 WOULD RESULT IN THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE OF COMMANDS: *
*                                                                     *
*             S NCCF      S TCAS     $SLGN1      S HCF                *
*             S NETOP                $SLNE90                          *
*                                                                     *
*                 WHERE EXECUTION OF EACH COLUMN OF COMMANDS WOULD    *
*                 PROCEED IN PARALLEL BUT EACH ROW IN A PARTICULAR    *
*                 COLUMN MUST WAIT FOR THE PREVIOUS ROW COMMAND       *
*                 TO COMPLETE.                                        *
*                                                                     *
*             THESE COMMANDS ARE READ INTO THE VTAM STARTUP TABLE     *
*             AND EDITTED FOR OBVIOUS FORMAT ERRORS.                  *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*             SECOND, NETINIT WAITS UNTIL IT CAN SUCCESSFULLY OPEN    *
*             ITS VTAM ACB.                                           *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*             THIRD, NETINIT PROCESS THE COMMANDS IT READ INTO        *
*             THE VTAM STARTUP TABLE.                                 *
*                                                                     *
*             NETINIT CAN PROCESS TWO TYPES OF COMMAND RECORDS.       *
*             THE VTAM COMMAND RECORDS DEFINE START COMMANDS FOR      *
*             VTAM APPLICATIONS. NETINIT WILL ISSUE THE GIVEN         *
*             COMMAND AND THEN USE THE INQUIRE MACRO TO WAIT UNTIL    *
*             THE ASSOCIATED VTAM APPLICATION BECOMES ACTIVE. FOR THE *
*             COMMAND COMMAND RECORDS, NETINIT ISSUES THE GIVEN       *
*             COMMAND BUT DOESN'T MONITOR FOR ITS COMPLETION.         *
*                                                                     *
*             FOURTH, NETINIT CAN DELAY PROCESSING OF CERTAIN         *
*             COMMANDS DEPENDANT UPON A USER SPECIFIED TIME           *
*             INTERVAL.                                               *
*                                                                     *
*              EX. 1 V 300 T NCCF S NCCF                              *
*                                                                     *
*             THE 'T' INPUT WOULD RESULT IN A DELAY PRIOR TO          *
*             ISSUTING THIS COMMAND.  THE DELAY IS DEPENDANT          *
*             UPON THE INPUT VALUE PROVIDED IN 'SYSIN'.  IN THIS      *
*             CASE THE REQUESTED DELAY IS '300' OR 5 MINUTES.         *
*             THE VALUE IS 001 IS EQUAL TO 1 SEC.  YOU MAY ENTER      *
*             WHAT YOU WISH FOR DELAY PRIOR TO ISSUING COMMAND.       *
*                                                                     *
*             FIFTH , NETINIT WRITES MESSAGES TO THE OPERATOR         *
*             WHEN ERROR CONDITIONS ARE ENCOUNTERED. FOR EXAMPLE,     *
*             NETINIT SETS TIMEOUT VALUES FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME      *
*             IT WILL ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE ACB BEFORE QUITTING AND     *
*             FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME IT WILL WAIT FOR AN APPLICATION  *
*             TO BECOME ACTIVE.                                       *
*                                                                     *
*             SIXTH, NETINIT CAN BE RERUN AT ANY TIME. BEFORE         *
*             STARTING ANY VTAM APPLICATION, THE STATUS OF THAT       *
*             APPLICATION IS CHECKED WITH INQUIRE MACRO. START        *
*             COMMANDS ARE IGNORED FOR ANY ACTIVE APPLICATIONS. ALL   *
*             'COMMAND' COMMANDS ARE ISSUED REGARDLESS OF ANY         *
*             ASSOCIATED STATUS. THE USER MUST ENSURE THAT ANY        *
*             SUCH COMMANDS WILL NOT INTERFER WITH A CURRENTLY        *
*             ACTIVE VTAM APPLICATION PROGRAM.                        *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*             ** INITIAL 80 BYTE RECORD IS 'STOP'  IN COL 11. **      *
*                                                                     *
* FUNCTION :  NETINIT MAY ALSO BE USED TO PROCESS NETWORK             *
*             SHUTDOWN IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER.                       *
*                                                                     *
*             CODE INITIAL LINE ENTRY AS 'STOP'                       *
*                                                                     *
*             NETINIT WILL THEN CHECK ITS ACB.  IF ACB OPEN           *
*             OK ACB IS CLOSED AND MULTIPLE COMMANDS MAY BE           *
*             ISSUED TO STOP TASKS ORIGINALLY INITIATED               *
*             THROUGH NETINIT STARTUP PROC.                           *
*             THESE COMMANDS ARE PROCESSED IN THE SAME MANNER         *
*             AS THE NETINIT START UP PROCEDURE IN THAT               *
*             THEY ARE DEPENDANT ON LOWER LEVEL COMPLETIONS           *
*             WITHIN THE INPUT COMMAND MEMBER LEVEL STRUCTURE         *
*             AS WELL AS THE TIMING OPTION MAY BE USED TO             *
*             DELAY COMMAND INVOCATION.                               *
