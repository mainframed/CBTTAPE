  WORM   : Wonderful-Online-Response-Monitor
  -------- CBT origin : Extracted from CBT tape 91 MAR, files 134-135.
           Written October 1986 by GREG PRICE of PRYCROFT SIX PTY LTD.

  Use    : for use under TSO on 3270-family VDU in fullscreen mode.
  -------- WORM supports all screen sizes.

  Object : For the worm to eat the numbers appearing on the screen
  -------- without colliding with itself or the border around the
           screen. When a number is eaten (by moving the worm's head
           (denoted by a '@') to the number's location) another number
           will appear at a random vacant location. The value of the
           eaten number will be added to the score and the worm's
           length will also increase by that amount. Collisions are
           denoted by a '+' then a '*' one second later, and cause the
           worm to die due to brain damage caused by shocking head
           injuries.

  Method : Once the worm is moving ten (10) TGETs are done one-tenth
  -------- of a second apart. If no input is received the worm is
           moved one location in the current direction. When
           wormomatic is active only one (1) TGET is done when in
           burst mode, or two (2) TGETs one-tenth of a second apart
           otherwise. The current meaning of PF1 (displayed in the
           title line) and the move speed indicate the current
           AUTOMATIC/MANUAL/BURSY mode status.

           An optional program parameter or TSO command operand
           (depending upon the method of invocation) of one or two
           decimal digits may be supplied. This specifies a target
           upper limit to task-type cpu time consumption by wormo-
           matic expressed in terms of percentage of elapsed time. The
           default of zero means that wormomatic will not try to limit
           its cpu service absorption rate.

                     move
           PF 9/21 - move unconditionally (unless a number is encounte-
                     red) eight (8) locations in the current direction
           PF10/22 - change the current direction to RIGHT and make a
                     move
           PF11/23 - change the current direction to LEFT and make a
                     move
           PF12/24 - CANCEL - end without scoring
           Enter causes a move in the current direction to be made
           immediately. PA keys and PF keys 1/13, 2/14, 4/16, 5/17 and
           6/18 are the only ones which will not stop wormomatic while
           it is active. Attention interrupt (PA1) stops wormomatic.

           If the file ISPTABL (can be changed to any PDS DD which
           effectively has UACC(UPDATE)) is allocated then the highest
           score is kept as user data (PFD (not SPF) stats) of member
           EWSBTA## (REVIEW will show PFD and SPF stats) where ## is
           the number of lines that the screen has. File name PFDATTRS
           is used under OSIV/F4.

           If the terminal's VTAM query bit is on then arrows are used
           for the worm instead of lower case 'O's (this also means
           "unwinding" information is available to the player), the
           '@' for the head is replaced by a blob, and the target
           number will be displayed in reverse video. An alternate
           graphic display mode is available which shows the worm as a
           continuous line and the head as a block. Line mode is
           similated in non-graphic mode with dashes etc. The initial
           worm is white, but each worm food target is artificially
           coloured at random. No preservatives added. The worm will
           gradually take on the colour of the most recently consumed
           food. No two consecutive food targets will have the same
           colour. 7-colour displays are only transmitted in "graphic"
           mode. PF6/18 is available to activate/deactivate "graphic"
           mode, which is initially on only if the VTAM query bit for
           the tso terminal is on and the query indicated 7-colour
           support. If the query does not indicate graphics escape
           support then APL/graphic characters will not be used even
           if seven colours are. Reverse video mode can be activated

                                                      WORM      3/3.

           and deactivated by PF2/14 independently of graphic mode
           (PF2/14 used to activate debug mode when in burst mode, but
           this has now been disabled).


           It really doesn't look much like a worm in "graphic" mode.
           Normal mode looks better on a 3180 anyway, as well as
           reducing data traffic. Note that "graphic" information is
           not sent to the terminal for screen RESHOW/REFRESH.

           Terminal I/O can be speeded up with the use of "burst"
           mode. Instead of one TPUT per move a data stream of over 3K
           can be accumulated and sent in one TPUT. Eating a number
           also triggers a TPUT. "burst" mode is only used in
           automatic mode.

           If invoked as 'HALFWORM' or 'HW' then only the top half
           (integer arithmetic) of the screen will be used. Naturally
           a different scoreboard member will be used. Similarly with
           'QUARTERW' and 'QW'.

           If invoked as 'WORMTEST' (full-screen), 'HALFTEST' (half-
           screen) or 'QUARTEST' (quarter-screen) then food-generation
           test mode will be active and a worm will not be produced.
           Speed and colour modes are controlled as described earlier.
           Initially the screen will be filled up with food targets,
           but then pF4/16 will request generation continuation
           without regard to previous occupancy of the selected
           position. If the screen is cleared at this stage, random
           number generator peculiarities such as timer unit
           granularity (low-order bit always off perhaps) may become
           apparent. PF3/15 then pF4/16 may be done anytime.

           The above has been changed such that pF4/16 is replaced by
           pF1-8/13-20. PF1-7/13-19 specify the colour code to be used
           unconditionally. PF8/20 reactivates random colour
           generation. Remember that this function is only available
           at end-of-test via pF3/15 or via fully-covered screen.

  Notes :  WORM must be APF authorized if the user's TPUT and transac-
  -------     tion counters are to be decremented. In any event, this
              decrementing will only be performed on MVS (MVS/370 or
              MVS/XA) systems.
           OSIV/F4 : TGETs/TPUTs make tasks non-dispatchable under F4.
              In MVS, tasks are put into a wait state. Hence, TSS users
              don't timeout like TSO users (S522 abend). Also, TGET
              NOWAIT macros stop the TCBs until a TSS terminal keyboard
              attention occurs. Therefore, WORM does not "tick over"
              under F4. So, no TGETs are issued when wormomatic is
              active under F4. To stop wormomatic on TSS ATTN/PA1 is
              required. MVS was like this too, originally, wasn't it?
              (PRE-3.7? SVS?)
