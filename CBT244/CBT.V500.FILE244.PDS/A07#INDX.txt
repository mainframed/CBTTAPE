SMFSCAN consists of the following programs :-
A07PARSE   smfparse - parses sysin input. This program is the main
                       entry point. It calls SMFSCANT to print titles
                       then it validates the SYSIN data stream and then
                       (if all is OK) links to SMFSCANR.

 A07SCANT   smfscant - prints the title pages for SMFSCAN. This program
 ---------             will print the title depending at what stage the
                       program has got. ie SYSIN REPORT or REPORT.
                       This program links to DATE.

 A07SCANR   smfscanr - process the input file and produces the report.
 --------              This program also links to SMFSCANT and DATE.

 SMFSCAN will produce a report, from SMF TYPE 30 records, of whatever
 is specified in the SYSIN data stream. User instructions are held in
