         GUIDE GOODIES      1993 'A'
         =============      ========

This dataset has been built up from several contributions collected
over the last few months to form the first cut of a new goodies file.

Where member names have not conformed to the requested format the
first three characters in most cases have been changed to 'Ann' so
beware if compiling programs as member names will need adjusting to
what the program expects.  -  sorry but its the only way to keep the
tape in a sensible format.

Each company contribution has an individual 3 character prefix and
an index member.  To help evaluate the dataset all of the index members
are copied into this member as well.

Good luck  --    Philip Pecksen         Sept 1993

  This library contains the following goodies:-

   1. An edit macro called ZOOM which will display a JCL procedure
      while editing JCL. The cursor is placed on an EXEC statement
      in your job and the ZOOM command entered. The JCL proc will
      be displayed via a browse panel.

      Member Names:   A02ZOOM



   2. An edit macro called JOBC which will generate a job card.
      This macro displays an entry panel and is documented via
      tutorial panels. The job standard is for L.O.L.A.'s  set
      up but can be changed.

      Member Names:   JOBC,A02N021,A02N0211    -  edit macros
                      A02N021                  -  entry panel
                      A02MGN02                 -  messages
                      A02N....                 -  Help panels


   3. A program called Z7504 that will convert awkward characters
      such as ampersands and brackets in CLIST variables to other
      characters so that the CLIST can complete normally. This was
      written to cater for the situation where someone enters an
      ampersand in an ISPF panel variable and when the CLIST tries
      to do anything with the variable it blows up.

      Member Names:   A02Z7504             -  program
                      A02SETUP,A02CLEAR    -  macros
                      A0JVARS              -  JCL to assemble/link


   4. A program called Z3426 - a CPU soak program to manage CPU
      resource. This program as it stands requires ACF2 but could be
      changed if ACF2 is not your security product.

      Member Names:   A02Z3426                 -  program
                      A02SETUP,A02CLEAR        -  macros
                                     Also uses ACF2 macros
                      A02SOAK                  -  JCL to assemble/link

SMFSCAN consists of the following programs :-
A07PARSE   smfparse - parses sysin input. This program is the main
                       entry point. It calls SMFSCANT to print titles
                       then it validates the SYSIN data stream and then
                       (if all is OK) links to SMFSCANR.

 A07SCANT   smfscant - prints the title pages for SMFSCAN. This program
 ---------             will print the title depending at what stage the
                       program has got. ie SYSIN REPORT or REPORT.
                       This program links to DATE.

 A07SCANR   smfscanr - process the input file and produces the report.
 --------              This program also links to SMFSCANT and DATE.

 SMFSCAN will produce a report, from SMF TYPE 30 records, of whatever
 is specified in the SYSIN data stream. User instructions are held in
 this PDS as member A07SMDOC
