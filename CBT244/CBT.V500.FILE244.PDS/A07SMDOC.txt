                              Description
                              -----------

 SMFSCAN will produce reports from SMF TYPE 30 records of JOB activity.

 It is NOT intended as a IFASMFDP replacement, indeed IFASMFDP should
 be used for selecting SMF TYPE 30 for input to SMFSCAN to reduce the
 EXCP count of SMFSCAN.

   These reports can be tailored by the user by use of SYSIN control
 cards. These control cards must be 80 byte records, they can however
 be continued on several cards by coding a comma after the parameter. If
 there is an error encountered on any control card the remainder of the
 control cards are ignored and NO report from the SMF records will be
 produced. SMFSCAN will also in this instance return a condition code of
 16.

   It should be noted that SMFSCAN will only produce one report i.e. if
 more than one report is required out of SMFSCAN then a multstep job
 must be run to execute SMFSCAN for each report required.

   The SYSIN cards are free format. For a description of the control
 card parameters refer to the relevant portion of this document.

                               Sample JCL
                               ----------

   The JCL required to run SMFSCAN is described below.

  CARD   COMMENT
  ----   ------------------------------------------------------------
   1     Required. Any valid site JOB card.

   2     Required. EXEC card. No parameters are needed

   3     Optional. This card defines the load library in which SMFSCAN
                   resides, if this library is defined in the
                   SYS1.PARMLIB member LNKLSTxx then this card may be
                   omitted.

   4     Required. This is the report output file.

   5     Required. This is the file that contains the SMF TYPE 30
                   records. It is suggested that it contains only TYPE
                   30 records in order to keep the IO's to a minimum.

   6     Optional. This is the input control card file. If it is omitted
                   ALL jobs in ALL classes will be reported on. If it is
                   coded it must have a LRECL of 80 bytes.

                             Sample Jobstream
                             ----------------

    The following sample jobstream is an example of how to extract TYPE
 30 records for processing by SMFSCAN.

        report on all jobs that begin with P2000

   e).  To report on jobs whose name contain a specific string code /
        i.e. JOBS=(/2000) will report on all jobs whose names contain
        the string 2000 anywhere in their names.

   f).  The parameter can be coded as either JOB or JOBS.

   g).  / and * are mutally exclusive in the same critera i.e /P22*

   h). IMPORTANT jobs are selected or rejected by matching from the
       leftmost critera to the rightmost. This means that if a job is
       rejected by one critera it cannot be selected by a subsequent one

                   Examples On How To Code The JOB Parameter
                   -----------------------------------------


 Here is a list of JOB parameter examples and a description of their
 effect, if any.

 JOB=(P2000KF1) or JOBS=P2000KF1

 Valid..... Only selects jobs called P2000KF1 for reporting.


 JOB=(¬P2000KF1) or JOBS=¬P2000KF1

 Valid..... Only selects jobs not called P2000KF1 for reporting.


 JOBS=(/HSKP)

 Valid..... Only selects jobs whose names contain the string HSKP
            anywhere in their names. e.g. CHSKP31L, P200HSKP would be
            selected for reporting.


 JOBS=(¬/HSKP)

 Valid..... Only selects jobs whose names do not contain the string
            HSKP anywhere in their names. e.g. CHSKP31L, P200HSKP would
            be selected for reporting.


 JOBS=(¬/HS*)

 Invalid .. / and * are mutually exclusive in the same critera.


 JOBS=(P2000*,/HSKP)

 Valid .... This will select jobs whose names begin P2000 or whose names
            contain the string HSKP.
