 NEW UTILITY - UTALLOW
+___ _______   _______

 A new utility called "UTALLOW" is available.  It has been written as a
 general utility to check that certain Jobs are not run alongside other
 Jobs, e.g. System Securities,  or that Jobs are only  run when certain
 other Jobs are running, e.g. when ADABASPR is available.

 If used, "UTALLOW" must be the first stop in the Job,  it requires JCL
 of the form :-

      //stepname EXEC PGM=UTALLOW,PARM=parm
      //ALLOW    DD   DSN=DCC.PROCDATA(member1),DISP=SHR
      //EXCLUDE  DD   DSN=DCC.PROCDATA(member2),DISP=SHR
      //REQUIRE  DD   DSN=DCC.PROCDATA(member3),DISP=SHR

 The "PARM" parameter is optional. If used, it forces "UTALLOW" to take
 certain actions when an invalid Job combination is found:-

    W(ait)   - Wait until the Job can run ("UTALLOW" will retry itself
               at one minute intervals).
    I(gnore) - Will over-ride "UTALLOW"  and allow the Job to run.  An
               informatory message is given.
    C(ancel) - Will abend the Job immediately with a "U0999" dump.

 If no "PARM" parameter is used,  or an invalid parameter  is enterred,
 "UTALLOW" will issue a message to the Operator for action when the Job
 cannot be run.

 The PROCDATA members are optional.  If used,  they must be card images
 with Job Names in Cols 1-8. UTALLOW will allow the Job to run provided
 only the standard MVS tasks or Jobs in the "ALLOW" member are running,
 no Jobs in the "EXCLUDE" member are running and all of the Jobs in the
 "REQUIRE" member are running. Note :-

   1) Omission of a PROCDATA member,  or a null member,  will result in
      the corresponding feature being ignored.
   2) Duplication of a name in "ALLOW" and "EXCLUDE" will exclude.
   3) "REQUIRE" forces "ALLOW" and prohibits "EXCLUDE".
   4) "NET", "CICS0" and "CICSNITE" are considered standard, but can be
      "EXCLUDEd".
   5) The MVS "TSO" address space is considered standard, but TSO users
      are not, unless "ALLOWed".
   6) Job Names in the "ALLOW"  and "EXCLUDE"  members may be masked by
      use of "+" signs, eg:-

      CICS++++ covers all CICS.
      CICS+    covers CICS0-CICS5, does not cover CICSTEST/CICSNITE.
      ADABAS++ covers all ADABAS.
      TSO++++  covers all TSO user-ids.
      ++++++++ covers all Jobs.

 If UTALLOW finds Jobs running, which are not allowed, or jobs missing,
 which are required, it will issue messages listing the problem job(s).  .
 If it has a valid "PARM", it will take the appropriate action,  other-
 -wise a further  message giving four options is sent to the Operator:-

    REQUEUE  - Requeue the job to the JES2 input queue and hold.
    WAIT     - Wait until the Job can run  ("UTALLOW" will retry itself
               immediately, then at one minute intervals).
    IGNORE   - Will over-ride "UTALLOW" and allow the Job to run.
    CANCEL   - Will abend the Job with a "U0999" dump.

 Note :-

   1) Only the first letter of the reply is checked, eg. "W" = "WAIT".
   2) "REQUEUE"  will be the favoured option  in most cases,  it is not
      available as a "PARM" as Systems Programmers consider Jobs should
      only by re-queued by direct action from the Operators.
   3) "WAIT" will have only a small overhead and should be suitable for
      most Jobs.  A Job in  "WAIT"  can be re-queued  with the standard
      "RESTART" utility, or cancelled altogether
   4) "IGNORE" must be confirmed by a further reply "Y".
   5) The default action, for an unrecognised reply, is "CANCEL".

 "UTALLOW"  was designed for  System Programmers  own use within System
 Securities. It is available for general use in Production Jobs.
