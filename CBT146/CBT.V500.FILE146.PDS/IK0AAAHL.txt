KERMIT-370 4.0 RELEASE NOTES, June 28, 1988

Kermit-370 4.0 has been beta-tested under both MVS/TSO and VM/CMS at various
sites, and success has been reported with the following models:

  IBM Series/1 with Yale IUP
  IBM 7171
  IBM 4994
  Leedata 8010 (Lee Data Corp)
  Leedata 8030
  Leedata 874
  Micom 7400   (Micom Systems Inc)
  PCI 1076     (Protocol Computers Inc)
  PCI 276
  Renex TMS-1  (Renex Corp)

(Leedata is also the new name for Datastream.)  We also have indirect reports
that a product called the "Hydra II" works OK with Kermit-370.

Kermit-370 should work with any protocol converter that supports some kind of
"transparent mode" or "passthrough mode".  Sometimes this takes the form
of "graphics mode".  Kermit-370 cannot tell what kind of protocol converter
it's going through, so it assumes it to be an IBM model, and issues the IBM
command for transparent mode.  If this doesn't work, the user can try the
Kermit-370 command SET CONTROLLER GRAPHICS.

Certain models are known not to work with Kermit-370.  These include:

  Any PC board that attaches to coax cable, like the Irma board or the
  IBM 3270 emulation board.

  SIM3278 (a software emulator on the VM system).

  Adacom

  The IBM 3708.

The program includes code to use the 3708, but it apparently does not work.
Since sources are provided, customers are encouraged to make fixes, add support
for additional protocol converters, and send their work back to us for further
distribution.

Models not mentioned above may or may not work with Kermit; we just have not
had any feedback about them.
