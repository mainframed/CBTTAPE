0 Other PAJCBT files space requirements :
  ---------------------------------------
    Assuming that the space for the data-sets is based on a 3380 disk
    type (1 cyl. = 15 tracks), the real needs are :
    ->.SOURCE.FILE0 : 136 dir. blocks used for 820 members with a total
                      space of 186 tracks (12 cylinders and 6 tracks).
    ->.SOURCE.FILE1 : 16 dir. blocks used for 90 members with a total
                      space of 98 tracks (6 cylinders and 8 tracks).
    ->.SOURCE.FILE2 : 35 dir. blocks used for 205 members with a total
                      space of 132 tracks (8 cylinders and 12 tracks).
    ->.SOURCE.FILE3 : 8 dir. blocks used for 44 members with a total
                      space of 96 tracks (6 cylinders and 6 tracks).
    ->.SOURCE.FILE4 : 25 dir. blocks used for 147 members with a total
                      space of 201 tracks (13 cylinders and 6 tracks).
    ->.SOURCE.FILE5 : 12 dir. blocks used for 71 members with a total
                      space of 38 tracks (2 cylinders and 8 tracks).
0 Other members in this data-set :

    JCL      : a job to restore my files ->.SOURCE.FILE0/1/2/3/4/5.
    CBTF0    : abstract of ->.SOURCE.FILE0        | These members
    CBTF1    : abstract of ->.SOURCE.FILE1        |   can be used
    CBTF2    : abstract of ->.SOURCE.FILE2        |     as abstracts
    CBTF3    : abstract of ->.SOURCE.FILE3        |       for the

    CBTF5    : abstract of ->.SOURCE.FILE5        |           file 1.
    $$$$DELE : list of deletions. This member is to be moved in the
               ->.SOURCE.FILE0 data-set in case files 5 (Demo/Games)
               and 6 (CBT extracted) are deleted from the CBT tape.
