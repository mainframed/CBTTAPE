   This service facility is designed to facilitate the CA-LIBRARIAN LIB/CCF
   logout of modules for a new application system that does not already
   exist in the PROD Librarian Master datasets.
   A LIB/CCF LOGOUT "must" be performed for each module to be processed by
   a subsequent LOGIN for movement into the PROD Librarian Master datasets.
   The following requirements must be met in order to utilize this utility:
   1. A Change Request Workorder ( CR/WO ) must be generated via the LIB/CCF
      CCFOpen - OPEN  ( open a change request ).
   2. The CR/WO ) must be assigned to a programmer via the LIB/CCF option 2
      CCFAssign  ( assign a change request ).
   A panel will be presented to supply the following information:
   1. The CR/WO number from the LIB/CCF OPEN change request processing.
   2. The application system to which the modules belong.
   3. Module abstract for history information.
   A panel will be presented to select by module langcode type and supply
   the module names associated with the CR/WO.
   After keying required information from the displayed panel:
   1. depress the ENTER KEY or keyboard equivalent.
   2. depress the PF3 KEY or keyboard equivalent.
