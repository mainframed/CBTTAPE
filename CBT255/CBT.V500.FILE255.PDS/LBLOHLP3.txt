¬
¬  The LCDF ( Library Chain Definition ) corresponds to the numbers used in the
¬  CCF LOGOUT panels presented with the CCFLO command facility.
¬
¬  Only 1 LANGCODE and LCDF can be specified for the modules from the selection
¬  panel. This facility will issue a message to acknowledge the acceptance of
¬  LOGOUT parameters - depress the "ENTER KEY" to continue processing.
¬  This facility will loop and present the selection panels again, so that the
¬  next LANGCODE, LCDF, and module names can be specified.
¬  After all entries are complete, depress the PF3 key to terminate the loop
¬  and submit the logout job for processing CLASS=P on the SYSA system.
¬
¬  A batch job will be submitted to invoke the LIB/CCF batch utility program
¬  ( $CCFB102 ) to perform the CCF LOGOUT.
¬  The job name will be the CR/WO number and should be reviewed via SDSF from
¬  the JES2 HELD output queue.
