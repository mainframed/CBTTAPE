   This service facility is designed to facilitate the ALLOCATION/FORMATTING/
   COPYING/RE-CATALOGING of a "EXISTING" Librarian Master dataset.

   The resulting job that gets submitted, via ISPF dialog skeleton JCL, will
   be submitted to the SYSA production system with initiator CLASS=S.

   It is important to note that any Librarian Master specified for re-allocation
   "MUST" not be in use or enqueued by any TSO user, JOB, or Started Task.
   The jobstream will not complete successfully if an enqueue exists, because
   the first jobstep "RENAME1" attempts to perform an IDCAMS ALTER/RENAME of
   the original Master dataset.

   All jobsteps should complete with a Condition Code of "0".

$  After entering required screen fields data, DEPRESS the ENTER KEY
   to SUBMIT the job to SYSA.
