)F FUNCTION -
   THE COPYSDS COMMAND COPIES A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET TO ANOTHER
   SEQUENTIAL DATA SET.

   IT CAN ALSO COPY A MEMBER OF A PDS, BUT WHEN COPYING ONE MEMBER
   TO ANOTHER THE DIRECTORY INFORMATION IS NOT COPIED, SO A LOAD
   MODULE COPIED WITH THIS COMMAND WOULD NOT BE EXECUTABLE.
   SEE THE COPYPDS COMMAND FOR COPYING ONE OR MORE MEMBERS FROM ONE
   PDS TO ANOTHER.

   BOTH DATA SETS MUST EXIST BEFOREHAND UNLESS THE 'CSPACE(N)'
   KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED. A NEW DATA SET WILL NOT BE CREATED UNLESS THE
   'CSPACE(N)' KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED AND THE DATA SET DOES NOT EXIST.
)X SYNTAX -
     COPYSDS  'DSNAME1'  'DSNAME2'  NUM/NONUM  FILE Q
                IUNIT('UNIT NAME') IVOLUME('INPUT VOLSER')
                OUNIT('UNIT NAME') OVOLUME('OUTPUT VOLSER')
                MAX('NUMBER')  BYPASS('NUMBER')  COUNT  OLD/SHR/MOD
                CSPACE('NUMBER') TRK/CYL

     REQUIRED -  'DSNAME1'  'DSNAME2'
     ALIAS    -  NONE
     DEFAULTS -  NONUM
)O OPERANDS -
))'DSNAME1' - THE NAME OF THE DATA SET TO BE COPIED.
))'DSNAME2' - THE NAME OF THE DATA SET TO RECEIVE THE COPY.
))FILE      - THIS KEYWORD INDICATES THAT THE FIRST 2 OPERANDS
              ARE FILENAMES (DDNAMES), NOT DATA SET NAMES.
))IUNIT     - UNIT OF INPUT DATASET
))IVOLUME   - VOLUME SERIAL OF INPUT VOLUME
))OUNIT     - UNIT OF OUTPUT DATASET
))OVOLUME   - VOLUME SERIAL OF OUTPUT VOLUME
))NUM       - SEQUENCE NUMBERS ARE PRESENT
))NONUM     - SEQUENCE NUMBERS ARE NOT PRESENT OR ARE TO BE TREATED
              AS IF THEY ARE DATA.
))MAX('NUMBER') - THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RECORDS TO COPY.
))BYPASS('NUMBER') - NUMBER OF INPUT RECORDS TO SKIP BEFORE COPYING.
))CSPACE('NUMBER') - NUMBER OF TRACKS OR CYLINDERS TO ALLOCATE.
))TRK       - CSPACE UNITS ARE TRACKS (DEFAULT).
))CYL       - CSPACE UNITS ARE CYLINDERS.
))COUNT     - DISPLAY THE COUNT OF RECORDS COPIED.
))OLD       - THE OUTPUT DATA SET WILL BE ALLOCATED OLD.
              THIS KEYWORD IS IGNORED IF 'FILE' IS SPECIFIED.
))MOD       - THE OUTPUT DATA SET WILL BE ALLOCATED MOD (APPEND).
              THIS KEYWORD IS IGNORED IF 'FILE' IS SPECIFIED.
))SHR       - THE OUTPUT DATA SET WILL BE ALLOCATED SHR.
              YOU RISK UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS IF ANOTHER JOB OR USER
              IS USING THE DATA SET AT THE SAME TIME.
              THIS KEYWORD IS IGNORED IF 'FILE' IS SPECIFIED.
))Q         - THE INPUT DATASET IS FULLY QUALIFIED AND USER WILL
              NOT BE PROMPTED TO COMPLETE IT (DEFAULT).
))NQ        - THE INPUT DATASET MIGHT NOT BE FULLY QUALIFIED
              AND USER MIGHT BE PROMPTED TO PROVIDE THE LAST QUALIFIER.
