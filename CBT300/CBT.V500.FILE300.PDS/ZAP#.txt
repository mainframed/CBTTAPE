)F FUNCTION
   The ZAP command is used to examine, dump, and modify any type of
   sequential, partitioned, or direct access dataset.
   Any RECFM is accepted. This command is the TSO interactive
   equivalent of IBM's service aid 'IMASPZAP' or 'SUPERZAP'
)X SYNTAX
     ZAP 'dsname' VOLUME('serial') UNIT('uname') CRT NOT3270
         TERSE/VERBOSE BLKSIZE('blksize')
         NOLOG/LOG
         FULLVOL
   REQUIRED: 'dsname'
   DEFAULTS:  TERSE, NOLOG
              No volume implies a cataloged dataset.
   NOTE:  VOLUME keyword is required if dataset is not cataloged or if
          it is 'FORMAT4.DSCB'.
)O OPERANDS
))'dsname' - The name of the dataset to be ZAP'd.
))VOLUME   - The volume serial on which the dataset resides. The volume
             must be online and resident or storage.
))BLKSIZE  - If the dataset to be zapped has blocks larger than the
             blocksize value in the VTOC, use this parameter to
             specify an alternate and overriding value.
))CRT      - Conditions ZAP to display four lines on either side of the
             current position in the file.
))NOT3270  - Inhibits use of full screen display mode on a 3270-type
             terminal and implies line by line display mode.
))UNIT     - Specifies the UNIT in the allocation.
))LOG      - Conditions ZAP to log to SYSOUT all ZAP transactions to
             the file. Note that ZAP may be put in the logging state
             after it has been entered by use of the LOG  command, and
             that use of any of the DUMP commands causes ZAP to
             automatically enter the logging state.
             The log goes to SYSOUT(A) unless ddname 'ZAPLOG' is
             pre-allocated to wherever you want it to go.
))NOLOG    - Suppress the hardcopy log.
))TERSE /VERBOSE -
             Conditions ZAP to omit the positional 'WHERE'
             information when displaying a portion of the file.
))VERBOSE /TERSE -
             Conditions ZAP to give the positional 'WHERE'
             information when displaying a portion of the file.
))FULLVOL  - Implies that this will be a full volume ZAP session,
             and not just for an individual data set.  Note that
             this operand requires VTOC update privilege.
