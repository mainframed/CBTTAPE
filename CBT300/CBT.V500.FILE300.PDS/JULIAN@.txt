This is the information as per out previous communication.
I labeled the lines of code I changed or added.  If there
are any questions, please contact me at
scpeckham@modempool.com

What I corrected was the assumption that all dates are in
the range 1900-1999.

Now 2 digit years will be assumed to be in the current
century, and 4 digit years are allowed in any of the 3
original input formats.  Formats originally accepted
were MM/DD/YY, YY.DDD, YYDDD, and noparm.  Added are
MM/DD/YYYY, YYYYDDD, and YYYY.DDD .  Most of the
underlying code already used 4 digit years, which made
a complete re-write unnecessary.
