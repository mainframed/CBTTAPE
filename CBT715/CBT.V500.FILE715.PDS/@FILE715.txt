//***FILE 715 is a revival of the Tape Erase program that used to   *   FILE 715
//*           be on File 370 of the CBT Tape Version 249 from July  *   FILE 715
//*           1985.  This is an old program from the Federal Bank   *   FILE 715
//*           of (West) Germany from the very early 1980s.          *   FILE 715
//*                                                                 *   FILE 715
//*       Questions or problems about this program should be        *   FILE 715
//*       directed to Sam Golob:   sbgolob@cbttape.org              *   FILE 715

//*       Two versions of this program are presented.  The first    *   FILE 715
//*       is called DSE, and the second, for MVS systems that are   *   FILE 715
//*       too primitive to have the OPEN with EXTEND option, is     *   FILE 715
//*       called DSEALT.  The original two programs and instruc-    *   FILE 715
//*       tions are presented unchanged, as member DSEORIG.         *   FILE 715
//*                                                                 *   FILE 715
//*       Modern assembly-linkedit JCL is member DSE$, and some     *   FILE 715
//*       sample run JCL is presented as member DSE@.  Below is     *   FILE 715
//*       the original description of the program from CBT Tape     *   FILE 715
//*       File 001, with only the German spelling of the word       *   FILE 715
//*       "programm" changed to the spelling "program".             *   FILE 715

//*          GIVEN DATASET UNTIL IT REACHES THE REFLECTIVE          *   FILE 715

//*          WITH THIS PROGRAM YOU CAN ERASE BOTH SL AND            *   FILE 715
