0                         Sequential Copy Utility (SEQCOPY)
-
        SEQCOPY is a utility program designed to quickly copy one sequential
        data set (or PDS member) to another.  This program offers the
        following advantages over IEBGENER, the IBM utility designed to
        perform the same function:
0         .  SEQCOPY uses 40 to 60 % less CPU time than IEBGENER.
0         .  SEQCOPY can be used to change the record format or record length
             of a data set.  (Records are truncated or padded with blanks as
             necessary.)
0         .  SEQCOPY prints the number of records copied so that correct
             operation can be verified easily.
0         .  SEQCOPY allows recovery from input errors by use of the EROPT
             suboperand of the DCB operand.
0         .  SEQCOPY accepts concatenated data sets on different device types
             (such as cards and disk) as input.
0       The following features of IEBGENER are not supported by SEQCOPY:
+                                              ___
0         .  Partitioned output, input editing, and other functions requested
             by IEBGENER control statements.
0         .  Copying keyed data sets.
0         .  Copying LRECL=X data sets.
0       Note that neither IEBGENER nor SEQCOPY may be used to copy load
        modules.
0       SEQCOPY was developed at Baylor College of Medicine and is supported
        as class C1 software (i.e., consulting is available but no maintenance
        is provided).  See ICSA Document UTL013.002 for further information on
        IEBGENER.
-       USAGE
0       The cataloged procedure named SEQCOPY may be used to run the
        sequential copy utility.  A listing of this procedure is available for
        reference in the User Clinic.  The Job Control Language (JCL)
        available at ICSA is described in ICSA Document GEN001.  The JCL below
        shows all the DD cards that the user might need to include when using
        SEQCOPY.  When these cards are included, they must be in the same
        order as shown.

0       A SETUP card is required for each tape or off-line disk volume used.
                  See ICSA Document GEN001 for the format of this card.
0       The SYSUT1 DD card must be provided to define the input file.  The DCB
                  suboperands RECFM, LRECL and BLKSIZE must be provided on the
                  DD statement for an input data set on an unlabeled tape.
0       The SYSUT2 DD card must be provided to define the output file.  If DCB
                  suboperands are not available from the label of an existing
                  data set, and are not provided on the DD card, they will be
