      This is a collection of utilities, macros, TSO commands, usermods, and
      other stuff from Rice University.  We run MVS/SP 1.1.1 with base-level
      JES2 (EJE1102),  and all of this is  working at that level.   (We also
      run UICC's JTIP and ACF2, which are occasionally referenced.  We think
      we have removed all serious dependencies on these products.)
0     Some of this is updated/corrected versions  of stuff we originally got
      from the 1-23-82 version of the mods  tape.   Therefore some of it may
      have  been superseded  or complicated  by  other changes  to the  same
      programs since then.

0     This collection includes:
0          TAPESCAN, a tape scanning/copying utility especially suited to
+       ®
           diagnosis of over-written or otherwise screwed-up tapes.  This
           version of  TAPESCAN  includes  extensive  support  for  ANSI-
           labelled  tapes,  and  a lot  of  security support  (including
           password, expiration date and ACF2 security checking).
0          DISKUTIL, an IEHPROGM replacement.
+       ®
0          SEQCOPY, an IEBGENER replacement.
+       ®
0          PRINTPDS,  a utility to print all members of a PDS,  no matter
+       ®
           what record format.    It produces a table of  contents and an
           alias cross-reference.
0          MAPDISK,  another VTOC mapping utility (unrelated to others of
+       ®
           the same name).
0          A version of dynamic MLPA (or MODREP)  with some horrible bugs
+       ®
           fixed.   (Now we know why it stopped working when we installed
           low-memory protection!)
0          CLUTSPAR,  a friendlier version of IKJPARS.   Try it,  and you
+       ®
           won't want to  go back!   Note that CLUTSPAR  does not support
           any TSO/E  features such  as the PARSE  interface to  the HELP
           command,   due  to  lack  of information  on  how  they  work.
           (CLUTSPAR is a fragment of a project called TSU, which started
           out as a mechanism for writing TSO command processors in PL/I,
           and  eventually sprouted  replacements for  major portions  of
           TSO.   TSU as  a whole has never quite become  clean enough to
           release, but CLUTSPAR is such an enormous improvement over the
           competition that we decided to make it an exception.)
0          The Language Independent  Environment (LIE),  a set  of macros
+       ®
           and routines to let you  write assembler subroutines which can
           take advantage  of services of  the PL/I environment,   plus a
           pseudo-PL/I  environment manufacturer,   to  provide the  same
           services in the  absence of PL/I.   CLUTSPAR  is a pseudo-PL/I
           application in this sense.
0          The XSEND TSO command, for improved communication with logged-
+       ®
           on TSO users.   Now you can send with WAIT and break out of it
           if you get  tired of waiting!   XSEND includes a  user SVC for
           controlled use  of TPUT HIGHP (to  send bells/alarm to  tell a
           NOINTERCOM user someone wants to "speak" to him).
0          LISTM, a nice TSO command to list PDS member names.
+       ®
0          LISTU,   a nice  TSO  command to  list  TSO  users (sorted  by
+       ®
           userid).
0          UPUT, UPROMPT and UGET, macros to use as replacements for TPUT
+       ®
           and  TGET   that  interface  to  the   PUTLINE/PUTGET  service
           routines.  They make conversion of old TSO code so it will run
           under a batch TMP much easier.

0          XWTO,  a macro to allow WTO messages to be built from segments
+       ®
           without having to compute all the offsets.
0          UHB macros,  a set of utility macros to make writing big macro
+       ®
           applications (like XWTO turned out to be) much easier.
0          A JULIAN routine (originally written  to be called from COBOL)
+       ®
           to convert dates between Julian  and Gregorian format,  and to
           determine the day of the week.    This routine is not all that
           interesting, but it is used by some of the other submissions.
0          SAVEX and RETURNX macros,  yet  another example of an extended
+       ®
           SAVE and RETURN.   Again,  not that interesting,  but used all
           over by our other code.
0     The  above  are   (except  for  the  XSEND  SVC   and  CLUTSPAR)   all
      applications, and require  no SMP work.    We are also  providing SMP-
      packaged SYSMODS to support:
0          A modification to the JES2 $DF  command to allow selections of
+       ®
           the  types of  data  sets to  be  displayed.    This mod  also
           introduces  the $XF  command,  which  displays  each job  with
           output of the specified kind.
0          A big mod  to JES2 output processing to provide  counts of the
+       ®
           actual number of pages printed for a job, based on definitions
           of  forms and  carriage  tape layouts  contained  in the  JES2
           initialization parameters.
0          A mod to  TSO functional accounting (SMF type  32 records)  to
+       ®
           record response-time-related  information in place of  some of
           the more esoteric  present information,  and to  not require a
           pre-assembled list  of interesting  commands.   Included  is a
           report program to  summarize the records contained  in a batch
           of SMF data.
0          A version of the mod to add  the maximum condition code to the
+       ®
           JES2 NOTIFY message.
0          A  JES2 mod  to  display the  converter  ABEND  code when  the
+       ®
           converter crashes.   (Now who would ever  want to know a thing
           like that?)
0          A mod  to remove "CN(00)"  from NOTIFY messages  (and anything
+       ®
           else sent via internal SEND commands).
0          A mod  to stamp  a new format  1 DSCB with  the userid  of its
+       ®
           creator (from the SMF userid field).  With ACF2 (and the right
           ACF2 options), this will be the ACF2 logonid.
