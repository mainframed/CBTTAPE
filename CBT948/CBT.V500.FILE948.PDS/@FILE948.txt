//*     This Rexx is inspired from Rexx program MEMU provided       *   FILE 948
//*     by IBM. It starts a Monitor trace and reads the buffer      *   FILE 948
//*     returned. In this Rexx I read IFCID401 which is called      *   FILE 948
//*     "Static Statement Cache".  The data returned can be         *   FILE 948
//*     used in different ways.                                     *   FILE 948
//*                                                                 *   FILE 948
//*     IFCID 401 is mapped using a "varying length repeating       *   FILE 948
//*     group", so the processing is different than IFCID 225       *   FILE 948
//*     (easier) which is read by MEMU for example.                 *   FILE 948
//*                                                                 *   FILE 948
//*     The data returned is really huge so you should filter       *   FILE 948
//*     directly from the REXX or by qualifying your READS          *   FILE 948
//*     request. Time is GMT (I think) so don't be surprised.       *   FILE 948
//*                                                                 *   FILE 948
//*     PDS2SEQ - A REXX program to put a PDS into sequential       *   FILE 948

//*                                                                 *   FILE 948
//*     I use my PC as a "data store", where I have anything        *   FILE 948
//*     on it (Manuals, Redbooks, documents, presentations          *   FILE 948
//*     ...). And with the help of a search software                *   FILE 948
//*     (Archivarius seems to be the best search software that      *   FILE 948
//*     I've found after many tests), I am able to find             *   FILE 948
//*     anything on my PC (A sort of Google search on my PC).       *   FILE 948
//*                                                                 *   FILE 948
//*     So, it is interesting for me to be able to retrieve         *   FILE 948
//*     data that are on PDS from my search software.  This         *   FILE 948
//*     Rexx reads a PDS, puts it in a sequential format , so       *   FILE 948
//*     I can ftp it on my PC. It provides also jcl that you        *   FILE 948
//*     can use to reload the sequential into a PDS format.         *   FILE 948
//*                                                                 *   FILE 948
//*     It is adapted from a Rexx that I've found on the web        *   FILE 948
