:h1.Introduction
.sp 3
:p.The System Library Subscription Service (SLSS)
is an interactive dialog application that you can use to
aid in creating and maintaining a library.  SLSS may be used
to support an individual library or several libraries which can
be accessed by single or multiple users.
.sp
:p.The term library is used to define a collection of manuals.
The library will contain for each manual, ID, title, order
status, location (were filed), updates, program number(s), keyswords
and audit information.
:h3.Major Functions
.sp
:i1.browse
:i1.edit
:i1.scan
:i1.sort
:i1.print
:i1.delete
:i1.create
:i1.reset
:i1.utility
:i1.authorize
:p.SLSS is an ISPF dialog that you use at a display terminal.
The functions available to you include:
.sp 2
:ul.
:li.BROWSE existing libraries.
:li.EDIT existing libraries.
:li.CREATE new libraries.
:li.DELETE entire library or selected entries within a library.
:li.PRINT listing of manuals in the library or manuals on order.
:li.SORT library either in Manual ID, location or title sequence.
:li.AUTHORIZE users to browse and/or edit library.
:li.UTILITY to maintain library owner and location.
:li.RESET library and related files if abnormal termination of the
dialog session occurs.
:li.SCANNING of library by any word contained in the title or
any additional keywords defined.
:li.SCROLLING of data within library within while using the
edit or browse functions.
:li.SPLIT SCREEN capability that allows you to partition the
display screen.  Duplicate session of SLSS are not recommended.
:li.DEBUG capability that allows you to trace the session while in
use.
:eul
:h3.SLSS Hierarchy
.sp
:i1.browse
:i1.edit
:i1.create
:i1.library administrator
:i1.owner
:p.Internal to SLSS is a hierarchy that controls authority
and access to libraries.  There are four levels of access
within SLSS.
The highest level is assigned to a single user known as the
Library Administrator.  Assigning the administrator is done at
intialization time of SLSS (refer to Intialization for further
information).  The Administrator has the authority to select
any option within SLSS for any library within SLSS.
:p.The second level within SLSS is the Library
Owner.  The owner is assigned at the time the library is created
and can be modified or re-assigned by the owner of library.
:p.The third level is the authority to edit an individual library.
This authority is assigned or modified by the owner of the library.
:p.The fourth level is the
browse authority, and is also assigned or modified by the owner of
the library.

:h1.Interacting with SLSS
.sp 2
:p.This chapter tells you how to begin and end your SLSS session, and
how to use the display screen and terminal keys.
.sp
:p.SLSS can be invoked as a command or as an option from a
selection panel.  Refer to section 'INSTALLATION' on how to
install SLSS as a selectable option from a panel.
:h3.Panel Displays
.sp
:p.SLSS communicates with you through a series of panels.  A PANEL
is a predefined display image that is presented on a display
terminal.  Panels may require a response, and that response is
used to determine the next panel to be displayed on the function
to be performed.  Your responses may be in uppercase or lowercase.
.sp 2
.*===header break================================================
:h3 SLSS Invocation
.sp 1
To invoke SLSS, enter the command "SLSS".
When SLSS is invoked a copy of the library control file is
copied into the user's session.
The user copy of this file is edited to allow
only authorized libraries to be displayed on the 'Library Selection
Panel'.  If the user is not authorized to view any existing
libraries they will be prompted to either create a new library
on terminate the SLSS session.
.sp 1
If the user has been given authorized access to a library within
SLSS the first panel to be
displayed is the primary option menu (Figure 2).  You may select an
option by typing its number or letter in the option field and
pressing the ENTER key; for example:
.sp 1
.fo off
.bf GT10
     OPTION ===> 2
.pf
.fo on
.sp 1
to select the edit option.

This option will rebuild the keyword scan file to be used by primary
Option 'S' (SCAN).  The user is warned when invoking this option
that it could require several minutes to complete.  The reason for
this is that the Manual Title(s) and Keywords fields are
parsed and each word is placed
in the keyword file along with the Manual ID.  The value of
a space is used as the delimiter when the fields are parsed.

If the owner ID is modified that person and the administrator

:i1.scan
:i1.utility
:p.The scan option allows a user to scan a pre-built keyword file
(utility option 3.2) and scan for a unique or partial word.
This option is intended to aid the user in locating manuals
for a subject or topic without knowing the Manual ID.
The user supplies a keyword to be scanned for.  If a partial
keyword is to be entered an asterisk '*' should be the last
character in the word.  The file is searched using the
keyword and the user notified of any matches found and the
Manual ID's.  The user then has an option of viewing the titles
of all manuals found or continuing.  If a partial keyword was
entered the search continues and the process repeated if any
further matches are found.

:p.Internally to SLSS three new members will be created and
added to the output table library (ISPTABL) each time a new
library is created.  The library
name entered will be used to create a member that contains the
actual library information.  The library name will then be used to
create two additional members (name.ENQ and name.SCAN).  The 'ENQ'
member is used to control access to the library while another user is
editing the library and the 'SCAN' member is used to build and
maintain the keyword scan file used for option S (SCAN)'

:p.After executing CLIST 'SLSSINIT' the control file and the
library administrator entries will be saved in the output table file
as members 'SLSSCNTL' and 'SLSSADMN'.  The output table library
name is stored in the 'SLSSADMN' member.  This table is opened
each time SLSS is invoked to obtain the output table name and used
to allocate the output DDNAME 'ISPTABL' in the CLIST 'SLSS'.
.sp

:h3.Invoking SLSS
.sp
:p.SLSS may be invoked as a CLIST by entering the 'SLSS' value as
a command.  This requires that the command exist in a library
in the data sets allocated to SYSPROC DDNAME.
.sp
:p.SLSS may also be invoked as a selectable option from a menu.
The following data should be added to a selection menu to allow
SLSS to be a selected option.
.sp
.ce Add the following to the BODY section of the panel:
.sp
.bf GT12
.fo off
  %   S +SLSS        - System library subscription service
.sp
.pf
.fo on
.ce Add the following to the INIT section of the panel:
.sp
.bf GT12
.fo off
                S,'CMD(%SLSS)'
.pf
.fo on

.*
.sp
:h3.Modifications
.sp
:p.The CLIST that is invoked when the 'SLSS' command is entered can
be modified to contain a department or individual name to be used
in error messages.  The variable 'TECHCONT' within CLIST 'SLSS'
at tag 'SETTECH' should be modified.
It is recommended that the following format
be used:
.sp
.ce  SET &TECHCONT = &STR( place name here)
.sp
this value will then be used.  The default value is 'Tech Services'.
