+ This option will scan the SYSLOG and produce a report to the screen that
+ will provide the date/time range that is encompassed for the current week.
+ The information provided by this report is also provided in the various
+ other SYSLOG SEARCH reports.  This option is provided solely as a quick
+ method of determining the range of the current week's SYSLOG without
+ having to generate an actual search jobstream.
+
+
% Note:+ If the SYSLOG data being searched contains only one day's data, the
+        LOW Date/Time will equal the HIGH Date/Time.  This false report
+        condition can be ignored.  It is the exception, not the rule.
