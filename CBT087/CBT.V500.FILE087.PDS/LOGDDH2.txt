%---------------   DETAILS: DAILY SYSLOG DUMPING      -----------------
%
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD             +
+
+  THE SYSLOG is dumped to online storage via JES2 automatic commands
+ on an hourly basis.  These commands are initialized by the 'S LOGCMDS'
+ command (which is part of the IPL procedure). They can also be entered
+ manually  any time the SYSLOG is needed for immediate access/viewing.
+ Note that manually entering the four commands needed to force an immediate
+ SYSLOG dump will not affect the automatic commands schedule.
+
+ SYS1.PROCLIB(LOGCMDS) routes to the  internal reader the JES2 auto-
+ matic commands contained in ABL.CNTL(LOGCMDS). These commands are:
+
+ /*$TA DLOG,T=23.00,I=3600,'$VS,''D T'''       -displays date/time for ref.
+ /*$TA WLOG,T=23.00,I=3600,'$VS,''W T'''       -writes SYSLOG to class T
+ /*$TA SLOG,T=23.01,I=3600,'$VS,''S SYSLOGD.LOG''' -dumps to online dataset
+ /*$TA PLOG,T=23.03,I=3600,'$VS,''P LOG'''     -pauses external writer
+
+ Refer to the JES2 Operator Commands manual for details regarding the
+ use of automatic commands.
