+
+ The SYSLOG is written to sysout class "T" in two different ways:
+
+  1. It is automatically written to sysout by the system each time
+     the buffer which holds the SYSLOG data fills up.   The buffer
+     limit is controlled in Sys1.Parmlib(IEASYS00) entry "LOGLMT=".
+     It is currently set to 5000 (6/84).  Each time the SYSLOG buf-
+     fer reaches the 5000 line limit, the system automatically will
+     write the buffer to sysout class "T".
+
+  2. The SYSLOG can also be spooled to sysout class "T" anytime it
+     is desired to be dumped by manually entering the command "W T".
+     The active log can also be printed immediately via the "W A"
+     command.  This will print the current SYSLOG in class 'A'.
+
+  Regardless of how the SYSLOG is spooled to sysout class "T",
+  (either automatically by the system or via manual operator command
+  'W T'),    the message "A SYSLOG DATASET HAS BEEN SPOOLED TO SYSOUT
+  CLASS T" will always be produced.   This means that the SYSLOG
+  data is now in a regular JES2 sysout print class and is ready to
+  either be printed (via printer setup to class "T") or dumped
+  to disk for future use.  Dumping the SYSLOG to disk allows for
+  the use of a utility program which can scan and selectively print
+  a given time period or literal data. Use SPF option 3.S to access
+  the retained SYSLOG.
