%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD             +
+
+  Once the SYSLOG data is spooled to sysout class "T",  enter the
+  following command:  S SYSLOGD.LOG  .  This task will add the current
+  SYSLOG data to an online file each time it is run.  Note that the
+  SYSLOG will not automatically print out each time it is dumped to
+  online storage.  Use ISPF's primary menu option 3.S to access the
+  online SYSLOG.
+
+  After the "SYSLOGD" task copies the SYSLOG from spool to disk,
+  message " LOG WAITING FOR WORK " will appear.  The reply to this
+  message will always be " P LOG " .  This reply will close the disk
+  file (actually the external writer program) and complete the
+  process of dumping (i.e., retaining) the SYSLOG.
+
+  NOTE: ANY problems with this procedure should be addressed as soon
+        possible as the availability of SYSLOG data is critical in
+        emergency situations.
+
+  Refer to the manual 'MVS SPL: JOB Management for details regarding
+  the use of external writers.
