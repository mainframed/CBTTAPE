                NEWSWEEK DOCUMENTATION FOR MVS/370

  WE AT NEWSWEEK HAVE TO RUN MVS/370 BECAUSE OF OUR MACHINE
RESTRICTIONS AND BECAUSE OF RUNNING VM/CMS.  FOR ALL US PEOPLES, I AM
TRYING TO MAINTAIN AND TEST DICK SZIEDE AND CHARLIE PITTS'S WORK ON
THE IO-COUNT ZAP, SO IT WILL ALSO RUN ON MVS/370.  OUR PROGRAMMERS
LOVE THE IO-COUNT ZAP, AND WE WOULDN'T DREAM OF BEING WITHOUT IT.

  RIGHT NOW, I'M INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL MVS/370 ASMTOZAP SOURCE,
CALLED LM02301A, AND AN ACTUAL CODED ZAP PRODUCED BY ASSEMBLY OF THE
SOURCE AND THE ASMTOZAP RUN.  THIS IS A CODED USERMOD THAT WE USE TO
INSTALL THE ZAP ON OUR SYSTEM.  I'VE EDITED IT A BIT TO EXPLAIN IT
BETTER, AND TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE USERMOD.  IF I HAVE TIME AND
ENERGY, I HOPE TO TRY AND RECODE THE MVS/370 VERSION OF THE ZAP TO
INCLUDE CHARLIE PITTS'S IMPROVEMENTS FOR XA.  MUCH THANKS TO DICK
SZIEDE FOR HIS HELP.

  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHOOT THE BREEZE,
OR IF YOU'D LIKE TO PUT THIS MOD IN WITHOUT SMP.  I'LL BE GLAD TO
HELP.
