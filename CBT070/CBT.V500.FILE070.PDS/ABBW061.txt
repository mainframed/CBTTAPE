++ USERMOD(ABBW061) /* INSTALL OUR IEFU84 SMF EXIT:

       THIS MODIFICATION INSTALLS THE IEFU84 SMF EXIT WHICH WILL:

       WHEN A TYPE 40 RECORD IS ENCOUNTERED THEN IF IT IS A DYNAMIC
       UNALLOCATION THEN THE I/O COUNT IS ACCUMULATED IN THE FIRST
       FOUR BYTES IN THE USER SMF WORK AREA.  THIS WORKAREA IS POINT-
       ED TO BY THE JMRUCOM FIELD AND IS ALSO USED BY THE IEFACTRT
       SMF EXIT TO ACCUMULATE DATA FOR JOBS BETWEEN EXITS. THIS AREA
       IS GETMAINED BY THE FIRST EXIT TO NEED IT (IEFU83, IEFU84 OR
       IEFACTRT) AND FREEMAINED (ONLY) BY IEFACTRT WHEN PROCESSING
       A TYPE 05 OR TYPE 35 SMF RECORD.  WHENEVER A TYPE 04 OR 34
       RECORD IS ENCOUNTERED THEN THE TYPE 40 I/O COUNT ACCUMULATION
       IS ADDED TO THE FIRST DISK DEVICE ENTRY IN THAT RECORD. ALL
       TYPE40 RECORDS ARE SUPPRESSED FROM BEING PHYSICALLY WRITTEN
       TO THE SMF DATASETS (THEY ARE STOPPED BY THIS ROUTINE RETURN-
       ING WITH RC=4 BUT THEY MUST BE ENABLED IN THE SMFPRM00 MEMBER
       OF PARMLIB FOR THIS ROUTINE TO EVER SEE THEM).

       THE BASIC REASON FOR DOING ALL THIS IS TO ALLOW FOR THE
       ACCOUNTING ROUTINES TO CORRECTLY CHARGE FOR ALL I/O WITHOUT
       COLLECTING MILLIONS OF TYPE40 RECORDS.

       TAPE I/O IS ADJUSTED TO DISK I/O BY K03/K02 AND THAT CODE
       MUST BE CHANGED IF THE ALGORITHM VALUES CHANGE.  THERE IS
       NO ATTEMPT TO COMPENSATE FOR THE (SLIGHT) DIFFERENCE IN
       I/O TIME USED IN COMPUTING STORAGE OCCUPANCY.

       THIS CODE MUST BE IN BOTH IEFU83 AND IEFU84 TO WORK.

       JCLIN IS REQUIRED ONLY IF UCC7 IS INSTALLED.
