                    What's new in Model 204 ISPF Dialogs


   o  Model 204 Procedure Browse and Edit date sorting is now Year 2000
      ready.  Any year less than or equal to 65 is considered a 20xx date.

   o  Model 204 Procedure Browse/View invokes the browse or view function
      depending on the value of variable ZVIEW.  This variable is set in the
      View Entry Panel (ISPF Option 1) via the "Browse Mode" Option and is
      saved in the ISPF profile.

                    What's new in Model 204 ISPF Dialogs


   o  Model 204 Procedure Browse and Edit member selection lists
      now contain the userid of the last user to update the procedure.
      The selection lists can now be sorted on any field, with the procedure
      name always being the secondary sort key.  This feature is supported
      beginning with version 3.2.0 of Model 204.

      Long procedure names (up to 100 bytes) are now allowed.  Only
      the first 29 characters of the name will appear on the member
      selection list, but you can still edit and save them with no
      problems.

                    What's new in Model 204 ISPF Dialogs


   o  ISPF Edit Recovery is now invoked in the M204EDIT dialog for the
      temporary OUTxxxxn data sets.  Edit recovery on "other" data sets
      in the ISPF Edit Recovery Table is deferred.  If you choose to
      continue to edit the work data set, you must save it in another
      file using an external data command like CREATE, REPLACE, or CUT
      so that you can restore it later in a subsequent ISPF Model 204
      procedure edit session with COPY or PASTE.

                    What's new in Model 204 ISPF Dialogs


   o  Model 204 Procedure Browse and Edit now support the pattern
      matching characters (*=wildcard, +=placeholder, #=numeric
      digit, @=alphabetic) in the procedure name field in order to
      build a member list subset based on a pattern.  This feature
      is supported beginning with version 2.2.0 of Model 204.

                    What's new in Model 204 ISPF Dialogs


   o  Option X on the DICTIONARY menu has been rewritten in MSP's procedure
      language.  The M204P procedure has replaced the M204 executive and
      the FMTM2041-4 translation rules.  Additional functionality (perhaps
      attributes, keys, etc.) will be added at a later date.

                    What's new in Model 204 ISPF Dialogs


   o  Option S on the UTILITY menu has been expanded to prompt for a
      search program name.  Either the SEARCH-FOR utility (IBM option
      3.14) or the CBT TSO mods (file 182) PDS command can be specified.
      If SEARCH-FOR is used, see the 3.14 tutorial for the data string
      optional parameters that can be used (e.g., PREFIX, SUFFIX, WORD,
      and C).

   o  Option L on the UTILITY menu, Browse the Model 204 system change
      logs has been added.  If you are a Model 204 systems programmer,
      you can edit the logs.  Others can only browse the logs to see
      what fixes, JCL changes, file changes, etc. have been made to the
      Model 204 online systems.

   o  Option W, What's new in Model 204 ISPF dialogs has been added
      to the selection menu.

   o  A new edit macro, M204UL, has been developed to show the logic flow
      of all control words in a Model 204 user language program.  To run,
      enter M204UL at the COMMAND ===> line when using ISPF edit.  All
      labels in columns 1-20 and the following control words are shown:

        BEGIN    CALL     ELSE     ELSEIF    END      FD         FDR
        FDV      FEO      FIND     FOR       FPC      FR         FRN
        FRV      IF       INCLUDE  JUMP      MORE     PROCEDURE  REPEAT
        RETURN   THEN

                    What's new in Model 204 ISPF Dialogs


   o  The Model 204 Option Menu has been split up with the addition of
      2 new selection menu branches, DICTIONARY functions and UTILITY
      functions.

   o  Option P, Display/set dialog profile has been added to the selection
      menu.  Dialog profile variables for Model 204 load and cram libraries
      can be set which will be used in dialog calls and batch JCL creation.

   o  Option U, Compute Model 204 server size from UTABLE values has been
      added to the UTILITY menu.

   o  The use data set continuation card column has been changed to 74 in
      the Model 204 Edit/Browse options.  This was done to enable file
      create procedures (from Dictionary/204) to be copied to 80-byte
      length PDS members without having them truncated.

   o  The M204I initial edit macro deletes all "continuation-only" lines
      ('- ' in first two columns).  These extra continuation lines are a
      result of re-editing a file create procedure that already has
      continuation characters in column 74.

   o  Model 204 Procedure Browse and Edit are now even more SPF-like when
      locating a member from the selection list.  A locate match positions
      the table on the member name.  A locate miss positions the table on
      the member above the greater than member match.

                    What's new in Model 204 ISPF Dialogs


   o  Model 204 Procedure Browse and Edit are now more SPF-like when displaying
      the member selection list.  A new primary SORT command has been added to
      avoid excessive "new-lining" over the old panel sort fields in order to
      select a member.  The member selection list is now re-positioned to where
      it last was after return from edit or browse.  When selecting existing
      procedures for edit, the cursor is now placed at the COMMAND line instead
      of on the word PROCEDURE when entering ISPF Edit.  The OUTxxxxn file
      name now has the ISPF logical screen number appended to the name in order
      to invoke Model 204 Edit/Browse on both sides of the screen without
      introducing file name conflicts.  ISPF edit recovery is now set ON in the
      initial edit macro to enable recovery of the temporary userid.OUTxxxxn
      data set in the case of system crash or terminal time out.

   o  Option T now renamed to option X (EXPORT).

   o  Option I, Import file definition from Dictionary/204 to DATAMANAGER has
      been added.

   o  Option D, Validate Model 204 file definition in DATAMANAGER dictionary
      has been added.

   o  Miscellaneous notes about Model 204 Edit has been added to the tutorial.

   o  Option M, TSO foreground connection to M204 multi-user now puts terminal
      in line mode so *** appears when screen is full.  The PA1 key can not
      be used to attention/break or kill command output when using this option.
