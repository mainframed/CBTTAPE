                     M204 ISPF Dialog Installation

  General:

   o  Copy clists into a SYSPROC library, ISPF panels into a ISPPLIB
      library, the ISPF message into a ISPMLIB library, and ISPF
      skeletons into a ISPSLIB.

   o  Tailor the profile panel, M204PROF, to reflect your data set naming
      conventions for loadlib and cramlib.

   o  Tailor the panels to reflect your default procedure library
      name and channels in variables &M204PROC and &M204CHAN.

   o  Assemble and linkedit TERMID and USERPLIB source.

   o  Hook to panel M204M by including it as an Option on any ISPF
      selection panel.

   o  Allocate ISPFILE to &userid.GEN.CNTL in a start-up clist
      during TSO Logon.  JCL skeletons are written to this data set.
      If another data set name is used, tailor M204DMx/M204UTx clists
      to edit on that data set.

  M204EDIT clist notes:

   o  Tailor the REPRO (procedure backup) in the M204EDIT clist to copy
      to your own PDS.  We use a PDS named M204.M204EDIT.REPRO which is
      shared by all M204EDIT users.  The member naming convention
      is Mjjjhhmm, where jjj = julian days, and hhmm = hours and minutes.
      The possibility exists for duplicate Mjjjhhmm members overlaying
      each other, but a tool such as the TSO PDS command can restore any
      updated or deleted member if you should ever need to recover.
      Since the connection to Model 204 is so loose (when calling BATCH2
      from TSO you never know if the update will complete because of
      enqueues, no space conditions, etc.) we took the REPRO route to
      save significant work that was saved in ISPF edit to the OUTxxxxn
      temporary data set (which is temporary backup until you edit the
      next procedure).  Because of the loose connection, I recommend
      you route the Model 204 output messages back to the terminal so
      you can see if the procedure update completes without error.

  TERMID notes:

   o  The purpose of TERMID is to generate a unique OUTxxxxn filename
      for each user.  The last four positions of the terminal identifier
      in the ACEE is used for xxxx.  The ISPF logical screen id is used
      for n.  Non-unique filenames cause enqueue conflicts between users.

                      |        MISCELLANEOUS HELP       |
                      -----------------------------------

    The following miscellaneous items are not in any special order. They
    are intended to be reviewed by the M204EDIT user who wants to fully utilize
    all of the capabilities of M204EDIT, who has a good understanding of
    M204EDIT, and who has some experience using it.  If a given item is not
    meaningful it should be ignored.

 o  Model 204 User Language Procedures reside in Table D on a given Model 204
    file.  ISPF edit (option 2 on primary option menu) can only update OS
    sequential or partitioned data sets.  Thus, it is necessary to import
    the Model 204 procedure into a temporary work data set (OUTxxxxn, where
    xxxx is the VTAM termid and n is the ISPF logical screen number) so that
    ISPF edit can do what you paid it to do - be THE professional programmer's
    editor with a robust set of commands and a complete online tutorial.

 M204T01B ---------- M204EDIT - MISCELLANEOUS HELP - 1 ---------------- TUTORIAL
 COMMAND ===>

 o  The import is accomplished by a DISPLAY PROC (LABEL) NAME command which
    BATCH2 sends to the Model 204 region using the Cross Region Access Method.
    The export (or save) of the procedure back to the Model 204 file is done
    by invoking BATCH2 and framing the procedure code with PROCEDURE NAME and
    END PROCEDURE delimiters.  For various reasons, this does not always result
    in a successful save.  For example, a procedure that is in use can not be
    saved and updated.  Therefore, an additional measure of backup is taken
    using the TSO REPRO command before BATCH2 is invoked for the save back.

 o  The user language procedure is REPROed to a PDS named M204.M204EDIT.REPRO.
    The member naming convention (remember only 8 bytes to work with in PDS')
    is Mjjjhhmm, where jjj = julian days, and hhmm = hours and minutes.  The
    possibility exists for duplicate Mjjjhhmm members overlaying each other if
    2 or more M204EDIT users are pressing the END key during the same minute.
    But a tool such as the TSO PDS command (option P on the AMXSI-TRI primary
    option menu) can restore any updated or deleted member if you should ever
    need that level of recovery.

 M204T01C ---------- M204EDIT - MISCELLANEOUS HELP - 2 ---------------- TUTORIAL
 COMMAND ===>

 o  Normally, the OUTxxxxn file is adequate backup for just about any situation
    provided that you have not overwritten it with another procedure edit.

 o  A handy way of quick testing the user language procedure after ISPF edit
    is to "hot-key" to the Model 204 region using a session manager tool
    such as PIE MultiTSO Sessions (an advertising plug for a decent product).
    Then you simply logon (if not done already) to Model 204, open your
    procedure file(s) and include the procedures that you want to test.
    Sounds easy, doesn't it?  Almost as easy as the GO command from the
    "other" editor.

 o  If you need to look at a procedure while it is in use, then choose the
    browse option from the Model 204 Option Menu.  This option is similar to
    edit, only it does not do the export/save back function which avoids a
    zillion error messages.

 o  All of the ISPF edit features are available such as the AMXSI-TRI edit
    macros CUT and PASTE and the edit external data commands like COPY, CREATE,
    and REPLACE.  A combination of these macros/commands can be used to rapidly
    build new user language procedures from existing code.
