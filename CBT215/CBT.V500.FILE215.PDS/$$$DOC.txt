SMP/E Helper Tools

   This simple collection consists of 2 CLISTs, and 3 articles from
"Technical Support" magazine, showing how to use them.  The CLISTs
are:

      PTF       -  A CLIST to browse PTFs using the REVIEW command
                   from the CBT Tape (File 134).  The "database"
                   containing your PTFs is none other than the
                   SMPPTS dataset.  Therefore, it is advisable not
                   to purge PTFs after you ACCEPT them.  In any
                   case, you can at least look at the ones you have
                   currently.

      SMPCLIST  -  This invokes SMP/E in the foreground as if it
                   were running in background.  You enter background
                   commands on the terminal, and GIMSMP's results
                   are displayed line-by-line, on the terminal.
                   Logging can be turned on or off.  Look at the
                   CLIST to see the options.  I use this CLIST to
                   make certain kinds of inquiries that are not
                   easily made with the SMP/E ISPF interface.  Also,
                   I use this CLIST to do UCLIN interactively, using
                   LIST commands to check my work.

                   Note - This CLIST was originally in VB-Lrecl 255
                          format, and was converted to FB-Lrecl 80
                          format by the clist conversion program on
                          File 187 of the CBT Tape.  Therefore many
                          of the long lines have been folded over.


I have written several articles for "Technical Support" magazine
regarding these CLISTS.  #ARTPTF is an article about the PTF clist.
#ARTSMPC is about the SMPCLIST clist.  #ARTEXMP describes cases
in which both clists were put to practical use.
