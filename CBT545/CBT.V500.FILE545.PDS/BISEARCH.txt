BEGIN  COMMENT -------------------------------------
    AT ENTRY, R0 - R4 MUST BE SET UP AS FOLLOWS:

         R0 = N         NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN POINTER ARRAY
         R1 = LOW       ADDRESS OF FIRST ELEMENT IN POINTER ARRAY
         R2 = DISP      NUMBER OF THE 1ST BYTE OF KEY FIELD
         R3 = L         NUMBER OF BYTES IN THE KEY FIELD
         R4 = AX        ADDRESS OF ITEM X TO FIND IN THE TABLE
         NOTE:          N, DISP, & L ARE ALL NUMBERS >= 1.

    DURING EXECUTION, REGISTERS SET AS ABOVE ALONG WITH:

         R9 = HIGH      ADDRESS OF LAST ELEMENT IN POINTER ARRAY
         R5 = AS        ADDRESS OF THE KEY TO COMPARE WITH X
         R6 = M         ADDRESS OF POINTER TO RECORD WITH KEY 'AS'
         R7 = 4         CONSTANT USED FOR FAST ADDS IN LOOP
         R8 = _4        MASK TO DROP RIGHTMOST 2 BITS

    AT EXIT, R1 IS ADDRESS OF ELEMENT IN POINTER ARRAY FOR
         THE RECORD WITH KEY THAT MATCHES X  (0 IF NO MATCH).

    THIS ROUTINE --
         DOES NOT MODIFY     REGISTERS R10 - R15, R0
         SAVES & RESTORES    REGISTERS R2 - R9
