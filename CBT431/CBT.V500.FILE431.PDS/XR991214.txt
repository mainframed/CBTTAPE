Does anyone know how get a list of rexx variables that have been set?

Thanks, Jon Perryman.

You can write a small asm program to call the rexx service interface
to get them.  If no one has one I'm sure I can dig one up.  I suspect
Gilbert has one somewhere, though.

Here's a program that does it.   (Text of the XRXVARS program follows)

You can't do it from within REXX, but it's fairly simple to write an
assembler routine to extract the names and pass them back to the caller.

Actually, I don't think I do.  There is a REXX exec called VARS in
my file on the CBT tape but it has nothing to do with REXX
variables: it retrieves shared and profile variables from wherever
it can find them in ISPF control blocks.
