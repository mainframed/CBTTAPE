//***FILE 776 is from Edgar Hoffmann and contains a zip file of     *   FILE 776
//*           his version of RECV390 to run on a PC.  Since the     *   FILE 776
//*           sources of his C program are not meant to be run      *   FILE 776
//*           on an MVS machine, unless specially prepared, I have  *   FILE 776
//*           instead left his submission unchanged, as a zip file  *   FILE 776
//*           which was folded into FB, LRECL=80 format for         *   FILE 776
//*           inclusion in this collection.  To use this file,      *   FILE 776
//*           you have to download the RECV390 member, which is     *   FILE 776
//*           a zip file, to a PC, and unzip it there.  Then you    *   FILE 776
//*           can compile the C code, or use the included           *   FILE 776
//*           executable.  Sorry for the non-MVS-ness.  We're in    *   FILE 776
//*           a new age !!  See member $$NOTE1 for further info.    *   FILE 776
