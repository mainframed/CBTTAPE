//***FILE 972 is from Kenneth Tomiak and contains an EDIT macro     *   FILE 972
//*           that mimics the ISPF 'MODEL' command, but GENIE       *   FILE 972
//*           is extensible and serves up WISHes from user          *   FILE 972

//*           If you need help information from a selected group    *   FILE 972
//*           of manuals, you can pull the information into your    *   FILE 972
//*           current ISPF EDIT session.                            *   FILE 972

//*    Unfortunately, Ken has passed on, but he was working up      *   FILE 972

//*    An updated version of this file was found among Ken's        *   FILE 972
//*    materials, which he left.  This is available temporarily     *   FILE 972
//*    on CBT File 978.  I think there's a lot of improvement       *   FILE 972
//*    there, so it's probably worth installing GENIE from          *   FILE 972
//*    File 978 for now.                                            *   FILE 972

//*    Without promising, I will try and update this file later,    *   FILE 972
//*    with Ken's more recent, unpublished materials, once they've  *   FILE 972
//*    been tested.  Meanwhile, you can get them on CBT File 978,   *   FILE 972
