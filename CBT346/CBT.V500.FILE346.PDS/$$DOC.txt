Bob Break's JES2 exits.


    Here are some examples of Bob Break's JES2 exits.

    The following exits are for JES2 6.0.4 (OS/390 Release 2.5):

       HASPEX20,  HASPEX44,  HASP2604 -  Exits 20, 44, 2 respectively

       HASP2520 is Exit 2 for JES2 5.2.0, and is provided, so you
                can see how to convert an exit from JES2 5.2.0 to
                JES2 6.0.4

    Note $$EXIT44 points out a change that has to be made for
       OS/390 Release 2.10.
