In this pds is a REXX from John McKown and sample JCL to run it.
Please change it, as necessary, to run on your system.

As it is a REXX, it is therefore probably easier to modify, than
the original IDCMSGEN assembler program from File 360 which is
more of a pain to modify, because the parsing isn't as good.

For example, if and when you need to show DATACLASS and so forth,
please note the comments in the code, and uncomment them as needed.

Best of everything.
Sam
