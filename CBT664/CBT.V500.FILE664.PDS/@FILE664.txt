//*     In 1998 I, along with most of the rest of the world, was    *   FILE 664
//*     thinking about the approach of the year 2000 and the        *   FILE 664
//*     implications that held for incompatible two digit years.    *   FILE 664
//*     I brought together some routines I had written earlier      *   FILE 664
//*     in several languages (COBOL, BASIC, and Assembler) and      *   FILE 664
//*     the result was this group of Assembler subroutines that     *   FILE 664
//*     can be used to perform any required date format             *   FILE 664
//*     conversion:                                                 *   FILE 664

//*     For several financial applications I had written in the     *   FILE 664
//*     past, I required a date record to be provided from which    *   FILE 664
//*     interest would be calculated either from the prior run      *   FILE 664
//*     date to the current run date or from the current run        *   FILE 664
//*     date forward to the next run date.  I wrote a program       *   FILE 664
//*     that utilized the date routines above to derive such a      *   FILE 664
//*     date record using the current system date and a file of     *   FILE 664
//*     rules to specify the observed holidays:                     *   FILE 664
//*                                                                 *   FILE 664

//*     In addition to the date routines, I wrote a COBOL           *   FILE 664
//*     program to scan source code for likely date references.     *   FILE 664
//*     The program is based upon the design of a BASIC program     *   FILE 664
//*     that was placed in the public domain by the National        *   FILE 664
//*     Institute of Standards.  The program is driven by a         *   FILE 664
//*     glossary table read in at run time.                         *   FILE 664
//*                                                                 *   FILE 664

//*                                                                 *   FILE 664
//*     On this file, there is also an MS/DOS executable, which     *   FILE 664
//*     will calculate the elapsed time between two dates.  This    *   FILE 664
//*     is member ELAPSEXE.  Just download the member to a PC       *   FILE 664
//*     in binary, give it an .exe suffix, and execute it.          *   FILE 664
//*     Equivalent COBOL source to run on the mainframe is          *   FILE 664
//*     included as member ELAPSED.  These programs use the         *   FILE 664
//*     subroutines (or PC equivalents) from the rest of this       *   FILE 664
//*     file.                                                       *   FILE 664
//*                                                                 *   FILE 664
