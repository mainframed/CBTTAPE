*                    TSO HELP FOR 'REVTSO' RELEASE 48.3     AUGUST 2018
)F Function -
  This is the documentation for the TSO command processing option
  of RFE (REVIEW Front End).  REVTSO is not a TSO command.

  The processing panel presented by this option offers a number of
  advantages over the TSO global subcommand, the main ones being:

  (1) An extended input area is presented allowing command input
      up to 234 characters in length.
  (2) The ten most recently issued commands are saved, and can be
      recalled by cursor selection.  That is, when the command input
      area is empty and the cursor is placed on a screen line which
      displays a previously issued command, that entire command is
      recalled and placed in the main input area for optional editing
      before being executed again.
  (3) Unlike the dynamic command recall stack which commences with
      the initial TSO command which sets up the REVIEW environment,
      the ten most recent commands can be saved in permanent storage
      residing in the profile data set.

  In general, the above listed advantages not withstanding, this
  TSO command processing option has restrictions similar to those
  imposed on the global TSO subcommand.  In particular, this RFE
  option does not provide any special ability to initiate APF
  authorized TSO processing.

  As with the global TSO subcommand, CLIST commands can be implicitly
  invoked.

  Should the user wish to not save the updated recent commands list
  the option can be exited using the CANCEL command.  Note that if
  any CANCEL operands are present the input is treated as a request
  to issue the TSO CANCEL (FIB) command.  The abbreviation CAN is not
  subject to this operand test.

  As with ISPF option 6, individual commands can be prevented from
  being recorded in the displayed list of recent commands simply
  by prefixing the command string with 'TSO '.  This has the effect
  of causing the command to be issued via the global TSO command
  facility instead of via the logic of the TSO command option.

  Exiting the TSO command processing option with the END command,
  or any inter-option jump string commencing with the equals sign
  '=' causes the current recent command list to be passed back to
  RFE.  Note that the command list will only be saved to the profile
  data set at the termination of the logical session (or split screen).

  The profile data set is a single PDS allocated to the ISPPROF file
  under z/OS, or the REVPROF file under MVS/370.  From a data
  management point of view, the profile data set contains fixed-length
  80-byte records.  The saved commands for this option are stored
  in member $$REVTSO.

=KEYS=?
)F Function -
  The KEYS subcommand displays the current Program Function Key
  values.  Each PF Key (1 to 24) has a default value which may
  be changed with the PFK command.
)X Syntax -
     KEYS

 Alias    - ?
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=RECALL=RETRIEVE
)F Function -
  The RECALL subcommand causes previously typed-in commands to be
  displayed in the primary input area where they may be changed if
  required and then reissued.  Note that single character input strings
  and text implied by PFK usage are not recallable.  The first command
  recalled is the most recently typed in command.  Consecutive RECALL
  commands cause increasingly older commands to be recalled.
)X Syntax -
     RECALL

 Alias    - The DUP character (X'1C').
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=PFK
)F Function -
  The PFK subcommand changes PFK definitions for the duration of
  the REVIEW session; to change a PFK, a subcommand such as
  'PFK6 RIGHT 1'  is entered to change PFK6 to 'RIGHT 1'.

  By default, the PF KEYS are defined as the following:
              PFK1  - HELP    PFK2  - START      PFK3  - END
              PFK4  - TSO     PFK5  - RFIND      PFK6  - RCHANGE
              PFK7  - UP      PFK8  - DOWN       PFK9  - SWAP NEXT
              PFK10 - LEFT    PFK11 - RIGHT      PFK12 - RECALL
              PFK13 - TOP     PFK14 - BOTTOM     PFK15 - END
              PFK16 - SMF     PFK17 - RFIND      PFK18 - EREP
              PFK19 - UP      PFK20 - DOWN       PFK21 - HEX
              PFK22 - ASCII   PFK23 - TSO REV    PFK24 - HEXC

  Changes to the PFK assignments may be saved in the profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     PFK## 'newpfdata'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - nn and 'newpfdata'
)O Operands -
)P  ##      - Specifies the PF Key to be modified.
              ## is a 1 or 2 decimal digit number in the range of
              0 to 24 inclusive.  Numbers from 1 to 24 specify a
              particular Program Function Key.  If ## is 0 then
              all 24 PF Keys will be assigned their default values.

 'newpfdata'- Specifies the new subcommand for this PF Key.
=SCRNAME
)F Function -
  The SCRNAME subcommand allows a new name to be assigned to the
  active logical screen.  This name can be used as the operand of
  a SWAP subcommand.  Screen names are displayed by SWAP LIST.
)X Syntax -
     SCRNAME 'name'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - name
)O Operands -
)P 'name'   - Specifies the screen name.  It can be up to eight
              characters long.  It cannot be completely numeric.
              It should not be 'NEXT', 'PREV' or 'LIST'.
=START=SPLIT
)F Function -
  The SPLIT subcommand requests that a new parallel session is to be
  initiated and given control.  The new session will be under the
  RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will NOT
  be started if it would cause the maximum logical session limit to
  be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary option
  menu is shown.
)X Syntax -
     START  'option'

 Alias    - SPLIT
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'option' - any valid RFE main menu option.  An invalid option
              will cause the main menu to be shown with the
              'Invalid command' message.
=SWAP
)F Function -
  The SWAP subcommand specifies which parallel REVIEW session is to
  become the current session.  It can also list the started REVIEW
  sessions which are eligible to become the current session.  A
  parallel REVIEW session is created when the REVIEW TSO subcommand
  (not the ISPF TSO subcommand) is used to create a recursive REVIEW
  session.  The nesting order of these sessions can be changed by SWAP.
)X Syntax -
     SWAP   LIST / NEXT / PREV / # / 'name'

 Aliases  - None.
 Default  - switch to previous screen which is listed second
            by SWAP LIST
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'name'   - Specifies the target screen name which can be up to
            eight characters long.
))LIST    - Specifies that all parallel REVIEW sessions are to be
            listed.
))NEXT    - Requests switching to next session in increasing
            session-id order.
))PREV    - Requests switching to next session in decreasing
            session-id order.
))#       - Specifies the decimal number of the target session
            that is to be swapped with the current session.
            'SWAP 0' is a no-operation.
=TSO=TSS
)F Function -
  The TSO subcommand specifies a TSO command processor to be invoked
  from the REVIEW processor.  Commands generating an implicit EXEC
  such as SYSPROC member names and commands immediately prefixed by
  a percent sign (%) are supported.
)X Syntax -
     TSO  'command' 'operands'

 Alias    - TSS
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'command'
)O Operands -
)P 'command'  - Specifies a TSO command to be executed.

)P 'operands' - Specifies any desired operands for this TSO command.
=CANCEL=CAN
)F Function -
  The CANCEL subcommand performs the same processing as the END
  subcommand without saving the recent TSO command list changes made
  this session.  If the TSO command processing option is reselected
  the saved command list shown will be the same as at the start of
  the current session.  If CANCEL (but not CAN) has any operands
  specified it is processed as the TSO FIB command CANCEL and not
  as the local RFE subcommand, which allows the TSO CANCEL command
  to be issued from this option.
)X Syntax -
     CANCEL

 Alias    - CAN
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=END
)F Function -
  The END subcommand terminates the option and returns control
  to the RFE primary option menu.
)X Syntax -
     END

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=EXIT=RETURN==X
)F Function -
  The EXIT subcommand terminates the RFE logical session, also
  referred to as a parallel session, or "split screen".  When
  the last logical session is terminated the whole RFE/REVIEW
  environment is terminated, which usually means that the TSO
  READY prompt will be issued.
)X Syntax -
     EXIT

 Aliases  - RETURN, =X
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
