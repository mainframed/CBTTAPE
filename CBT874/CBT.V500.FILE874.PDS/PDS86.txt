)F FUNCTION -

 The -PDS86- command allows a TSO user to access and manipulate the
 directory and selected members of a PDS (partitioned data set) or
 a PDSE (partitioned data set extended).

 -PDS86- subcommands are available to display statistics on the data
 set directory and data set usage, modify the data set directory,
 modify the DCB attributes of the data set, compress the data set and
 validity check the data set.

 Additional subcommands can display portions of the member name
 directory, list occurrences of a search string in a member, restore
 a previously deleted member, create an alias for a member, display
 all aliases for a member, locate a member with desired attributes,
 and browse, view, list, delete, rename or update a member.

 For load data sets, subcommands are available to display and modify
 the linkage attributes of a module, list the history data for a
 module and map the CSECT structure of a module.

 For other partitioned data sets, subcommands are available to submit
 a JCL member, edit a member, print a member, compare two members in
 a data set and display ISPF statistics for a member.


  -PDS86- command features:
    Hexadecimal member names -- member names may be entered in hex for
    any of the subcommands which accept member names (or partial member
    names) as input.  Thus, for these subcommands, x'd7c4e2f9' and PDS9
    are equivalent.  Also, note that x'333' and x'0333' are equivalent.

    Default member names -- if no member name is entered for an
    ATTRIB, BROWSE, DCF, DELETE, DIRENTRY, DSPRINT, EDIT, FIND,
    FSE, HISTORY, IF, LIST, MAP, MEMBERS, MEMLIST, OUTCOPY, PRINTOFF,
    REPLACE, REPRO, REVIEW, SUBMIT, SUBLIST, TSOEDIT, TSOLIST, VIEW,
    VERIFY or VPSPRINT subcommand, the -PDS86- command will use the last
    member name or member group entered for any of these subcommands.
    In addition, note that the ALIAS, RENAME and RESTORE subcommands
    also modify the default member name.

    Member groups -- the above subcommands which allow default member
    names also accept ranges, patterns and combinations of member
    names:
      1.  A member name range is of the form name1:name2, which selects
          members based on character string ranges in their names.
      2.  A pattern member name is of the form name1/name2, which
          selects members based on character sting matches in their
          names.
      3.  A combination member name is of the form name1*name2, which
          selects members based on the range name1:name1 and on the
          pattern name2 in the remainder of the member name.

    Member lists -- the above subcommands which allow default member
    names also allow lists of member names which can be composed of
    normal member names and member group names.  When a member list is
    used, the subcommand receives control separately for each member
    specification in the list.

    Extended HELP -- additional help for numbered -PDS86- messages
    is available in the HELP data set; also, for warning and error
    messages, a .? subcommand may be entered to request explanations
    of the last few messages received.

    Sequential data sets -- the BROWSE, COPY, DCF, DSPRINT, EDIT,
    FIND, FIXPDS, FSE, LIST, PRINTOFF, REPLACE, REVIEW, SUBMIT,
    TSOEDIT, TSOLIST, VIEW, VERIFY and VPSPRINT subcommands are also
    defined for sequential data sets.  The documented syntax is
    unchanged except that no data is entered corresponding to any
    member name position.

    Subcommand name abbreviations -- subcommand names can be
    abbreviated to the first few characters of the subcommand name.
    Subcommand names are scanned in the order of output from the
    OPTIONS subcommand; the first match between the entered name
    and the subcommand name table is used.
)X SYNTAX -
     -PDS86- FILE(ddname) NUMBER(numb) XISPMODE /
              dsn VOLUME(name) VOLSET(name) SHR/OLD XISPMODE
              *** optionally followed by:  subcommand operands

 ALIASES  - none.
 DEFAULTS - SHR
 REQUIRED - FILE(ddname) or dsname
)O OPERANDS -
  dsn          - specifies the data set name.  If the data set name is
                 not entered in quotes ('), your TSO PREFIX will be
                 appended to the start of the entered data set name.

                 Note that if your system has password security, you
                 may enter your data set password after a slash (/)
                 and the data set name.  The syntax is: dsn/password


))FILE(ddname) - specifies the data set is already allocated with the
                 provided ddname.  Note that only disk data sets are
                 supported.  If the FILE keyword is used, dsname,
                 SHR/OLD, VOLSET and VOLUME should not also be used.

                 However, if the data set is concatenated, the SHR
                 or OLD keyword may be used since -PDS86- will
                 reallocate the data set.
))NUMBER(numb) - for use with FILE only, numb defaults to 1; specifies
                 the concatenation number desired for the ddname
                 identified.  If numb is larger than the number of
                 concatenated data sets, the last data set in the
                 sequence will be used.
))VOLUME(name) - specifies the volume name on which the data set
                 resides.  If a volume name is entered, SYSALLDA is
                 assumed as the unit name; otherwise, the unit name
                 from the catalog is used.

                 Note:  this parameter should be used if the data set
                 is not cataloged or if the catalog entry is not to be
                 used.  To use the catalog for a CHANGE subcommand
                 even if VOLSET is in effect, you may enter VOLUME(*).
))VOLSET(name) - specifies a default volume name for data set
                 references.  For example, if VOLSET(NEWRES) were
                 entered, subsequent CHANGE subcommands with a data
                 set name and no VOLUME parameter will assume a
                 VOLUME(NEWRES) parameter.

                 Note:  this parameter should be used if a default
                 volume is desired.  To nullify the effect of VOLSET,
                 enter VOLSET(*) on a subsequent CHANGE subcommand.

))SHR          - specifies that the data set is to be allocated with
                 a disposition of SHR.
))OLD          - specifies that the data set is to be allocated with
                 a disposition of OLD to prevent the use of this data
                 set by other users.
))XISPMODE     - may be used to request line mode when -PDS86- is
                 invoked under ISPF.
))SUBCOMMAND   - specifies that -PDS86- is not to process subcommands;
                 only the single subcommand entered and any of its
                 operands will be processed (ISPMODE and MEMLIST are
                 exceptions since they may be used to set the initial
                 processing mode).

                 Note: if a subcommand is entered on the command
                 line, no YES/NO prompting will be provided.
))OPERANDS     - specifies any desired operands for a subcommand
                 entered on the primary command line.

=ABE=AB
)F  Example -     ABE mema subcmds

 The ABE subcommand invokes the ABE editor to edit a member.

  ABE is an acronym for "A Better Editor".

  The ABE editor is an extremely sophisticated text editor which
    is written in PL1.  ABE requires the PL1 Optimizing Compiler
    Transient Library for its execution.

  ABE is a public-domain product, and may be obtained either from a
    NaSPA V.I.P. MVS tape, NaSPA, Milwaukee, WI. (414) 423-2420, or
    from the author, Tom G. Smith, Kimberly-Clark, Neenah, WI.
    (414) 735-2174.

  ABE also has an AID facility which guides the user to where he
    wants to go, while using this editor.

  PDS includes an excerpt from the TSO help that is offered with
    the ABE product.  This is a separate member in this install
    dataset called ABEHELP.  Much more detailed help comes with the
    ABE product as shipped.  The help information in ABEHELP is not
    complete or self-contained.  It is intended only to show the
    subcommands that are possible to use upon initial entry to the
    ABE editor.

=ATTRIB=A=AT=ATT=ATTR=ATTRI
)F  Example -     ATTRIB mema:memb rent reus refr

 The ATTRIB subcommand lists the attributes of a member.

 ***LOAD*** If the data set is a load library ***LOAD***  --
 The following linkage editor attributes are identified:
   AMODE     - addressing mode (if AMODE is not 24 or RMODE is not 24)
   AUTH      - APF authorized
   DC        - downward compatible (the module can be reprocessed by
               a level E linkage editor).
   LOAD ONLY - only loadable (OL -- the module can be brought into main
               storage only with a LOAD MACRO)
   NOT EDIT  - not editable (the module cannot be linkage edited)
   NOT EXEC  - not executable (the linkage editor noted an error and
               LET processing was not requested)
   OVERLAY   - overlay load module structure
   PAGE      - page alignment required
   REFR      - refreshable (replaceable by a new copy during execution)
   RENT      - reentrant (executable by several tasks simultaneously)
   REUS      - reusable (executable by several tasks in serial order)
   RLD error - if there is a mismatch between the directory RLD/CONTROL
               field and the first RLD entry of OS/VS linked modules
   RMODE     - residence mode (if RMODE is not 24 or AMODE is not 24)
   SCTR      - scatter load module structure
   SSI       - SSI information in hexadecimal
   TEST      - linked with the TEST option

 In addition, the ATTRIB subcommand can add or delete several linkage
 attributes for a load module.  When the ATTRIB subcommand is changing
 a module's attributes and the module is reentrant, the reusable
 attribute is also added as is done by the linkage editor.

 If a main module is assigned a RMODE or AMODE value, any associated
 alias directory entries are updated to reflect the same RMODE value
 and the main module's AMODE value.

 If the module is an alias (unless NOALIASINFO is specified or
 CONTROL NOALIASINFO is in effect), the name of any corresponding
 main member will be displayed if it exists; otherwise, the module
 name from the alias directory entry (the main module name at the
 time the alias was created) will be displayed.

 If the module is not an alias (unless NOALIASINFO is specified or
 CONTROL NOALIASINFO is in effect), the name of any corresponding
 alias members and any apparent aliases will be displayed.

 The ATTRIB subcommand has a single-line output format that is
 available for load modules; to use this format, enter SHORT as an
 ATTRIB keyword.  Note: if this format message is requested, many
 standard module checks are not performed and an incorrectly
 created or modified load module will not be detected.

 Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set if any attribute
 modifications are specified.  To ensure data set integrity, you
 should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of the data set
 update protection provided by the -PDS86- command for SHR
 allocations (for details, enter HELP UPDATE).

 ***SOURCE*** If the data set is not a load library ***SOURCE***  --
 ISPF statistics are displayed for members last saved by ISPF edit,
 SSI information can be added or changed before being displayed and
 alias information is displayed as follows:
   A.  If the member is an alias, it can be converted to a main
       member with the UNALIAS keyword.
   B.  If the member is an alias, an -A is displayed after the member
       name; unless NOALIASINFO is specified or CONTROL NOALIASINFO
       is in effect, the name of any corresponding main member will
       also be displayed.
   C.  If the member is not an alias and if ALIASINFO is specified,
       the name of any corresponding alias members and any apparent
       aliases will be displayed.
   D.  If the member has ISPF statistics or SSI information, it can
       be deleted by using the NONE keyword.
   E.  If the member does not have ISPF statistics, they may be added
       by using the ADDSTATS keyword.  ADDSTATS with the EXTEND keyword
       will add extended ISPF statistics (supported in z/OS 1.11).
   F.  If the member has directory information in ISPF format, the
       keywords VER, MOD, ID/USERID, CREATED, MODIFIED/LAST, TIME,
       and SECS/SS can be specified to modify ISPF statistics.
   G.  If the LONG operand is specified, ISPF size statistics will be
       displayed in 99,999,999 format.

=ALIAS=AL=ALI=ALIA
)F  Example -     ALIAS mainmem aliasmem

  The ALIAS subcommand assigns an alias name to a member.

  If the data set is not a load library, the alias name may be used
  as an alternate name for the identified member.

  If the data set is a load library, then if the alias name is an
  imbedded external name within the load module, that external name
  will be used as the alias entry point; otherwise, the entry point
  of the named member will be used as the alias entry point.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set. To ensure data set
  integrity, you should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of
  the data set update protection provided by the -PDS86- command for
  SHR allocations (for details, enter HELP UPDATE).

=BLK3380=BLK338
)F  Example -     BLK3380 133

  The BLK3380 command computes an optimal blocksize for a data set
  to be placed on a 3380 disk pack.  The program output includes
  the following reports:
     1.  A summary blocksize report for the given lrecl and key
         length which includes the recommended blocksize to use.
     2.  A recommended data set space allocation.
     3.  A optional track capacity report for the provided key length.

  The recommended blocksize value is for data sets in which the
  predominant access is sequential; for data sets where random
  access time is critical or the usual access is random, a small
  blocksize (500-2000 bytes) should probably be used.

  The recommended blocksize will usually tend to be near a half-track
  figure as this is considered to be the most efficient in terms of
  the trade-offs among buffer size, secondary storage requirements,
  channel use, number of input/outputs and overall processing time.
  This figure is only a general guide; for maximal efficiency
  considering other factors, study the generated blocksize summary
  report or a track capacity report.

  The program's recommendations assume a fairly large amount of data
  is to be stored; data sets which occupy only a few tracks should
  probably be placed in partitioned data sets.  In cases where this
  is not feasible, the use of a small blocksize (2400 - 4000 bytes)
  may be a good alternative practice.

                  And membero may be a data set name if sequential.

  membern       - the new member which is to be compared with membero.

                  a member from a different data set is to be used.
                  And membern may be a data set name if sequential.

                  If the new data set is a partitioned data set and
                  no member name is coded, the base member name will
                  be used; this can be used to compare two different
                  levels of the same module.

  operands      - optional, may include any desired COMPARE operands.

                  Note: The first operand after the file/member
                  specification in a SuperC COMPARE can be
                  BYTE, FILE, or WORD to change the compare type
                  (from the LINE default).

                    compare 'file1' 'file2' file
=COMPRESS=COMPR=COMPRE=COMPRES
)F  Example -     COMPRESS summary

 The COMPRESS subcommand invokes IEBCOPY (or a compatible program)
 to compress a partitioned data set.

 Note: a COMPRESS operation should not be interrupted with an attention
 since data sets are updated in-place.

 Caution: this subcommand modifies the output data set.  To ensure
 data set integrity, you should allocate the output data set as OLD
 or NEW, or be aware of the data set update protection provided by
 the -PDS86- command for SHR allocations (for details, enter
 HELP UPDATE).

=CONDEND=COND=CONDE=CONDEN
)F  Example -     CONDEND ERRORS

   The CONDEND subcommand terminates -PDS86- if any subcommand
   has one or more warning or error level messages.  After -PDS86- is
   terminated by CONDEND, the return code will be 4 for warning
   messages (PDS400W-PDS599W) and 8 for error messages (PDS600E-
   PDS999E).

   This subcommand is normally used to check that a critical
   subcommand in background is working as expected.  Normally, -PDS86-
   will continue to execute after program warning or error
   messages are received.  With this facility, you can terminate a
   -PDS86- process when it is not functioning properly.

   Note: Use TSO program IKJEFT1A in background to terminate the
         jobstep after a non-zero return code is received.

   CONDEND in PDS works differently than CONDEND in StarTool.

   When CONDEND is issued in a PDS batch job or CLIST, it
   will remain in effect until it is triggered by a WARNING or
   ERROR message or until CONDEND OFF is issued.

   CONDEND in StarTool will only terminate the previous subcommand
   if it had one or more warning or error level messages.

   The subcommand groups below are equivalent.

=CONTROL=CON=CONT=CONTR=CONTRO
)F  Example -     CONTROL dsname(lib.cntl(pdsdata)) old

 The CONTROL subcommand specifies global and immediate processing
 options.

 Most CONTROL subcommand operands (such as ALIASINFO and SINGLE) are
 global in that they remain in effect until reset by another CONTROL
 subcommand.

 The other operands (such as TESTABEND and IOSTATS) are immediate and
 take effect for only a single CONTROL subcommand.

 CONTROL does not utilize ISPF services; however, when it is first
 invoked with either a SYSOUT or DSNAME keyword, -PDS86- attempts
 to establish an ISPF environment so that subsequent subcommands can
 utilize ISPF services.

 Note that the input buffering type (SINGLE, DOUBLE or MULTIPLE) is
 reset for each data set allocated according to the device type on
 which the data set resides.  MULTIPLE buffering is used for device
 types which support the READ MULTIPLE CCW and DOUBLE is used
 otherwise.

=COPY=COP
)F  Example -     COPY mem1:mem2 other.dataset new tra spa(5,5) dir(20)

  The COPY subcommand builds copy control statements and invokes a
  copy program to selectively copy members to another data set.

  Note: members may not be copied back into the input data set;
  however, you can perform this function with a REPRO subcommand
  using the TO or AS keyword.

  In most instances, IEBCOPY is used to perform the actual data copy
  operation; however, in the following cases, IEBGENER is used
  instead of IEBCOPY:
    1. the input data set is sequential.
    2. a single member is copied to a sequential output data set.

  In addition, if the output data set is sequential and more than
  one input member is selected for copy, IEBCOPY will create an
  output data set in IEBCOPY unload format.

  If the TO (or the equivalent AS) keyword is used, each member is
  renamed in the copy in a generic fashion.  For example, if TO(X12)
  is entered, each resulting member name is formed by placing X12
  over the first three characters of the original member name.  An
  exception to this rule is made when only a single member is to be
  copied and its aliases are not also requested; in this case, the
  member name is taken directly from the TO keyword.

  Normally an IEBCOPY COPY operation is requested; however, if the
  data set contains load modules (RECFM is U) and the input and output
  blocksizes differ, a COPYMOD operation will be requested with a
  MAXBLK operand set to the output data set blocksize.  A COPYMOD
  operation may be explicitly requested for load module libraries by
  specifying MAXBLK and the maximum member blocksize.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the output data set.  To ensure
  data set integrity, you should allocate the output data set as OLD
  or NEW, or be aware of the data set update protection provided by
  the -PDS86- command for SHR allocations (for details, enter
  HELP UPDATE).

               SHR, NEW, TRK, CYL, DIR, SPACE, VOLUME, DSNTYPE, and
               MAXGENS keywords should not be used.

               However, if the data set is concatenated, the SHR
               or OLD keyword may be used since -PDS86- will
               reallocate the data set.
))NUMBER(nm) - for use with FILE only, nm defaults to 1; specifies
               the concatenation number desired for the ddname
               identified.  If nm is larger than the number of
               concatenated data sets, the last data set in the
               sequence will be used.
))OLD        - specifies that exclusive use of the output data set is
               to be obtained.
))SHR        - specifies that shared use of the output data set is
               sufficient; -PDS86- will provide output data set
               protection as documented under HELP UPDATE.
))NEW        - specifies that the output data set is to be created.
               When NEW is specified, TRK/CYL, DIR, SPACE, DSNTYPE,
               and MAXGENS keywords may also be specified.
))TRK        - specifies that the output data set is to be allocated
               in tracks.  If TRK or CYL is not entered, the default
               is calculated as follows:
                 a.  If SPACE is entered, TRK is the default.
                 b.  Otherwise, the default is taken from the input
                     data set.
))CYL        - specifies that the output data set is to be allocated
               in cylinder units.  If TRK or CYL is not entered,
               the default is calculated as follows:
                 a.  If SPACE is entered, TRK is the default.
                 b.  Otherwise, the default is taken from the input
                     data set.
))DIR(num)   - specifies the number of directory blocks for the
               output data set.  If DIR is not entered, the default
               is taken from the input data set.
))SPACE(p,s) - specifies the primary and secondary quantities for
               the output data set in track or cylinder units.

               If TRK or CYL is not entered but SPACE is entered,
               TRK is the default allocation quantity.

               If SPACE is not entered, the default is taken from
               the input data set.
))DSNTYPE(typ)-typ is specified as LIBRARY for a PDSE or PDS for a
               partitioned data set.
))MAXGENS(num)-specifies the maximum number of PDSE member generations
               to be retained by the system.  A number from 1 to
               2 billion and subject to the SMS MAXGENS_LIMIT.

               Note that DSNTYPE(LIBRARY) is required when using
               this operand if the input PDS is not a PDSE.
))ALIAS      - specifies that any associated members (aliases, apparent
               aliases and associated main members) are also to be
               copied.
))NOALIAS    - specifies that only the member(s) specifically
               identified are to be copied.
))AS(pname)  - pname defines the name of any output members.  For
               example, with AS(new) and the input members, AA, ABBA
               and IBM04, members named NEW, NEWA and NEW04 will be
               created.  AS and TO are equivalent keywords.

               Note that if only a single member is input and the
               ALIAS keyword is not entered, the resulting member
               name is taken only from the AS or TO keyword.
))TO(pname)  - pname defines the name of any output members.  For
               example, with TO(new) and the input members, AA, ABBA
               and IBM04, members named NEW, NEWA and NEW04 will be
               created.  TO and AS are equivalent keywords.

               Note that if only a single member is input and the
               ALIAS keyword is not entered, the resulting member
               name is taken only from the AS or TO keyword.
))CALL       - specifies that the copy program is to be invoked.
))NOCALL     - specifies that the copy program is not to be invoked;
               member checking, control card generation and data set
               allocations will still be performed.

               Note: since messages are issued for existing members
               in the output data set, this keyword could be used to
               verify member existence between different data sets.
))EXIST      - specifies that only the subset of memgroup that is
               also present in the output data set is to be copied
               (normally the REPLACE keyword would also be used).
))NOEXIST    - specifies that only the subset of memgroup that is
               not present in the output data set is to be copied.
))EXCLUDE    - invert the normal copy "select" statements to
               "exclude" statements.  The use of this option also
               turns off BLDL (member existence) checking for the
               target library.
))NOBLDL     - do not perform BLDL (member existence) checking in the
               target library.  Use this parameter when performance
               of the COPY subcommand is very important and BLDL
               checking by -PDS86- for possible errors is not
               important.
))MAXBLK(nm) - for RECFM=U members only, specifies the maximum member
               blocksize and that a COPYMOD operation is required.
               Note: for load module copies, a COPYMOD operation will
               also be invoked if the input and output data set
               blocksizes differ.
))REPLACE    - specifies that members in the output data set are to
               be replaced by any copied members.
))NOREPLACE  - specifies that no members in the output data set are
               to be replaced by any copied members; warning messages
               will be issued to document the uncopied member names
               unless EXIST or NOEXIST is also entered.
))SUMMARY    - specifies that only copy summary and error messages
               are to be displayed.
))LIST       - specifies that all copy messages are to be displayed.
))NOLIST     - specifies that no copy messages are to be displayed.
))VOLUME(vo) - for NEW data sets, specifies the output volume name;
               for existing data sets, this parameter should be used
               if the output data set is not cataloged.
=CPKMAP=CPKM=CPK=CP=TRKMAP=TRKM=TRK=TR
)F  Example -     TRKMAP mvsres

 The TRKMAP subcommand displays a track map for a volume.

 The DISKMAP (CBT 792) program or the FDR COMPAKTOR program is used
 based on the value of global variable &MAPPGM:

                 volume.
=DISASM=DISAS=DISA
)F  Example -     DISASM member csect

   The DISASM subcommand reconstructs assembler language instructions
   from a module; this procedure is often referred to as "decoding" or
   "disassembling" instructions.

   The output will consist of the following:

   1.  Directory information.
   2.  External symbol table.
   3.  Hex dump of CSECT.
   4.  Assembler language instructions for CSECT.

   Global variable &ASMPGM determines which disassembler will be used.

   1. DISASM  - (CBT 217) with RESOURCE/REBUILD for PDSE's (CBT 234).
   2. ASMDASM - (HLASM toolkit).

  csect    - optional, specifies the CSECT to be disassembled.

             DISASM:
             If CSECT is omitted, then the first CSECT will be used.

             DISASM/RESOURCE/REBUILD (PDSE):
             CSECT name will default to the load module name.

             ASMDASM:
             The CSECT name is optional.  If it is specified, the named
             CSECT must exist in the module or object module.  If
             omitted, the CSECT with ESDID=0001 is disassembled.

  Note:  The ASMDASM program (HLASM toolkit) can disassemble an object
         module in a sequential dataset.  In this case, the DISASM
         subcommand must be entered from the command line and a
         pseudo load module member name must be used.
=DISPLAY=D=DI=DIS=DISP=DISPL=DISPLA
)F  Example -     DISPLAY aa b4

   The DISPLAY subcommand lists member names from the data set
   directory.  Note: the default member group is not affected by
   either the DISPLAY or PATTERN subcommands.

   Note that -A is added following a displayed member name if the
   member name is an alias.  The member name is listed in a combined
   hexadecimal/character format if it does not contain upper case
   alphanumeric characters (including @, $ and #) or if the first
   character is numeric.  Unprintable characters (for 3270-type
   devices) in a member name are displayed as periods.

            of the member name) at which the display is to start. If
            omitted, the entire directory is displayed.

            Note: a group name descriptor such as part1:part2,
            seg1/seg2 or part1*seg1 may be entered for name1, in
            which case, the output will consist of the member names
            which would be displayed by the MEMBERS subcommand.

  name2   - optional, specifies the ending member name (or portion of
            the member name) after which the display is to stop.  If
            omitted, the display continues to the end of the directory.
=DCF=DC
)F  Example -     DCF mema:memb twopass index file(myfile)

=DSAT=DSA
)F  Example -     DSAT lib

 The DSAT command is used to display allocation information for data
 sets on a direct access device.

 DSAT will search the catalog for the entries for the data sets
 specified.  Allocation information will be obtained from the volume
 table of contents, formatted and displayed.  If a name is an index
 name, all data sets below the index will be displayed.

 You may bypass the catalog search by supplying the volume name
 on which the data set resides.  This option permits displaying
 information for uncataloged data sets.

 DSAT may be used in CLISTs to find the allocation of a data set or a
 group of data sets and set the return code to the specified value.
 The return code may then be tested with the WHEN command.  Output may
 be suppressed by specifying NOPRINT.  The HARDCOPY keyword may be
 used to direct the output to a pre-allocated data set.

 The attributes to be displayed may be selected by specifying
 keyword operands.

 The information that may be displayed is:
    1. Volume name on which the data set is located.
    2. File sequence number.
    3. Device type code from catalog entry.
    4. Allocation  (allocated, free, and extents).
    5. Secondary allocation (amount and units).
    6. Data set organization.
    7. DCB  (RECFM, BLKSIZE, and LRECL).
    8. Creation date.
    9. Expiration date.
   10. Last date referenced

=FIND=F=FI=FIN
)F  Example -     FIND mema:memb /this data/

  The FIND subcommand displays portions of a member which contain a
  search string.  Optionally, the THEN or ELSE keywords may be entered
  to allow conditional execution of other subcommands.

  Unprintable characters for 3270-type devices are translated to
  periods before they are displayed.

  The FIND formats are NUM, SNUM, NONUM, LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP;
  for load modules, the NUM, SNUM and NONUM formats are equivalent
  to the LDUMP format.

  The default format is initially NUM; however, each time a format
  operand is entered on a LIST, FIND or REPLACE subcommand, the value
  entered is used as the output format for subsequent LIST, FIND and
  REPLACE subcommands.  Also, note the following:
    A. Formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM limit the search and display length
       for logical records to 256 characters.
    B. Column 72 is not searched for formats NUM or SNUM if the record
       format is fixed with 80 character records.
    C. Formats BLOCK and DUMP apply to physical records; the other
       formats apply to logical records; and for load modules, LBLOCK
       and LDUMP formats apply to CSECT data.
    D. Formats LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP display only those
       segments of a record which contain the search string; however,
       a following segment will also be displayed if the string spans
       a segment boundary.

                more information, enter HELP GROUP.

  string     -  optional, the string to be searched for.  It is coded
                as a delimited string like +searched for+.  If the
                string is not entered or is null, the last string
                entered will be used. The string may contain one to
                32 characters.  If the ASIS keyword is entered, the
                string will not be translated to upper case letters.

                As an alternative, hexadecimal data may be entered as
                a string delimited with x's like x0123456789abcdefx.

  FIND format control keywords are as follows:
))NUM        -  The line number field (the last 8 bytes of a fixed-
                format record or the first 8 bytes otherwise) of
                each logical record is examined; if the field is not
                numeric, formatting is switched to NONUM mode for the
                remainder of the member.

                For ISPF-saved members, the high-order six digits of
                the line number field is formatted; otherwise, the
                low-order six digits of the line number field is
                formatted by suppressing leading zeroes.  The line
                number segment is followed by a blank and up to 249
                characters of data from the logical record.
))SNUM       -  The line number field (the last 8 bytes of a fixed-
                format record or the first 8 bytes otherwise) is
                discarded.  Up to 256 bytes from a logical record are
                searched or displayed.
))NONUM      -  Up to 256 bytes from a logical record are searched or
                displayed.
))LBLOCK     -  Logical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement
                in the logical record) and segments of 64 characters
                surrounded by asterisks.  Only formatted segments
                which contain the search string are displayed;
                however, a following segment will also be displayed
                if the string spans a segment boundary.

                Note: for load modules, only CSECT data will be
                searched or displayed and if the partial name Partm is
                entered in a MODULE operand, only those CSECT or ENTRY
                names matching Partm will be searched or displayed.
                CSECT records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (a module offset and a CSECT offset) and
                segments of 64 characters surrounded by asterisks.
))LDUMP      -  Logical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement
                in the logical record), segments of up to 32
                characters of hexadecimal data and up to 16 bytes of

                formatted segments which contain the search string
                are displayed; however, a following segment will also
                be displayed if the string spans a segment boundary.

                Note: for load modules, only CSECT data will be
                searched or displayed and if the partial name Partm is

                are displayed; however, a following segment will also
                be displayed if the string spans a segment boundary.
  FIND search argument keywords are as follows:
))CAPS        - default, if a character string search argument is
                entered, it will be translated to upper case letters.
))ASIS        - if specified, a character search argument will not be
                translated to upper case letters.
))IGNORE      - if specified, search for upper and lower-case data
                matching the specified string.
  FIND control keywords are as follows:
))OFFSET(Hx)  - for LBLOCK and LDUMP formats only; Hx may be entered
                as a 1 to six digit hexadecimal number to specify
                the module offset at which the search is to begin.

                If both MODULE AND OFFSET keywords are entered, the
                offset applies to each module selected.
))MODULE(Partm)-for LBLOCK or LDUMP formats only; Partm may be entered
                as a 1 to 8 byte partial external name to limit the
                CSECT or ENTRY names to be searched or displayed to
                those matching the partial name Partm.

                If the form MODULE(*) is used, the previous partial
                name entered on any MODULE keyword will be used.

                If both MODULE AND OFFSET keywords are entered, the
                offset applies to each module selected.
))SKIPREC(n)  - n is coded as 0 through 9999999 to specify the number
                of logical records (physical records for BLOCK or
                DUMP formats) to ignore at the beginning of a member.
))MAXIN(n)    - n is coded as 0 through 9999999 to specify the maximum
                number of logical records (physical records for BLOCK
                or DUMP formats) to input for a member after
                satisfying any SKIPREC operand.
))MAXOUT(n)   - n is coded as 0 through 9999999 to specify the maximum
                number of logical records (partial logical records for
                LBLOCK or LDUMP formats; partial physical records for
                BLOCK or DUMP formats) to output for a member.
))MAXFIND(n)  - n is coded as 0 through 9999999 to specify the maximum
                number of strings that are to be located.
))SKIPCOL(n)  - n is coded as 0 through 99999 to specify the number
                of columns to ignore at the beginning of each logical
                record (physical record for BLOCK or DUMP formats).

                Note: for NUM or SNUM output format with record
                format V, SKIPCOL(0) refers to the first data position
                after the line number field.
))MAXLEN(n)   - n is coded as 0 through 99999 to specify the maximum
                length of a logical record (physical record for BLOCK
                or DUMP formats) to search or display.
))FIRST       - Specifies that all remaining data in the member is
                to be listed after the first occurrence of the string.
))NOFIRST     - Specifies that only string matches are to be listed.
  FIND conditional keywords are as follows:
))THEN(action) - The THEN subcommand is executed if the string is
                 found in a member.  The subcommand may be ATTRIB,
                 BROWSE, DIRENTRY, DELETE, EDIT, END, FIND, FSE,
                 HISTORY, LIST, MAP, MEMBERS, MEMLIST, NEWML, OUTCOPY,
                 PRINTOFF, REVIEW, SUBMIT, SUBLIST, TSOEDIT, TSOLIST,
                 VIEW or VERIFY.

                 NEWML is similar to MEMLIST except it also performs
                 a MEMLIST RESET.
))ELSE(action) - The ELSE subcommand is executed if the string is not
                 found in a member.  The subcommand may be ATTRIB,
                 BROWSE, DIRENTRY, DELETE, EDIT, END, FIND, FSE,

                 NEWML is similar to MEMLIST except it also performs
                 a MEMLIST RESET.
=FIXPDS=FIXPD=FIXP=FIX
)F  Example -     FIXPDS release recfm(fba)

  The FIXPDS subcommand can perform several data set utility
  functions for sequential, partitioned and PDSE data sets.

  After the FIXPDS subcommand gains control, it writes messages
  regarding the data set action to be taken and any potential error
  conditions.  FIXPDS will prompt the user before making any data set
  changes unless CONTROL NOPROMPT is in effect.


  Following are more detailed implementation notes on several of the
  different functions available through the FIXPDS subcommand:
    A.  EXPANDDIR (expand the directory -- ignored for sequential)
        or FREEDIR (adjust free blocks  -- ignored for sequential)
        1.  If no members exist in the data set, RESET is used
        2.  The names of any members that will be moved out of the
            way of the expanded directory are listed
        3.  If any of these members are in use by an ISPF edit session,
            a warning message is issued
        4.  As each member is moved, an informational message is issued
        5.  The additional directory blocks are written

    B.  RESET (reset the directory and the data set)
        1.  If any members exist in the data set, a warning message
            is issued
        2.  If any members are in use by an ISPF edit session, a
            warning message is issued
        3.  The data set's directory blocks are rewritten with null
            data, destroying any existing member information
        4.  The end of data marker (DS1LSTAR) is reset to indicate
            an empty partitioned data set.
        5.  The RESET of a PDSE directory is done with the STOW
            Initialize function.

    C.  INITDIR (initialize the directory)
        1.  If any members exist in the data set, a warning message
            is issued
        2.  If any members are in use by an ISPF edit session, a
            warning message is issued
        3.  The data set's directory blocks are rewritten with null
            data, destroying any existing member information
        4.  The end of data marker (DS1LSTAR) is not modified.

    C.  DCB (modify the DCB attributes)
        1.  If a data type keyword such as ASM, CLIST, CNTL, LOAD or
            OBJECT is entered, RECFM and LRECL default values are
            provided from a table and a BLKSIZE value is determined
            based on the allocated device type
        2.  If any RECFM, LRECL or BLKSIZE values are specifically
            requested by keyword, these values will override the
            values as determined from the data type keywords entered.
        3.  The data set is opened for output with any new DCB
            parameters

    D.  Release operands: each operand formats a call to
        the TSO RELEASE command as follows:
        1.  RELEASE     - RELEASE 'data.set.name'          VOL(volume)
        2.  RELEXT      - RELEASE 'data.set.name' EXTENT   VOL(volume)
        3.  RELSAVE(nn) - RELEASE 'data.set.name' SAVE(nn) VOL(volume)

    E.  MAXSPACE (mark all allocated space in use)
        1.  All extents of the data set are marked in use by setting
            the end of data marker (DS1LSTAR) value to the last disk
            address for the data set.
        2.  This could be used in conjunction with a RESTORE subcommand
            to attempt to recover members which were deleted prior to a
            data set compress.
        3.  For example, the following sequence of subcommands could be
            used to recover lost members after a PDS is destroyed by
            sequential output to the directory (the new data blocks will
            take one or more tracks followed by a blank track for the
            end of file marker):
            a.  FIXPDS MAXSPACE
                (to mark all allocated space in use).
            b.  FIXPDS INITDIR(80)
                (to reinitialize the directory).
            c.  RESTORE name REPEAT NOPROMPT NODISPLAY
                (to restore all deleted members).
            d.  VERIFY :
                (to find invalid members after the previous DS1LSTAR).
            e.  BROWSE name
                (to scan contents of members)
            f.  DELETE name
                (to delete members not needed).
            g.  Note: any members that were previously recorded on
                the tracks overwritten by the sequential data or the
                following track cannot be restored with this technique.

    F.  ADDTRK or ADDCYL (add one secondary extent)
        1.  An extent is added to the data set in the units given in
            the subcommand.  For example, ADDTRK(12) will add one
            secondary extent of 12 tracks while ADDCYL(4) will add
            one secondary extent of 4 cylinders.
        2.  Note that this operation is independent of any secondary
            extent information associated with the data set; it can
            add a single extent of the specified size to a data set
            even if the data set was allocated without secondary
            extents.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set. To ensure data set
  integrity, you should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of
  the data set update protection provided by the -PDS86- command for
  SHR allocations (for details, enter HELP UPDATE).

      one of the valid descriptive qualifiers for FSE (ASM, BASIC,
      CLIST, CNTL, COBOL, DATA, IPLI, LIST, PLI, TEXT or VSBASIC),
      that qualifier is passed to FSE.
   B. If the low-level qualifier is FORT, GOFORT is passed to FSE.
   C. Otherwise, the data type qualifier is not a valid descriptive
      qualifier and the general descriptive qualifier, DATA, is
      passed to FSE.

                   Note that if neither a THEN nor an ELSE operand is
                   entered, THEN(ATTRIB) is the default condition.

                   NEWML is similar to MEMLIST except it also performs
                   a MEMLIST RESET.
))ELSE(action)   - The ELSE subcommand is executed if any condition is

  Caution:

  IF : conditions THEN(SUBLIST) may not change the current
  member group if there are no members that meet the defined
  conditions.

  Hence, the use of "*" in a subsequent subcommand will use
  the current member group ":" set by the IF subcommand and
  might cause different results than expected.

)F  Example -     ISPMODE

  The ISPMODE subcommand switches -PDS86- to a full screen
  session display mode.  Subcommands entered and the outputs from
  internal -PDS86- subcommands are maintained in a session log.

  There can be nine session logs and they can be displayed with
  the SHOW command.  Enter SHOW ? to display the prompting panel.

  SHOW operands:
     n       - switch to one of 9 log tables (value 1 to 9)
     RESET   - Clear table before building a new table.
     NODISPL - after switching or resetting the table do not display it
               but return to previous function table display

  For more specific information on ISPMODE, enter the ISPF HELP command
  while in ISPMODE.

  For additional information on the relationship of -PDS86- and
  the ISPMODE subcommand, enter HELP DIALOG.


  In the following, ISPMODE processing provided in -PDS86- is
  described in more detail:

   A.  When ISPMODE is active, the PUTLINE and PUTGET routines are
       monitored for data.

       1.  As each output line is added by PUTLINE, ISPMODE adds
           another session table entry.

       2.  If an output checkpoint (default is 2000 output lines) is
           reached for a subcommand, ISPMODE positions the session
           display to the beginning of the output of this subcommand
           and allows the user to continue or terminate.  Note: this
           screen must be responded to before any -PDS86- subcommands
           may be entered.  Valid responses are as follows:
             a.  0   - continue with the subcommand's output
             b.  END - terminate the subcommand
             c.  F   - search the ISPMODE log
             d.  X   - clear portions of the ISPMODE log
             e.  an ISPF command or PF key

       3.  When a PUTGET is issued by -PDS86-, ISPMODE positions the
           session display to the beginning of the output of the
           just completed subcommand.  A -PDS86- subcommand, an ISPF
           command, a PF key or an ISPMODE session control code may
           be entered at this time.


   B.  The ISPMODE session control codes are as follows:

       1 - Suspend ISPMODE: this control code terminates ISPMODE,
           retains the session log and enters line mode processing.
           ISPMODE can be restarted using the previous session log
           with another ISPMODE subcommand.  At the end of -PDS86-
           processing, the session log is always discarded.

           Note:  XISPMODE is an alias for this control code.

       2 - Clear log: discards all lines of the session log.

       4 - Sets the sublist to members in the current MEMLIST.  Same as
           SUBLIST=MEMLISI.

       5 - Check aliases: checks main and alias members by TTR
           in current MEMLIST.

       6 - MEMLIST (all members): invokes a scrollable member list
           for all members.  PDS line commands can be entered on
           individual member lines.

       7 - Output ISPMODE table: invokes a panel which prompts for
           a SYSOUT class or data set name which is to contain a
           copy of the ISPMODE table.

       8 - View log.

       9 - Swap panels (NORM, ALT, DUAL).

           NORM - Swap to normal display (left display)
           ALT  - Swap to alternate table display (right display)
           DUAL - Swap to dual line or 3rd table display
                  (LEFT and RIGHT scroll commands or PFK keys
                   can be used if set up during installation)

       F - Find log: finds character strings in the session view
           log and positions the current display start location
           and cursor position on the current line.

       O - Options: subcommand selection menu.

       X - Clear log: discards some portion (ALL, ABOVE or BELOW)
           of the session log relative to the current table location.

           X ABOVE or UP    -  delete all lines above the current line
           X BELOW or DOWN  -  delete all lines below the current line
           X ALL            -  delete all lines
           X -nnn           -  delete nnn lines above the current line
           X nnn            -  delete nnn lines below the current line

       = - sets the sublist to members in the current MEMLIST.  Same as
           SUBLIST=MEMLISI.

       * - sets the MEMLIST to the current member group.  Same as
           MEMLIST *.

      FN - ISPMODE function selection.

           fn.lista  -  jump to list allocation prompt
           fn.listc  -  jump to list file prompt
           fn.listf  -  jump to list file prompt
           fn.listv  -  jump to list volume prompt

      FU - ISPMODE function status display.


  ISPMODE notes:

    1.  Only the first 158 characters of an output line are retained
        in the output table; this is a consideration for the LIST and
        FIND subcommands with output formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM.

    2.  Echoed input lines are identified with a > character in the
        first log position and any continuation lines are identified
        by a - character in the first log position.

    3.  The f command is a log search command and not the -PDS86-
        FIND subcommand.  If you want the FIND subcommand, enter fi,
        fin or find.

    4.  ISPF commands FIND, RFIND, RCHANGE, LEFT and RIGHT are not
        functional with ISPF table handling.

    5.  Subcommands END, HELP and TSO are intercepted by ISPF instead
        of the -PDS86- program; if you wish to use these subcommands,
        you must use an abbreviated name (EN, H, HE, HEL and T or TS).

    6.  Since ISPMODE only displays -PDS86- output at a checkpoint or
        at the completion of a subcommand, output from a subcommand
        cannot be monitored as it is produced.  Therefore, if -PDS86-
        is in a CPU loop, the screen will lock until an attention is
        received.  At that time, any outputs generated will be
        displayed and an appropriate response may be given.

    7.  If a -PDS86- subcommand is too long for the 48 character input
        field, you may enter the first 47 or less characters followed
        by a + to indicate more data is required and a continuation
        panel with more room for operand entry will be provided.

    8.  The EXEC processor does not work as usual; CLIST processing
        is not currently supported from ISPMODE or MEMLIST.

        Suspend ISPF mode (special control code 1) or invoke PDS with
        the XISPMODE option.  When PDS subcommands are entered from a
        CLIST, YES/NO prompts are not provided; instead, YES responses
        are assumed in each case.

    9.  The CHANGE command with no operands presents a data set name
        prompting panel.

   10.  The COLS subcommand inserts a line into the session log
        containing column tick marks.  There are 4 variations of COLS.

        >COLS
        ....+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....

        >COLS ISPF
        ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----

        >COLS GLOBAL
        --------  ASSEMBLY  DEFAULT   ----------------------------------

        >COLS SUPERC
        SRCHFOR  ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+

   11.  The ST line command (on a MEMLIST Load Member List entry)
        will display the status of a load module by issuing the ATTRIB,
        HISTORY, and MAP subcommands.

   12.  / and ? are synonyms for the O(ptions) line command in all
        dialog table displays.

   13.  Point-and-shoot column headers in all dialog table displays
        will change the sort direction on successive shots.

        To easily identify which column headers can be sorted on,
        use the ISPF PSCOLOR command to change the default
        point-and-shoot color to something other than TURQ.

  for load modules, the NUM, SNUM and NONUM formats are equivalent
  to the LDUMP format.

  The default format is initially NUM; however, each time a format
  operand is entered on a LIST, FIND or REPLACE subcommand, the value
  entered is used as the output format for subsequent LIST, FIND and
  REPLACE subcommands.  Also, note the following:
    A. Formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM limit the display length for logical
       records to 256 characters.
    B. Formats BLOCK and DUMP apply to physical records; the other
       formats apply to logical records; and for load modules, LBLOCK
       and LDUMP formats apply to CSECT data.

  LIST format keywords are as follows:
))NUM        -  The line number field (the last 8 bytes of a fixed-
                format record or the first 8 bytes otherwise) of
                each logical record is examined; if the field is not
                numeric, formatting is switched to NONUM mode for the
                remainder of the member.

                For ISPF-saved members, the high-order six digits of
                the line number field is formatted; otherwise, the
                low-order six digits of the line number field is
                formatted by suppressing leading zeroes.  The line
                number segment is followed by a blank and up to 249
                characters of data from a logical record.
))SNUM       -  The line number field (the last 8 bytes for a fixed-
                format record or the first 8 otherwise) is discarded.
                Up to 256 bytes from a logical record are displayed.
))NONUM      -  Up to 256 bytes from a logical record are displayed.

                displayed and if the partial name Partm is entered
                in a MODULE operand, only those CSECT or ENTRY names
                matching Partm will be displayed.  CSECT records
                are formatted with two hexadecimal offsets (a module
                offset and a CSECT offset) and segments of 64
                characters surrounded by asterisks.
))LDUMP      -  Logical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement
                in the logical record), segments of up to 32

                and a CSECT offset), segments of up to 32 characters of
                hexadecimal data and up to 16 bytes of characters
                surrounded by asterisks.
))BLOCK      -  Physical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement
                in the physical record) and segments of 64 characters
                surrounded by asterisks.
))DUMP       -  Physical records are formatted with two hexadecimal
                offsets (displacement in the member and displacement

  LIST control keywords are as follows:
))OFFSET(Hx)  - for LBLOCK and LDUMP formats only; Hx may be entered
                as a 1 to six digit hexadecimal number to specify
                the module offset at which the display is to begin.

                If both MODULE AND OFFSET keywords are entered, the
                offset applies to each module selected.
))MODULE(Partm)-for LBLOCK or LDUMP formats only; Partm may be entered
                as a 1 to 8 byte partial external name to limit the
                CSECT or ENTRY names to be displayed to those matching
                the partial name Partm.

                If the form MODULE(*) is used, the previous partial
                name entered on any MODULE keyword will be used.

                If both MODULE AND OFFSET keywords are entered, the
                offset applies to each module selected.
))SKIPREC(n)  - n is coded as 0 through 9999999 to specify the number
                of logical records (physical records for BLOCK or
                DUMP formats) to ignore at the beginning of a member.

                of columns to ignore at the beginning of each logical
                record (physical record for BLOCK or DUMP formats).

                Note:  for NUM or SNUM output format with record
                format V, SKIPCOL(0) refers to the first data position
                after the line number field.
))MAXLEN(n)   - n is coded as 0 through 99999 to specify the maximum

 The MATCH subcommand invokes the Bill Godfrey PDSMATCH program
 to compare the directory and data from two PDS's.  Members are said
 to match if their names, and optionally their userdata, or data are
 the same.

 The MATCH subcommand is useful in comparing two PDS's which
 contain members with a known relationship (e.g., a PDS
 containing a new level of a software product).  BSAM is used to
 read the data blocks when the DATA operand is specified.

 PDSMATCH messages:

   process individual members.  In addition, ISPF commands, normal
   -PDS86- subcommands and session control codes may be entered to
   the right of COMMAND ===>

   MEMLIST processing includes the ISPMODE session display; thus,
   subcommands entered and their outputs are maintained in the
   ISPMODE log; more specific information can be obtained from the
   ISPF tutorial panels by entering the ISPF HELP command while in
   MEMLIST mode.

   If a -PDS86- subcommand is too long for the 48 character input

)F  Example -     OPTIONS

 The OPTIONS subcommand displays the subcommands (or options)
 supported by the -PDS86- command. Note that this display varies
 when a non-partitioned data set is being processed.

 Notes:
 1. When in ISPMODE or MEMLIST, if the O alias of OPTIONS is entered
    after COMMAND ===>, a panel of options are presented to assist in
    entering -PDS86- subcommands.
 2. When in MEMLIST, if the o alias of OPTIONS is entered as a line
    command, a panel of member options is presented to assist in
    entering -PDS86- subcommands.

=OFFLOAD=OFFLOA=OFFLO=OFFL=OFF=OF=COMBINE=COMBIN=COMBI=COMB
)F  Example -     OFFLOAD a:c seq

  The OFFLOAD subcommand offloads members of a PDS to a member of
  a PDS or a sequential data set.  An IEBUPDTE "./ ADD NAME="
  control statement is added before each output member and ISPF
  statistics are included for use by the PDSLOAD program (CBT 093).
  If extended ISPF statistics: 99,999,999 max for SIZE and INIT.

  Note: ./ in the input members is translated to >< in the output.

  The OFFLOAD subcommand invokes the David Brockway Cole OFFLOAD
  program (CBT 093).

 output.data - specifies the name of the output data set.  Standard
               TSO dsname syntax should be used.  This should be a
               cataloged sequential dataset unless NEW is specified.

=OUTCOPY=OU=OUT=OUTC=OUTCO=OUTCOP
)F  Example -     OUTCOPY mema:memb

  The OUTCOPY subcommand formats utility control statements
  which can be used by IEBCOPY to select members from a data set.

  OUTCOPY does not utilize ISPF services; however, when it is first
  invoked, it attempts to establish an ISPF environment so that
  subsequent subcommands can utilize ISPF services.

  OUTCOPY usage notes:
   A.  Output is directed to FILE(PDSOUT).
   B.  PDSOUT must be allocated to a sequential data set or to a
       member of a partitioned data set with fixed, 80 character
       records prior to entering the first OUTCOPY subcommand.
   C.  For new data sets, the default DCB attributes of
       DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120)  will be used.
   D.  An IEBCOPY COPY statement is written before the first SELECT
       statement for each data set as determined by the CHANGE
       subcommand; the COPY statement is of the form:
       COPY  OUTDD=OUTPUT,INDD=xxx
       where xxx is the low-level qualifier of the input data set name.
   E.  The default IEBCOPY select statement is of the form:
       S M=memname ,memname))
       Note -- memname is the member name; this format output statement
       can be modified by an editor if member rename or member replace
       functions are to be performed.

       If TEXT('Any String') was specified, each subsequent IEBCOPY
       statement changes to the form:
          S M=memname  ANY STRING
   F.  OUTCOPY maintains a list of member names written after each
       copy statement and does not output a member name more than once.
   G.  A CLIST such as the following could be established for IEBCOPY
       use:
        PROC 3 FROMDSN FROMQUAL TODSN CONTROLS(PDSOUT.CNTL)
        ALLOC F(SYSIN) DA(&CONTROLS.) SHR
        ALLOC F(SYSPRINT) DA(*)
        ALLOC F(&FROMQUAL.) DA(&FROMDSN.) SHR
        ALLOC F(OUTPUT) DA(&TODSN.) OLD
        CALL 'SYS1.LINKLIB(IEBCOPY)'

   H.  Assuming that OUTCOPY has created output in PDSOUT.CNTL, you
       could copy selected members from your LIB.LOAD data set to
       'SYS1.LINKLIB2', by entering the following line from
       READY mode:
       %copyout lib.load load 'sys1.linklib2'

  member     - optional, specifies the member name(s) to be output on
               an IEBCOPY format SELECT statement.

               Default member names, member lists, member name
               ranges and member name patterns are allowed; for
               more information, enter HELP GROUP.

))ALIAS      - Specifies that the names of any associated members
               (aliases, apparent aliases and associated main members)
               are also to be written to the PDSOUT data set.
))NOALIAS    - Specifies that only the names of members actually
               identified are to be written to the PDSOUT data set.
))ECHO       - Each IEBCOPY statement is to be written to the terminal
               as well as to the PDSOUT data set.
))NOECHO     - IEBCOPY statements are to be written to the PDSOUT
               data set only.
))IEBUPDTE   - Each output statement is to be written in IEBUPDTE
               format instead of the standard IEBCOPY format;
               Note: the use of this format also suppresses any COPY
               statements generated for data set changes.
))NOIEBUPDTE - Each output statement is to be written in IEBCOPY
               format.
))CLOSE      - The PDSOUT file is to be closed.  Note: the member or
               member group specified with the close operand is not
               output to the PDSOUT file.
))NOCLOSE    - The PDSOUT data set is to be opened or to stay open.
))TEXT('st') - The string, ST, is to replace the second member name on
               each subsequent SELECT output statement.
))NOTEXT     - The TEXT operand is to be nullified and the usual second
               member name is to be output on each subsequent SELECT
               output statement.

   The PATTERN subcommand lists member names from the data set
   directory.  Only those member names which contain the PATTERN
   name segments specified are displayed.  Note that the default
   member group is not affected by the DISPLAY or PATTERN subcommands.

   One or two member name segments may be entered as patterns.  If two
   segments are entered, both segments must occur in a member name for
   it to be displayed.  For example, with the pattern segments xx and
   1x, members named M1X4XX, M1XX and XX1X would be displayed by this
   subcommand while members named X1X or MXX13X would not be displayed.

   Note that -A is added following a displayed member name if the
   member name is an alias.  The member name is listed in a combined
   hexadecimal/character format if it does not contain upper case
   alphanumeric characters (including @, $ and #) or if the first
   character is numeric.  Unprintable characters (for 3270-type
   devices) in a member name are displayed as periods.

               If member name is ALL, then all members of the input
               PDS will be expanded to members of an output PDS.

 output.data - specifies the name of the output data set.  Standard
               TSO dsname syntax should be used.  This should be a

  The RENAME subcommand updates a member's name.

  If a main load member is renamed, any associated alias directory
  entries will be updated to reflect the new base member name.

  Note: if a main load member is renamed to itself, any associated
  alias entries will be checked and updated as needed.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set. To ensure data set
  integrity, you should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of
  the data set update protection provided by the -PDS86- command for
  SHR allocations (for details, enter HELP UPDATE).

  curname   - specifies the current name of the member.

  newname   - specifies the new name for the member.  Note that this
              new name becomes the -PDS86- default member name.

))SWAP      - the members named are to exchange directory entries.
))NOSWAP    - no member name exchange is to be performed.
))GROUP     - specifies that a group rename is to be performed.  The
              range of names affected is defined by the first operand
              and the resulting member name is obtained by replacing
              the first characters of the member name by the second
              group of characters from the RENAME command.

              For example, if  RENAME IEB ABCD GROUP  were entered,
              all members beginning IEB... would be renamed to ABCD...
                1.  With the statement, RENAME IEB ABCD GROUP,
                    a member named IEB12 would be assigned the
                    name ABCD12
                2.  With the statement, RENAME IEB OX GROUP,
                    a member named IEB12 would be assigned the
                    name OX12

))NOGROUP   - only the member specifically identified is to be renamed.
))REPBY(rp) - rp specifies a replacement member for curname.
              For example, the following subcommand:

              is equivalent to the following two subcommands:
              RENAME ONE TWO
              RENAME NEWONE ONE
=REPLACE=REP=REPL=REPLA=REPLAC
)F  Example -     REPLACE mema:memb /before/after/ write

  The REPLACE subcommand changes portions of a member which contain a
  search string.  Only those portions of the member which contain the
  search string are displayed after a character string substitution.

  If the WRITE keyword is specified, the data is updated in-place;
  otherwise, only potential changes are listed.

  Unprintable characters for 3270-type devices are translated to
  periods before they are displayed.

  REPLACE formats are NUM, SNUM, NONUM, LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP;
  for load modules, the NUM, SNUM and NONUM formats are equivalent
  to the LDUMP format.

  The default format is initially NUM; however, each time a format
  operand is entered on a REPLACE, FIND or LIST subcommand, the value
  entered is used as the output format for subsequent REPLACE, FIND
  and LIST subcommands.  Also, note the following:
    A. Formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM limit the search and update length
       for logical records to 256 characters.
    B. Column 72 is not modified for formats NUM or SNUM if the record
       format is fixed with 80 character records.
    C. Formats BLOCK and DUMP apply to physical records; the other
       formats apply to logical records; and for load modules, LBLOCK
       and LDUMP formats update and display only CSECT data.
    D. Formats LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP display only the updated
       segments of a record which contained the search string; however,
       a following segment will also be displayed if the string spanned
       a segment boundary.
    E. Formats LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP require equal length
       search and replacement strings; formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM
       allow different length strings with string expansion (shifting
       the data over to multiple blanks) and string contraction
       (shifting the data from the next blank to the replacement data).

))OFFSET(Hx)  - for LBLOCK and LDUMP formats only; Hx may be entered
                as a 1 to six digit hexadecimal number to specify
                the module offset at which the search is to begin.

                If both MODULE AND OFFSET keywords are entered, the
                offset applies to each module selected.
))MODULE(Partm)-for LBLOCK or LDUMP formats only; Partm may be entered
                as a 1 to 8 byte partial external name to limit the
                CSECT or ENTRY names to be searched or updated to

=REPRO=REPR
)F  Example -     REPRO mem1:mem2 maxblk(2400)

  The REPRO subcommand rebuilds members.  It can also create new
  members based on existing members in the data set.

  If the TO (or the equivalent AS) keyword is used, each new member
  is named in a generic fashion.  For example, if TO(X12) is entered,
  each resulting member name is formed by placing X12 over the first
  three characters of the original member name.  An exception to this
  rule is made when only a single member is to be created and its
  aliases are not also requested; in this case, the member name is
  taken directly from the TO keyword.

  For load members, a null ZAP IDR record can be added when the

))ADDZAP     - for load members only, specifies that a ZAP IDR record
               is to be added (each ZAP IDR record contains space for
               19 historical entries).

               maximum output blocksize to be used when the members
               are reconstructed.
))TO(pname)  - pname defines the name of any output members.  For
               example, with TO(new) and the input members, AA, ABBA

=RESTORE=RES=REST=RESTO=RESTOR
)F  Example -     RESTORE oldname

  The RESTORE subcommand resurrects deleted members.  Deleted members
  remain in a partitioned data set until the data set is compressed.

  It may be possible to resurrect members which were deleted before
  compressing a data set if you mark all of the data set's space as
  in-use with a "FIXPDS MAXSPACE" statement before the restore attempt.

  The attributes authorized, not editable, not executable, only
  loadable, page boundary, reentrant, refreshable and reusable can
  not be determined from load module records; however, these attributes
  can be assigned based on a model member with the LIKE operand or they
  may be selectively assigned with the ATTRIB subcommand.

  If the data set is a load library, then if the member name is an
  imbedded external name within the load module, that external name
  will be used as the entry point; otherwise, the first CSECT in the
  load module will be used as the entry point.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set. To ensure data set
  integrity, you should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of
  the data set update protection provided by the -PDS86- command for

              This member name becomes the default member name.

))TTR(strt) - strt is one to six hexadecimal digits which provide the
              relative track address for the deleted member; or if
              REPEAT, DISPLAY or PROMPT are in effect, it specifies

              page aligned, reentrant, refreshable, reusable, RMODE,
              and SSI.
              For other members, a SSI value or ISPF statistics are
              to be set based on member XYZ.
))MODULE(p) - For load modules, p specifies a partial external name,
              which requires a match with a entry symbol or CSECT
              name in a deleted member.  If no module name match
              can be made, the member will not be displayed or
              resurrected.

              If the form MODULE(*) is used, the previous partial
              name entered on any MODULE keyword will be used.
))COUNT(nm) - Maximum number of informational lines to display from
              deleted members before prompting.
))FIND('s') - For any member, requires the presence of the specified
              character string in a deleted member.  If the string is
              not present in a deleted member, that member will not be
              displayed or resurrected.  The string may contain one to
              32 characters.  If the ASIS keyword is entered, the
              string will not be translated to upper case letters.
))CAPS      - For use with FIND, specifies that the FIND argument is

   The SMPGEN subcommand assists in creating SMP/E sysmods.  While
   only ++MAC, ++MACUPD, ++SRC, and ++SRCUPD statements are
   generated, SMP/E functions can be easily completed with an editor
   by using SMPGEN output as a basis for the sysmod.

   The SUBLIST subcommand forms member sublists.  When SUBLIST gains
   control, it forms a new member group using the individual member
   names passed to it; each -PDS86- subcommand which invokes SUBLIST
   defines a new member sublist.

   SUBLIST disregards duplicate member names.

   SUBLIST is useful for the THEN or ELSE keywords of the IF and FIND
   subcommands in that operands are not supported after the subcommand
   name; but if SUBLIST is used as the subcommand, a following
   subcommand (which uses * for the group name) may have any desired
   operands.

   Also, if multiple operations are to be performed to the same list
   of members, they can be organized as a single member group using

=SVC=SV
)F  Example -     SVC 109

   The SVC subcommand formats information regarding the SVC table.
   SVC's are extensions to the operating system which can be invoked
   to perform system tasks.  SVC's receive control in supervisor state
   and in the master storage protect key (key zero).  They have the
   power to alter otherwise protected storage areas or issue privileged
   instructions that cannot be issued directly from problem programs.

   If no SVC number is requested, a formatted list of all 256 SVC's is
   provided.  If a SVC number is specified, only that SVC is formatted.

   Type 1 SVC's cannot link to other routines and cannot issue other
   SVC's from within the routine.  They receive control with the local
   lock held and can obtain all other locks.  They reside in the system
   nucleus (IEANUC0x).

   Type 2 SVC's can link to other routines and can issue other SVC's
   themselves.  They require no locks but can issue them.  Like type 1
   SVC's, they reside in the system nucleus.

   Type 3/4 (3 or 4) SVC's can link to other routines and can issue
   other SVC's.  They require no locks but can issue them.  They reside
   in the Link Pack Area (LPA) or Modified Link Pack Area (MLPA).
   They can be loaded from any of the LPA libraries or alternatively,
   from SYS1.SVCLIB or SYS1.LINKLIB.

   Type 6 SVC's cannot link to other routines or issue other SVC's.
   They execute disabled, meaning that no other program can gain
   control within MVS during the execution of the SVC.  Locks cannot
   be held on entry to the SVC.  Like types 1 and 2, type 6 SVC's
   reside in the system nucleus.

   Four SVC's are ESR Router SVC's.  SVC 109 contains a SVCTABLE for
   type 3 or 4 ESR SVC's, SVC 116 contains a SVCTABLE for type 1 ESR
   SVC's, SVC 122 contains a SVCTABLE for type 2 ESR SVC's, and SVC 137
   contains a SVCTABLE for type 6 ESR SVC's.

   Note: This subcommand requires the MXI program.

=VERIFY=VE=VER=VERI=VERIF
)F  Example -     VERIFY mema:memb

 The VERIFY subcommand validity checks data sets.  For partitioned
 data sets, the entire data set may be checked by entering : in the
 member name position; an individual member or member group may be
 checked by entering its name in the member name position.

 VERIFY checks partitioned data sets in the following manner:
  A.  For VERIFY : UPDATE, a dummy member is added and deleted to
      determine if the data set directory is full and if normal PDS
      functions are possible.  Note that this is the only potential
      data set update performed by the VERIFY subcommand.
  B.  The data set directory is read, member names are placed into
      a program table in TTR sort order and the following checks
      are performed:
      1.  If NAME is in effect, member names are checked for validity.
      2.  If the data set is a load library and LKED is in effect,
          the following illegal editor attribute combinations are
          checked:
          a.  Modules with RENT and NOREUS attributes
          b.  Modules with RMODEANY and AMODE24 or AMODEANY attributes
          c.  Modules with OVLY and RENT, REUS, REFR, SCTR, RMODEANY,
              AMODE31, AMODE64, or AMODEANY attributes
          d.  Modules with TEST and NOEDIT attributes
          e.  Modules with REUS and SCTR attributes
      3.  If LOAD is in effect and the data set is a load library,
          each member is checked for ABENDs as it is LOADED.
      4.  Each member is checked for current usage by an ISPF EDIT
          session.
      5.  Member directory entries are checked for correct name order.
      6.  Each member's TTR address is checked against the end of
          the data set.
  C.  The program TTR table is checked for:
      1.  Orphan members (aliases with no associated main member).
      2.  Apparent alias members (main members whose start address
          matches another main member's start address).
      3.  Alias load modules whose directory pointers to associated
          main members are incorrect.
      4.  Alias load modules whose RMODE entries or main AMODE entries
          do not match their base module's entries.
  D.  If READ or INPUT is in effect, the directory and each member
      is read checking for:
      1.  Permanent I/O errors
      2.  Input blocksizes exceeding the MAXBLK value
          or if MAXBLK is omitted, the DCB BLKSIZE
      3.  Input blocksizes/LRECL not an integral if RECFM=F
      4.  Input LRECLs exceeding DCB LRECL if RECFM=V
      5.  Input LRECLs less than four bytes if RECFM=V
      6.  Null members
      7.  Directory RLD/CONTROL counts for modules linked since
          OS/VS which do not match the first RLD entry
  E.  Informational messages regarding the data set are provided.

 The VERIFY subcommand validity checks sequential data sets in the
 following manner:
  A.  The data set is checked for current usage by an ISPF EDIT session.
  B.  If READ or INPUT is in effect, the data set is read checking for:
      1.  Permanent I/O errors
      2.  Input blocksizes exceeding the MAXBLK value
          or if MAXBLK is omitted, the DCB BLKSIZE
      3.  Input blocksizes/LRECL not an integral if RECFM=F
      4.  Input LRECLs exceeding DCB LRECL if RECFM=V

 The VPDSE subcommand invokes the IBM utility IEBPDSE (z/OS 1.13)
 to verify the directory structure of a PDSE dataset.

 IEBPDSE returns a code in register 15 to indicate the results of
 program execution.  The return codes and their meanings are:

 Codes      Meaning
 00 (X'00') Successful completion.
 04 (X'04') The input PDSE is slightly damaged. Processing continues.

 This return code describes data sets that can be opened normally but
 but have some form of corruption. Currently, the only instance of a
 "slightly" damage damaged PDSE is when the free space list marks free
 pages as used, wasting space that could normally be reclaimed. This
 does not prevent the user from opening the PDSE but the user should
 copy the PDSE to a new data set.

         conform to DSNAME standards.
))CAT    - A locate is done for each DSNAME on the volumes listed
           and status is indicated.  Note: this option uses a
           considerable amount of processing time.
             C -  cataloged on this volume
             N -  not cataloged
             W -  cataloged on another volume
             E -  catalog processing error
))ENQ    - A test is performed for an ENQ with a major name of
           SYSDSN and a minor name of the dataset name to find out
           if the dataset is in use. If the dataset is VSAM the cluster
           name is located and used for the ENQ test.
           Note - this option uses a lot of processing time.
             N -  not enqueued
             S -  allocated with DISP=SHR
             E -  exclusively allocated
             ? -  catalog processing error
             * -  enqueue processing error
))TRK    -  space is to be reported in track units.

))KB     -  space is to be reported in kilobyte units.
))MB     -  space is to be reported in megabyte units.
))NOSORT -  the data sets are not sorted.  They are output as they
              are found.
))SORT(sortfields) -
              data sets are sorted into alphabetical order,
              based upon the sort fields specified.
              DSNAME,VOLUME,ALLOC,USED,UNUSED,PCT,EX,DSO,RFM,
              LRECL,BLKSZ,CDATE,EXPDT,REFDT are valid sort fields.
              A/D  is required after each sort field to indicate
              ascending/descending sequence.
))BREAK(breakchars) -
              the listing will contain a new header, (on a new page
              if the VTOCOUT DD card option is used), whenever the
              specified number of characters differs from the
              preceding data set.  This option functions only with
              the SORT option.
))CHARS(charsperline) -
              specifies the number of characters on each
              line of output.  The default is 150 for print and the
              linesize of the terminal for tso sessions.
              You can get more information by specifying a larger
              number of characters per line or you can limit the
              printing by setting a smaller number of characters
              per line of output.
))LINES(linesperpage) -
              specifies the number of lines before a new title line is
              produced.  It defaults to 60 for print and to the screen
              size for TSO sessions.
))NOHEADING - do not produce a heading.  The heading will only be
              output if the VTOCOUT DD statement is present.
))HEADING(text) -
              if a DD statement with a DDNAME of VTOCOUT is present,
              this text will be used to begin every page.  Carriage
              control should be included (ASA).  The default header
              consists of VTOC command version 02 and the command that
              was entered.
))DSNLEN(length) -
              specifies the length of the DSNAME to print.  the rest of
              the DSNAME is truncated.  The CHARS parameter will also
              cause the DSNAME to be truncated, if the name and the
              preceding information exceeds the print line.
))NOPRINT   - specifies that individual items are not to be listed.
              The command can be used to calculate totals.
))PRINT(printop (printitemlist)) -
              specifies the items to print.  the printop is the
              operation to be performed as follows:
                NEW - the printitemlist is a complete list of what
                      to print.
                REP - the first printitem will be replaced with the
                      rest of the items on the list.
                ADD - the rest of the printitemlist will be added
                      after the first item on the list.
                DEL - the items on the printitemlist will not be
                      printed.

              The printitemlist names are the same keywords used
              in LIM, AND, and OR functions and are also the titles
              as printed.  These keywords can be ALLOC, UNUSED, USED,
              PCT, EX, DSO, RFM, BLKSZ, LRECL, CDATE, EXPDT, REFDT,
              SECT, PASS, ROUND, CCHH, VOLUME, UNIT, DSNAME, ACTION,
              TYPE, RACF or UPD.

              The ADD, DEL, and REP print operations refer to the
              default print list.  The default list is ALLOC, UNUSED,
              PCT, EX, DSO, RFM, BLKSZ, LRECL, REFDT, CDATE, VOLUME,
              DSNAME, EXPDT, SECQ, SECT, ROUND, PASS, ACTION, and
              type.  As noted under CHARS above, only the items that
              will fit on the print line will be listed.
))LIMIT(keyword oper value) -
              specifies which data sets are to be listed.  only data
              sets that satisfy the relation are listed.

              keyword can be ALLOC, UNUSED, USED, PCT, EX, DSO, RFM,
              BLKSZ, LRECL, CDATE, EXPDT, REFDT, SECT, PASS, ROUND,
              CCHH, VOLUME, UNIT, DSNAME, ACTION, TYPE, RACF or UPD.

              oper can be EQ, NE, LE, LT, GE or GT.

              value can be a comparison value such as FB, PS, R or
              a number like 51.

=ZAP=ZA=Z
)F  Example -     ZAP

  The ZAP command is used to examine, dump, and modify any type of
  sequential, partitioned, or direct access dataset.  Any RECFM is
  accepted.  This command is the TSO interactive equivalent of
  IBM's service aid 'IMASPZAP' or 'SUPERZAP'.

  *** NOTE:  Not for PDSE datasets.  Use AMASPZAP instead. ***

  General Info:

  Operands are entered immediately after the command, with no
  intervening blanks.

  The block is read into a work buffer, where you modify it.  When
  you enter the "ZAP" command, the block is written back to the
  dataset from the buffer.  If any other job or user has updated that
  block in between when you first displayed it and when you "zapped"
  it, the other changes will be lost.

  If you make changes to a block, to go to another block you must
  either "ZAP" the block (re-write it to the dataset), or enter the
  command twice in a row which will cause you to leave the current
  modified block.

 operands; if you enter LISTA without operands you are switched
 from your current display to a LISTA display.  Line commands
 (chan, dcat, free, log, o and x) are also supported.

 The first LISTA panel shows basic allocation information such as
 DDNAME, data set TYPE, Open count (under the header OP), VOLUME
 allocated, MEMBER name and DSNAME.  Command error messages are
 provided under the DATA header as follows:

 PDS/TSO Command Table (ISPMODE only)

 This display provides for a list of commands that can be defined
 by the user.  The commands may be for PDS or TSO.   PDS commands
 may be any command that can be entered from the View log function.
 The TSO commands are passed to ISPF through the "SELECT CMD" service
 and thus can support any IBM or user TSO command or CLIST.
 Any entry in the list can be marked as a comment line.   The type
 of command is controlled by setting the TYPE field on each entry as
 follows:

    P = PDS command
    - = TSO command or CLIST
      = TSO command or CLIST
    * = comment
    T = Trap TSO command output

 The TCT panel provides for 3 changeable fields and one information
 field:

 The OPT field is set by the user for the operation option desired.

 The MSG/RC field provides information on the last action for that line
 or the return code from the last TSO command.

 The TYPE field is set to the user to "P" for PDS commands,"*" for a
 comment, a blank or dash is for a TSO command or CLIST, or a "T"
 for Trapping the output from a TSO command.

 The COMMAND data field is filled in by the user with the actual command

 If the TYPE field or COMMAND data field is changed and the OPT field
 is blank, a "SELECT" option is assumed.
=SHOW=SHO=SH

=SHA=CHECKSUM=HASH
)F Function -
  SHA-n (Secure Hash Algorithm n) is a set of cryptographic hash
  functions designed by the United States National Security Agency
  (NSA).

  Cryptographic hash functions are mathematical operations run on
  digital data; by comparing the computed "hash" (the output from
  execution of the algorithm) to a known and expected hash value,
  a person can determine the data's integrity.

  SHA-1 Family:
    The SHA1SUM command displays the SHA-1 hash of data sets.
  SHA-2 Family:
    The SHA224S command displays the SHA-224 hash of data sets.
    The SHA2SUM command displays the SHA-256 hash of data sets.
    The SHA3SUM command displays the SHA-384 hash of data sets.
    The SHA5SUM command displays the SHA-512 hash of data sets.
  SHA-3 Family:
    No implementation as a TSO command.

  In data sets with variable-length records the rdw's and sdw's are
  not included when the checksum is computed unless the rdw keyword
  is specified.

)X Syntax -
         command  'dslist'  file  lower  rdw  brief  multi  quick

  Required - command (SHA1SUM, SHA224S, SHA2SUM, SHA3SUM or SHA5SUM)
             'dslist'
  Defaults - none

)O Operands -
  'dslist' - Names of sequential data sets or members of partitioned
             data sets. If more than one, enclose list in parentheses.

))FILE     - The names in dslist are ddnames, not dsnames.
))LOWER    - Display the results in lower case.
))RDW      - Include rdw or sdw in variable length records.
))BRIEF    - Display only the hash, without the data set name.
))MULTI    - Display the hash and data set name on separate lines.
))QUICK    - For unquoted dsnames, bypass the default service routine.
             So for example, if you specify the name temp and you
             only have a data set named temp.data, it won't be found
             if quick is also specified. The quick keyword is just
             to cut out the overhead of looking for extensions at
             the end of the specified data set name.
=TIPS=TRICKS=GEEKS=DUMMIES
)F FUNCTION -
 This section is provided for the mainframe geek seeking to keep
 the saw sharp.

 Tips and Tricks:

 o  Expand a PDS directory without reorganizing
      fixpds expand(10)
      ... the PDS directory is expanded with 10 more blocks

 o  Use PDS under TSSO for emergency situations
      #pds 'sys1.proclib' list net
      ... the VTAM net proc is listed out on the console.
      #pds 'sys1.proclib' replace net 'oldstring' 'newstring' write
      ... PDS command changes the member.

 o  Search and replace strings across any members of a PDS
      replace s2k: 'dsn=s2k.load' 'dsn=s2k.load2' write
      ... System 2000 JCL procs are updated with a new load library

 o  Change RECFM, LRECL, and BLKSIZE values without reorganizing
      fixpds recfm(u) lrecl(80) blksize(80)
      ... recfm(f) doc file changed to undefined before copy to loadlib

 o  Generate a list of previously deleted members
      restore xxxx repeat noprompt display find('sysout=t') TEST
      ... a list of deleted members is displayed but not restored

=ABEND=ABEN=ESTAE=ESTAI=STAE
)F FUNCTION -
 The ABEND HELP entry is provided to explain ABEND processing
 performed by -PDS86-. -PDS86- attempts to recover from ABENDs with
 its ESTAE and ESTAI recovery routines unless CONTROL NORECOVER is
 in effect.

 In the following, the ABEND processing provided by -PDS86- is
 described in more detail:

  A.  The -PDS86- program uses different recovery methods depending
      on the subcommand being executed.  The method used should
      perform any cleanup and initialization functions required to
      restart -PDS86-.

  B.  For internal -PDS86- subcommands, recovery is performed by
      writing an error message and terminating the subcommand.

  C.  For the external subcommands BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, or VIEW,
      no ESTAE recovery is attempted.

  D.  For the other external -PDS86- subcommands (COMPARE, COMPRESS,
      COPY, DCF, DSPRINT, EXEC, FSE, HELP, PRINTOFF, REVIEW, SUBMIT,
      TSO xxx, TSOEDIT, TSOLIST and VPSPRINT), the subcommand
      processor is forcibly detached.

  E.  If CONTROL NORECOVER is in effect, -PDS86- will terminate unless
      the subcommand being used specifically tests for ABEND conditions
      (such as IF with LOADERR or VERIFY with LOAD).

  F.  If CONTROL RECOVER is in effect, any ABEND dump will probably
      not be very useful; also, if you want to use TSO TEST after an
      ABEND, it is recommended that you set CONTROL NORECOVER first.

  G.  Certain external programs reached via the TSO subcommand (such
      as CALL) will terminate -PDS86- with a "READY" message if the
      program they invoke ABENDs.  Note, however, that if a null line
      is entered at this point, -PDS86- will regain control.

  H.  The PDS999E message should identify the name of the -PDS86-
      assembly listing involved in the error as follows:
        1. PDSMAIN - ABEND in the PDS mainline
        2. PARSE   - ABEND in the PARSE interface
        3. ISPDSPY - ABEND in the ISPF Dialog routines
        4. VSUBCMD - ABEND in the subcommand check

=ATTN=PA1=ATTE=ATTEN=ATTENT=ATTENTI=ATTENTIO
)F FUNCTION -
 The ATTN HELP entry is provided to explain the attention processing
 performed by -PDS86-. In general, an attention (the PA1 key) may be
 used to terminate the current -PDS86- subcommand and two attentions
 in a row may be used to terminate the -PDS86- command.

 In the following, the attention processing provided by -PDS86- is
 described in more detail:

  A.  A single (double for TSOEDIT) attention should terminate any
      member group in progress (except for the FSE subcommand).

  B.  An attention at a prompt for a data set should terminate -PDS86-.

  C.  An attention at the normal ENTER OPTION subcommand prompt
      should provide another ENTER OPTION prompt; another attention
      at this point should terminate -PDS86-.

  D.  For subcommands BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE, MEMLIST, or VIEW,
      no ENTER OPTION prompt is provided by -PDS86-'s attention
      handling:
       1.  A single attention should terminate any member group in
           progress.
       2.  An attention during a edit or browse line command from
           MEMLIST will terminate any remaining line commands.
       3.  Any additional attentions should be ignored by -PDS86-.
       4.  For TSO commands invoked by ISPF with no attention
           handling:  the first attention is noted by -PDS86- and it
           will terminate any member group in progress; subsequent
           attentions apply only to the TSO command.

  E.  For the COMPRESS or COPY subcommands, attentions are ignored
      until the attached program terminates to protect the integrity
      of the target data set.

      Note that if IKJEFTSR is used to authorize IEBCOPY for the
      compress or copy, attention interrupts cannot be deferred;
      thus, it is recommended that the attention key not be used
      (a successful attention may destroy the data set).

  F.  For other -PDS86- subcommands, a single (double for TSOEDIT)
      attention should result in an ENTER OPTION prompt; the
      processing action taken at this point depends on what is
      entered next:
       1.  Another attention should terminate the -PDS86- command.
       2.  A null line should cause the interrupted subcommand to
           continue at the point of interruption.  Note: any messages
           awaiting output at the time of the interrupt will be lost.
       3.  If a subcommand is entered and the currently executing
           subcommand is external to -PDS86- (COMPARE, DCF, DSPRINT,
           EXEC, FSE, HELP, PRINTOFF, REVIEW, SUBMIT, TSO xxx, TSOEDIT,
           TSOLIST or VPSPRINT), the command processor should be
           forcibly detached and the ABEND message should be
           suppressed.
       4.  An entered subcommand should be given control without delay.

  G.  If an internal -PDS86- subcommand is in a loop that does not
      involve input or output to the terminal or input from the current
      data set, a single attention will not terminate the loop:
       1.  The first attention will provide the normal ENTER OPTION
           prompt.
       2.  If a subcommand is entered at this time, -PDS86- will
           continue looping.
       3.  Another attention will produce the message
           "THE PROGRAM IS PROBABLY IN A LOOP" and -PDS86- will perform
           the subcommand entered at the ENTER OPTION prompt.

=DEFINE=DEF=DEFI=DEFIN=GLOSSARY=GLOSS=GLOS
)F FUNCTION -
 The DEFINE HELP entry is provided to explain terminology used
 in the -PDS86- program and in its documentation:

 Alias member -  a directory entry with a indicator value which
 indicates that the member entry is an alternate name for another
 main member; a main member and its aliases are associated with
 the same recorded data in the PDS.

 Apparent alias member -  data in a partitioned data set which is
 pointed to by more than one main PDS directory entry.

 Associated members -  members with the same TTR address.  For a main
 member, the associated members could be alias members or an apparent
 alias member; for an alias member, the associated members could be
 other aliases or a main member.

 Batch mode -  a mode of -PDS86- operation. In batch mode, all user
 communication is performed with PUTGET, GETLINE and PUTLINE TSO
 services.  No ISPF services are available.  In this mode of
 operation, -PDS86- operates under control of the batch Terminal
 Monitor Program (the TMP, or IKJEFT01).  You can include comments
 in a PDS subcommand anywhere a blank might appear.  To include a
 comment start with delimiter /*. If you want to continue a PDS
 subcommand after the comment, close the comment with delimiter */.

 BLDL -  a BPAM function which is used to check for the existence of
 members.

 BPAM -  an acronym for Basic Partitioned Access Method; BPAM is
 actually very similar in use to BSAM which is for sequential data.
 -PDS86- often uses BPAM for member check operations and always uses
 BPAM for directory updates and reading PDSE data sets.

 BSAM -  an acronym for Basic Sequential Access Method; -PDS86- uses
 BSAM for several utility functions.

 CCHHR -  an acronym for Cylinder, Cylinder, Head, Head, Record which
 is a 10 digit hexadecimal disk address relative to the start of the
 volume.

 Command -  a request for an operation.  For example, -PDS86- is a
 command and XMIT is a -PDS86- subcommand.   The distinction between
 a command and a subcommand is not often important.

 Compress -  a process which removes deleted members from a PDS.  Disk
 space formerly occupied by these deleted members is made available
 for new members.  In a PDSE data set, space from deleted members is
 managed dynamically; you can not compress a PDSE.

 Deleted member -  member data which is not pointed to by any
 directory entry; deleted members remain in a PDS until the
 data set is compressed.

 DS1LSTAR -  a pointer in the data set control block (DSCB) which
 indicates the last used disk address for a data set.  This pointer is
 updated after a member is added to a PDS data set; it is also
 adjusted after a PDS is compressed.

 EXCP -  an acronym for EXecute Channel Program.  This access method is
 used extensively by -PDS86- for its read and write operations.

 ISPMODE -  a mode of -PDS86- operation. With ISPMODE, -PDS86-
 operates as an ISPF dialog and normal ISPF services (HELP, TSO,
 SPLIT, SWAP,...) are available and all -PDS86- services are
 available as well.

 Line command -  a command entered on a table line in the CMD field.
 In -PDS86-, line commands may be up to four characters long.
 In addition, up to eight additional operand bytes may be entered to
 the right of a member name in the DATA field.

 Line mode -  a mode of -PDS86- operation. In line mode, all user
 communication is performed with PUTGET, GETLINE and PUTLINE TSO
 services.  No ISPF services are available.

 Load library -  a partitioned data set which has record format U
 and is commonly used to contain executable modules.

 Load module -  a member contained in a load library.

 Main member -  a non-alias directory entry and its associated
 recorded data.

 Member -  data in a partitioned data set (or PDS) which is pointed
 to by one or more PDS directory entries.

 Orphan member -  an member marked as an alias which does not have
 an associated main member.

 PDB or PDS-determined blocksize - a block size determined by the
 FIXPDS BLKSIZE(99999) subcommand.  PDB's are half-track block sizes.

 PDS or Partitioned Data Set -  a data set with fixed, variable or
 undefined format which is commonly used as a "library" for related
 types of information.  Partitioned data sets contain two segments
 of data: a directory of information and member data.

 PDSE or Partitioned Data Set Extended -  a data set with fixed,
 variable or undefined format which is commonly used as a "library"
 for related types of information.  PDSE data sets contain two
 segments of data: a directory of information and member data.  Member
 data and directory entries are stored in 4096-byte blocks on the
 device.  This type of library is requested as DSNTYPE(LIBRARY) in JCL
 or on an ALLOCATE command.  A PDSE must be accessed by BPAM or BSAM
 access methods; SMS provides a virtual data set which looks like a
 PDS.  A PDSE can have up to 123 extents and cannot extend beyond
 one volume.

 PDS directory -  a segment of a PDS which is a sequential data set
 with eight byte keys and 256 byte data records containing pointers
 to data in the PDS member portion of the data set.

 PDSE directory -  the directory is indexed, permitting more direct
 searches for members.  The name and the relative track address of a
 member are used as keys to search for members. The PDSE directory is
 expandable; you can keep adding entries up to the directory size limit
 or until the data set runs out of space. The PDSE directory can extend
 into secondary space.  The limit for the number of members in a PDSE
 directory is 522,236.

 PDS member data -  a segment of a PDS which contains current members
 (which are pointed to by one or more directory entries) and inactive
 or deleted members (which have no associated directory entries).

 PDSE member data -  a member is allocated in full page increments.  A
 member is maintained on full page boundaries, and any remaining space
 in the page is unused.  Space from deleted members is managed
 dynamically; you can not restore deleted members or compress a PDSE.
 PDSE members can contain a maximum number of 15,728,639 logical
 records.  The limit increases in PDSE Version 2 to 2,146,435,071
 logical records.

 PDS directory entry -  a logical entry in a PDS directory which points
 to its associated data in the member data; it consists of an eight
 character member name field and at least one three byte relative
 address (TTR) field.

 PDSE directory entry -  a logical entry in a PDSE directory which
 points to its associated data in the member data; it consists of a
 member name or an alias, the starting location of the member within
 the data set and optionally user data.  The directory entries are
 arranged by name in alphanumeric collating sequence.  The name and the
 relative track address of a PDSE member are used as keys to search for
 members.  The TTRs are not relative track and record numbers but
 rather pseudo randomly generated aliases for the PDSE member.

 PDSE V2 member generations - allows you to reverse or access
 recent changes to a member.  It also allows you to retain multiple
 generations of a member for archival reasons.  Member generations
 is similar to generations for data sets.  There's no need to fear,
 PDSEGEN® is here!  Critically acclaimed by Dr. Harold Twain Weck,
 Institute for Backup Trauma Director.

 PDSPAIN -  1988 PDSPAIN committee report to SHARE. The committee
 presented its report in Session 0232 at Share 70 in Anaheim.
 This is the MVS GROUP Position Addressing the need for Functional
 Enhancement to OS/MVS Partitioned Data Sets. The PDSPAIN committee
 was formed by the Storage Management Project of the Operating Systems
 Support Division of SHARE to study problems associated with
 OS partitioned data sets.  IBM responded with the PDSE format.

 Primary command -  a subcommand or command entered from the command
 line of a panel.

 Program fetch -  a program that prepares programs for execution
 by loading them at specific storage locations and readjusting each
 relocatable address constant.

 QSAM -  an acronym for Queued Sequential Access Method; -PDS86- uses
 QSAM to read PDSE directories and for several utility functions.

 Source library -  a PDS or PDSE data set which has fixed or variable
 format data; source libraries are normally used to contain
 non-executable data.

 Source member -  a member contained in a source library.

 Subcommand -  a request for an operation that is within the scope of
 work requested by the previously issued command.  -PDS86- is a
 command; XMIT is a -PDS86- subcommand. The distinction between a
 subcommand and a command is not often important.

 The PDS Command -  a TSO command processor and ISPF dialog program
 package.  There are possibly 1,000 separate dataset manipulation
 functions built into this package, and it is something that no systems
 programmer can afford to be without, period.

 TTR -  an acronym for Track, Track, Record which is a 6 digit
 hexadecimal disk address relative to the start of the data set; this
 type of address is stored in the member directory entry to indicate
 the starting address of a member.

=DIALOG=DIA=DIAL=DIALO
)F FUNCTION -
  The DIALOG HELP entry is provided to explain the processing
  relationships of ISPF and the -PDS86- subcommands which use ISPF
  dialog services.

  Note: the OUTCOPY subcommand and the CONTROL SYSOUT/DSNAME operands
  do not use ISPF services; however, when they are first entered, they
  attempt to establish an ISPF environment so that ISPF services can be
  utilized by subsequent -PDS86- subcommands; the BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF,
  ISPMODE, MEMLIST and VIEW subcommands do require ISPF services.


  -PDS86- is a TSO command processor and can gain control in any of
  the following modes:

  A.  From READY mode:
      When the first subcommand utilizing or initializing ISPF services
      is entered, -PDS86- calls an ISPF interface which invokes -PDS86-
      recursively as an ISPF dialog; ISPF services are then directly
      invoked for each subsequent BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE, MEMLIST,
      or VIEW subcommand.

  B.  From ISPF option 6, the TSO subcommand of ISPF, or as a line
      command from option 3.4:
      ISPF services can be used without restrictions.

  C.  From another TSO command processor:
      If an ISPF environment has been established by an earlier command
      processor, ISPF services can not be used; otherwise, when the
      first subcommand utilizing or initializing ISPF services is
      entered, -PDS86- calls an ISPF interface which invokes -PDS86-
      recursively as an ISPF dialog; ISPF services are then directly
      invoked for each subsequent BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE, MEMLIST,
      or VIEW subcommand.

  D.  From the PDS@PRIM panel in ISPF:
      -PDS86- is invoked as an ISPF dialog; -PDS86- locates and
      creates the required command processor control blocks and can
      invoke ISPF services directly.

=GROUPS=G=GR=GRO=GROU=GROUP
)F FUNCTION -
  The GROUP HELP entry is provided to explain the various member
  name forms allowed.  Member names may be entered in either character
  or hexadecimal mode for any subcommand which processes member names.

  Character member names may be from one to eight bytes long with no
  imbedded blanks, commas, parentheses, colons or slashes.

  Hexadecimal member names may contain from one to sixteen hexadecimal
  digits delimited by x' and '.  X'd7c4e2f9' and PDS9 are entirely
  equivalent; also, x'333' and x'0333' are equivalent.

  Subcommands AMBLIST, ATTRIB, BROWSE, COBANAL, COPY, DCF, DELETE,
  DIRENTRY, DSPRINT, EDIT, FIND, FSE, IF, HISTORY, LIST, LMA, MAP,
  MEMBERS, MEMLIST, OFFLOAD, OUTCOPY, PRINTOFF, REPLACE, REPRO, REVIEW,
  SMPGEN, SRCHFOR, SUBMIT, SUBLIST, TSOEDIT, TSOLIST, VIEW, VERIFY,
  VPSPRINT, and XMIT allow additional member name specifications.

  A member name range, member name pattern or member name combination
  forms what is termed a member group.  Note that a member list (that
  is, a parenthesized list containing member and member group
  specifications separated by commas) may also be used.

  When a member group is being processed, the subcommand processing
  routine is re-executed for each member in the group.  Specifically,
  note the following:

  A.  Default member name -- if no member name is specified, the
      last member name or member group entered for any of the above
      subcommands will be assumed.

  B.  Asterisk member name -- if * is entered in the member name
      position, the last member name or member group entered for
      any of the above subcommands will be assumed.

  C.  Member name range -- any of these subcommands may select all
      members in a range by specifying a beginning partial member
      name, a colon, and a ending partial member name (either or
      both of the partial names may be null).

      Logic from the DISPLAY subcommand is used to select members;
      the subcommand processes these selected members in alphabetic
      order.  The following specifications would select the same
      member names:
            subcommand  :            and   DISPLAY
            subcommand  part1:       and   DISPLAY  part1
            subcommand  :part2       and   DISPLAY  x'00' part2
            subcommand  part1:part2  and   DISPLAY  part1 part2

  D.  Member name pattern -- any of these subcommands may select all
      members whose names contain pattern characters by specifying a
      member name segment, a slash, and another member name segment
      (either, not both, of the member name segments may be null).

      Logic from the PATTERN subcommand is used to select members;
      the subcommand processes these selected members in alphabetic
      order.  The following specifications would select the same
      member names:
            subcommand  seg1/        and   PATTERN  seg1
            subcommand  /seg2        and   PATTERN  seg2
            subcommand  seg1/seg2    and   PATTERN  seg1 seg2

  E.  Member name combination -- any of these subcommands may select
      all members whose names contain a range of names and a pattern
      of characters by specifying a member name segment, an asterisk
      and another member name segment (either, not both, of the
      member name segments may be null).

      Logic from the PATTERN subcommand is used to select members;
      the subcommand processes these selected members in alphabetic
      order.  The following specifications would select the same
      member names:
            subcommand  seg1*        and   DISPLAY  seg1 seg1
            subcommand  *seg2        and   PATTERN  seg2
            subcommand  seg1*seg2    and   DISPLAY  seg1 seg1 --with--
                                                    PATTERN  seg2

  F.  Member name display subcommands -- MEMBERS, PATTERN and DISPLAY
      allow the display of member groups using the above member group
      syntax; however, these subcommands differ as follows:
       1.  DISPLAY -- can not modify the current member group;
           if no member specification is entered, the entire
           member directory is displayed.
       2.  PATTERN -- can not modify the current member group;
           if no member specification is entered, the member group
           last entered on a PATTERN subcommand is displayed.
       3.  MEMBERS -- can modify the current member group;
           if no member specification is entered, the current
           member group is displayed.

  G.  Following are examples using the MEMBERS subcommand to
      define and display a member group:

        SUBCOMMAND         MEMBERS IN THE GROUP

)F FUNCTION -
 The LIMITS HELP entry is provided to list -PDS86- limitations
 which might impact the program's usefulness at an installation:

   1.  In the ISPMODE or MEMLIST panels, a maximum of 48 characters
       may be entered as a subcommand; otherwise, a maximum of 256
       characters may be entered.

       You can avoid the 48 characters restriction by ending a
       ISPMODE or MEMLIST subcommand with a plus (+) character and a
       continuation panel will be presented with the data you already
       entered to allow you to enter the rest of the subcommand.

   2.  For ISPMODE panels, only the first 79 characters of an output
       line are available for display; this is a consideration for
       the LIST and FIND subcommands with output formats NUM, SNUM
       and NONUM.

       Note:  If the &LOGWIDE global variable is set to 'YES' then
       the screen width of ISPMODE Log panel 1 will be set to the
       length of ZSCREENW.  Thus, up to 158 characters of an output
       line are available for display depending on the terminal width.

   3.  For session outputs via CONTROL DSNAME or SYSOUT, only the
       first 80 characters of an output line are retained if
       allocated with RECFM=FB and LRECL=80; this is also a
       consideration for the LIST and FIND subcommands with output
       formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM.  If the CONTROL DSNAME(dsname)
       data set is pre-allocated with RECFM=VB, any LRECL can
       be used; a maximum of 256 characters of an output line are
       retained.

   4.  For MEMLIST panels, only eight bytes of operand information
       may be entered as an operand in a line command after the
       member name.

   5.  For subcommands FIND and IF, the THEN and ELSE keywords may
       contain only a subcommand name (operands are not permitted).
       As a consequence, only the default action for the named
       subcommand may be performed using the current member.

       However, if you construct a member list subset using the
       SUBLIST keyword after THEN or ELSE in FIND or IF, any desired
       subcommands can be performed on the subset of members selected
       in a subsequent subcommand using * for the group name.

       For example,

         if a:z sctr noalias then(sublist)
         map * relink

   6.  XMIT is limited to 3620 members unless all members are specified.
       The member group to be transmitted can not be larger than 3620
       members.  All members (:) can be transmitted without limits.
       The IKJEFTSR command buffer length limit is 32K.

       For example,

         xmit *    to.sam outda(bin)  <--- limited to 3620 members
         xmit p86: to.sam outda(bin)  <--- limited to 3620 members
         xmit :    to.sam outda(bin)  <--- all members

=UPDATE=UP=UPD=UPDA=UPDAT=SHR=SH
)F FUNCTION -
 The UPDATE HELP entry is provided to explain the update data
 set protection implemented for certain -PDS86- subcommands.

 If the data set is allocated as OLD, the STOW DCB is left open after
 the first data set update.  For OLD allocations, exclusive use of the
 data set is assured and the following does not apply.

 If the data set is allocated as SHR (SHR was specifically requested
 or SHR was defaulted to), -PDS86- subcommands which update the
 data set such as ALIAS, ATTRIB (with attributes to be changed),
 COPY (for the output data set only), DELETE, FIXPDS, RENAME, REPRO,
 RESTORE or VERIFY could cause data set integrity problems if the
 data set is also being updated by another user.

 To circumvent this problem, -PDS86- uses the following ISPF RESERVE
 logic to maintain data set integrity during data set updates.

  A.  A  RESERVE  (SPFEDIT,DSNAME,E,44,SYSTEMS),UCB=ADDRESS
      is performed.

  B.  If the data set is a load library, then a linkage editor
      RESERVE or ENQUEUE is performed as appropriate:
       1.  On a shared DASD volume,
           RESERVE  (SYSIEWLP,DSNAME,E,44,SYSTEMS),UCB=ADDRESS
       2.  On a non-shared DASD volume,
           ENQ  (SYSIEWLP,DSNAME,E,44,SYSTEM)

  C.  The data set STOW DCB is opened

  D.  All data set updates are performed.
       1.  Wherever possible, the STOW DCB is left open while
           an entire member group is being processed.
       2.  For executions of -PDS86- in batch mode, the volume
           reserve is maintained and the STOW DCB is left open
           following the first update to the data set.

  E.  The data set STOW DCB is closed

  F.  DEQ's are performed to remove the RESERVE's and ENQ's

 SYSPLEX note:  MVS (since DFP 2.3, circa 1987) ensures that
 only one program in the sysplex can open a PDS with
 the OUTPUT option, even if you specify DISP=SHR.

 If a second program issues OPEN with the OUTPUT
 option, for the PDS with DISP=SHR, while a DCB is
 still open with the OUTPUT option, the second program
 will get a 213-30 ABEND.

 <Bruce Black, Innovation DP>
 PDS sharing was addressed by introducing new ENQ's.  The major name is
 SYSZDSCB.  The minor name consists of the dsn, volser, and access type
 (read or write).  The read ENQs are shared, the write is exclusive, so
 only one job (even cross-system) can update the PDS at any one time.

))PDS031I INPUT BUFFERING: type
   This message lists the current input buffering mode:
     BPAM      - Read using a BPAM DCB for PDSE data sets.  BPAM is
                 forced for a PDSE and a BPAM DCB is used.
     SINGLE    - Read single (each read obtains one physical block).
     DOUBLE    - Read double (each read obtains two physical blocks).
     MULTIPLE  - Read multiple (each read obtains an entire track).

   Note that the buffering type is reset for each data set allocated
   according to the device type on which the data set resides.  In
   general, MULTIPLE is used for device types which support the READ
   MULTIPLE CCW and DOUBLE is used otherwise.

))PDS032I TESTCPULOOP -- CPU LOOP FOLLOWS:
   CONTROL TESTCPULOOP - performs a CPU loop for program testing.

))PDS033I TESTABEND -- SYSTEM 0C1 FOLLOWS:

   CONTROL TESTOUTLOOP - performs an output loop for program testing.

))PDS035I TESTREAD -- EXCP RETURN CODE=nn; NEXT TTR ADDRESS IS ttraddr
   CONTROL TESTREAD -- verifies the operation of the input EXCP routine
   by using an initial TTR of 000001 in each case.

   EXCP is called for each of the buffering modes:
     SINGLE    - Read single (each read obtains one physical block).
                 The return code should be 00 and NEXT TTR ADDRESS
                 should be 000002 if sufficient data is available.
     DOUBLE    - Read double (each read obtains two physical blocks).
                 The return code should be 00 and NEXT TTR ADDRESS
                 should be 000003 if sufficient data is available.
     MULTIPLE  - Read multiple (each read obtains an entire track).
                 If the disk unit supports the READ MULTIPLE CCW, the
                 return code should be 00 and NEXT TTR ADDRESS
                 should be 000101 if sufficient data is available.

                 If this disk unit does not support the READ MULTIPLE
                 CCW, a PDS892E message should be received, the return
                 code should be 00 and NEXT TTR ADDRESS should be
                 000003 (double buffering is actually used).

   Return codes from EXCP have the following meanings:
        RC=00    Successful read
        RC=04    End of member
        RC=08    End of data set
        RC=12    I/O error

))PDS400W NO MEMBERS ARE IN THE DATA SET
   This data set has no member names in its directory.

))PDS410W VOLSET(volname) IS STILL IN EFFECT
   The displayed default volume name will be used unless a VOLUME
   parameter is also entered.

))PDS412W REALLOCATION WITHOUT VOLSET WILL BE ATTEMPTED
   The allocation attempt failed; -PDS86- will attempt reallocation
   without the VOLSET parameter assuming that you really wanted a
   cataloged data set.  If this is not the case, you will have to
   enter another change command for the correct data set.

))PDS441W name (WEAK)
   This external name is a weak unresolved external reference; this
   name was not present when the module was linked.  If this module
   is relinked, the linkage-editor can resolve references to this
   name but its presence is not required.

))PDS442W name (MISSING)
   This external name is an unresolved external reference; this name
   was not present when the module was linked.  If this module is
   relinked, the linkage-editor can resolve references to this name;
   however, error messages will be generated if this name is again
   missing during the module linkage-edit.

))PDS443W MAXBLK HAS BEEN RAISED TO THE DATA SET LRECL VALUE
   REPRO does not allow an output blocksize lower than the data set
   logical record length.  For RECFM=V data sets, MAXBLK is set to
   the LRECL+4; for RECFM=F data sets, MAXBLK is set to the LRECL.

))PDS444W MAXBLK EXCEEDS THE DATA SET BLOCKSIZE
   REPRO can create data blocks larger than your current data set
   blocksize; however, unless the BLKSIZE is changed to the maximum
   data blocksize later, most programs referencing the large blocks
   will fail with I/O errors.

))PDS451W ALL MEMBERS IN THIS PDS WILL BE LOST
   FIXPDS RESET deletes all members from the data set.

))PDS460W NO HISTORY DATA IS AVAILABLE
   This module has no associated history (translator, zap or user-
   supplied) IDR data.  This module was probably linked by an obsolete
   linkage editor.

))PDS470W THE PROGRAM IS PROBABLY IN A LOOP
   The previous attention was noted but an interruption point was
   not encountered in the program before this attention.

   Interruptions are checked for at a terminal input or output and
   when the input data set is read.

   This message usually means that the program is in a loop --
   the looping subcommand will be terminated and the subcommand
   that was last entered will be given control.

))PDS471W operation HAS COMPLETED WITH WARNINGS; RC=nnn ABEND=Snnn Unnnn
   The operation has finished with the indicated
   return code.  This is issued for the following
   subcommands when the return code is non-zero.

))PDS480W COMPRESS IS IN PROGRESS
   A compress has been initiated.

   Compress is performed in-place on your data set; if IEBCOPY does
   not complete its operation for any reason, the data set should be
   checked with a VERIFY subcommand.

  PDS480W COMPRESS MAY NOT BE INTERRUPTED
   Attentions received during a compress operation are ignored since
   the target data set may be destroyed if IEBCOPY does not complete.

))PDS482W BLOCKSIZE SHOULD BE EVENLY DIVISIBLE BY THE DCB LRECL
   The requested BLKSIZE is not a multiple of the logical record
   length.  This is usually an error.

))PDS484W COPY IS IN PROGRESS
   A copy operation has been initiated.

   Selected members from the current data set are being copied to
   the output data set.

  PDS484W COPY SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED
   Attentions received during the copy operation are ignored to
   ensure that the target data set will not be destroyed.

))PDS500W NO COBOL TASK GLOBAL TABLE WAS FOUND
   This member contains COBOL CSECTS; however, the TGT could not be
   located after the member was loaded.  Thus, no compile options
   can be reported.

))PDS502W THIS MODULE WAS COMPILED WITH ENDJOB AND MIXED RES AND NORES
   Some of the COBOL routines in this module were compiled with the
   RES compiler option; others had the NORES option; and ENDJOB was
   in effect for at least one routine.  According to the COBOL
   programmer's guide, this combination is not recommended.

))PDS503W THIS MODULE WAS COMPILED WITH MIXED RES AND NORES
   Some of the COBOL routines in this module were compiled with the
   RES compiler option; others had the NORES option.  This can lead
   to errors since some routines have requested resident compiler
   routines and others have requested no resident compiler routines.

))PDS510W THIS IS A NULL MEMBER
   This member contains no data.

))PDS520W NO INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE
   No .? (extended help) information is available -- no warning or
   error messages are current.

   To use the extended help facility, you should enter  .?
   immediately after any subcommand which receives warning (PDSnnnW)
   and/or error (PDSnnnE) messages.  Up to five of the most recent
   warning or error message explanations will be automatically
   requested from the HELP data set by the program.

   Note: To test the extended help facility when no messages are
   current, enter  .?  twice.  The first enter will result in a
   PDS520W message and the second enter should result in an
   explanation of the PDS520W message.

))PDS521W OUTPUT DATA SET IS NOT PARTITIONED
   The LOAD subcommand which invokes PDSLOAD requires an output
   PDS.

))PDS522W ADDSTATS REQUIRED WITH EXTEND
   The ATTRIB subcommand to add extended ISPF member statistics
   must be issued with both the ADDSTATS and EXTEND operands.

))PDS530W THIS DATA SET IS NOT PARTITIONED
   Several subcommands are not available since they are only defined
   for partitioned data sets.

))PDS531W THIS DATA SET IS A PDSE - SOME FUNCTIONS LIMITED
   Several subcommands are not available because they are not
   allowed by IBM design or they require the Binder API.

   Subcommand       PDSE Type         Reason
   -------------    --------------    --------------------
   RESTORE          Data              IBM design

   ATTRIB lkedattr  Program Object    Binder API
   REPRO            Program Object    Binder API

))PDS532W MULTIPLE INPUT MEMBERS WILL BE UNLOADED TO THIS SEQUENTIAL
  DATA SET
   The output data set is sequential; IEBCOPY will be used to
   create an unload format output data set.

))PDS533W TSO TRANSMIT LIMITED TO 3620 MEMBERS UNLESS ALL MEMBERS
  ARE SPECIFIED
   The member group to be transmitted can not be larger than 3620
   members.  All members (:) can be transmitted without limits.
   This is due to the IKJEFTSR command buffer length limitation
   of 32K.

))PDS534W MATCH DATA SET IS NOT PARTITIONED
   PDSMATCH only works with two partitioned data sets.

))PDS535W THIS DATA SET IS NOT A PDSE
   The VPDSE subcommand is only supported for PDSE data sets.

))PDS700E THIS RANGE OF NAMES IS INVALID
   The range of names indicated is invalid (the range of names may
   not progress from one name to a name lower in collating sequence).

   For example:
       valid name ranges   --  bb:bb   bb:c   bb:bc   bb:b   bb:   :bb
       invalid name ranges --  bb:ba   bb:a

))PDS701E THIS DATA SET IS NOT A LOAD LIBRARY
   This subcommand or operand is only defined for load libraries.

))PDS702E THIS DATA SET IS A LOAD LIBRARY
   This subcommand or operand is not defined for load libraries.

))PDS703E THIS MODULE HAS NO EXTERNAL SYMBOLS
   This usually indicates that the module was not created by a linkage
   editor or that it was constructed from incomplete data or that it
   was created with the not-edit attribute of the linkage editor.

))PDS704E MODULE member HAS NO EXTERNAL SYMBOLS
   This usually indicates that the module was not created by a linkage
   editor or that it was constructed from incomplete data or that it
   was created with the not-edit attribute of the linkage editor.

))PDS705E EXTERNAL SYMBOL name WAS NOT FOUND
   This name is not a valid external symbol in this member and the
   entry point address can not be changed.

))PDS706E THIS DATA SET IS A PDSE
   The RESTORE subcommand is not supported for PDSE data sets.

))PDS707E RENAME SWAP IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PDSE DATA SETS
   The RENAME SWAP operand is not supported for PDSE data sets.

))PDS708E PDS708E EXTENDED/LARGE FORMAT, HFS, AND VSAM ARE NOT SUPPORTED
   Extended/Large Format, HFS, and VSAM datasets are not supported.

))PDS710E INVALID APF INFORMATION FORMAT; MEMBER IS ASSUMED NOT AUTH.
   The APF information for this module is invalid and the module
   is assumed to be not authorized.

))PDS711E NO MEMBER NAMES ARE IN THIS RANGE
   This data set has no members whose names are in this range of names.
   The following examples illustrate matching members for the MEMBER
   subcommand:
        MEMBERS :          all members -- X'00' through X'FF'
        MEMBERS dd:        members from DD... through X'FF'
        MEMBERS :bb        members from X'00' through BB...
        MEMBERS aa:bb      members between AA... and BB...
        MEMBERS (abc,d:)   member ABC and those from D... through X'FF'

))PDS712E NO MEMBER NAMES MATCH THIS PATTERN
   This data set has no members whose names match these pattern
   characters.  The following examples illustrate matching members for
   the MEMBER subcommand:
        MEMBERS aa/        member names containing AA anywhere
        MEMBERS /bb        member names containing BB anywhere
        MEMBERS aa/bb      member names containing AA and BB
        MEMBERS (aa/,bb/)  member names containing AA or BB

))PDS713E NO MEMBER NAMES MATCH THIS COMBINATION NAME
   Either no member names match the beginning range characters or
   the second pattern portion of the name entered.  The following
   examples illustrate matching members for the MEMBER subcommand:
        MEMBERS aa*        members with names AA...
        MEMBERS *bb        members with names containing BB anywhere
        MEMBERS aa*bb      members with names AA... and BB elsewhere
        MEMBERS (aa*,bb/)  members with names AA... or with BB anywhere

))PDS715E NO MATCHING ATTRIBUTES WERE FOUND
   This IF or MEMLIST subcommand did not locate any members with the
   attributes desired in the members searched.

   Note: if IF with THEN(SUBLIST) or ELSE(SUBLIST) was entered, the
   default member group is nullified.  You will have to explicitly
   respecify the member group to establish a new default member group.

))PDS720E NOT APF AUTHORIZED; THE APF DATA IS MISSING
   The APF data for this module is not present and the module is
   assumed to be not authorized.

))PDS721E NOT APF AUTHORIZED, THE APF DATA IS THE WRONG LENGTH
   The APF data for this module is invalid (not one byte long) and
   the module is assumed to be not authorized.

))PDS722E THE APF DATA CAN NOT BE CHANGED
   Due to missing or invalid APF data, the APF value was not modified.
   A module linked with an old linkage editor might not have APF data.

))PDS723E THE RLD/CONTROL COUNT CAN NOT BE CHANGED
   Due to non-existent RLD/control data in the member, the directory
   RLD/control count was not modified.  Note that a module linked with
   an obsolete linkage editor might not have a RLD/control count field.

))PDS724E RMODE AND AMODE CAN NOT BE CHANGED -- OBSOLETE LINKAGE-EDITOR
   Residence and addressing mode values do not exist for this module
   since it was linked with an obsolete linkage editor.

))PDS726E PAGE ALIGNMENT CAN NOT BE CHANGED -- OBSOLETE LINKAGE-EDITOR
   The page alignment flag does not exist for this module since it was
   linked with an obsolete linkage editor.

))PDS730E THIS SUBCOMMAND IS NOT OPERATIONAL; YOU ARE ALREADY UNDER ISPF
   The BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE, MEMLIST, and VIEW subcommands
   cannot be used since ISPF was initialized before invoking -PDS86-.

   Note: if -PDS86- is invoked from the PDS panel, these subcommands
   can be used in -PDS86- even though ISPF is active.

))PDS731E ISPF IS NOT OPERATIONAL NOW
   Due to a previously noted error condition, the BROWSE, EDIT,
   ISPF, ISPMODE, MEMLIST, and VIEW subcommands have been disabled.

))PDS732E CLIST PROCESSING IS NOT SUPPORTED FROM ISPMODE OR MEMLIST
   The % (implied CLIST) and EXEC subcommands are not currently
   operational in an ISPF dialog environment.

))PDS733E BROWSE FAILED -- NULL MEMBER (ZERO-LENGTH DATA)
   ISPF cannot BROWSE null members with no data.

))PDS734E BROWSE FAILED -- NO MEMBERS IN PDS
   ISPF cannot BROWSE a PDS with no members.

))PDS735E BROWSE FAILED -- I/O ERROR
   ISPF cannot BROWSE members containing I/O errors
   (physical errors or logical record blocking errors).

))PDS740E THIS MODULE HAS NO MATCHING EXTERNAL SYMBOLS
   The MODULE(name) requested is not contained in this member.

))PDS750E A REQUIRED NOTELIST POINTER WAS NOT FOUND IN THIS MEMBER
   Due to an error condition, one or more load module records referred
   to in an overlay notelist record could not be located by FIXPDS.

   This message may be due to data set or equipment errors.  A VERIFY
   subcommand may provide more information.

   The EXPANDDIR operation is terminated with the member in error
   unchanged.  Any previously moved members and their associated
   aliases are fully updated, however.

   If this problem is due to data set errors, the data set may be
   damaged and should be recovered.

))PDS751E A NOTELIST RECORD COULD NOT BE FOUND FOR THIS MEMBER
   Due to an error condition, an overlay notelist record could not
   be input by FIXPDS.

   This message may be due to data set or equipment errors.  A VERIFY
   subcommand may provide more information.

   The EXPANDDIR operation is terminated with the member in error
   unchanged.  Any previously moved members and their associated

   This member contains blocks larger than the MAXBLK value entered.

))PDS811E RECORD LENGTH n IS INVALID
   The indicated logical record length (0, 1, 2 or 3) is invalid for
   RECFM(V) data sets.

   This type of error may indicate that your data set DCB has been
   altered.  If this is the case, the data set DCB can be reset
   with the following subcommand:
     FIXPDS RECFM(mm) LRECL(nn) BLKSIZE(pp)
     (where mm, nn and pp are replaced by the proper DCB attributes)

))PDS812E BLOCK LENGTH OF nn,nnn EXCEEDS THE DATA SET DCB BLKSIZE
   The physical blocksize exceeds the BLKSIZE of the data set.

   This type of error may indicate that your data set DCB has been
   altered.  If this is the case, the data set DCB can be reset
   with the following subcommand:
     FIXPDS RECFM(mm) LRECL(nn) BLKSIZE(pp)
     (where mm, nn and pp are replaced by the proper DCB attributes)

))PDS813E RECORD LENGTH OF nn,nnn EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM DCB LRECL
   The logical record length exceeds the LRECL of the data set.

   This type of error may indicate that your data set DCB has been
   altered.  If this is the case, the data set DCB can be reset
   with the following subcommand:
     FIXPDS RECFM(mm) LRECL(nn) BLKSIZE(pp)
     (where mm, nn and pp are replaced by the proper DCB attributes)

))PDS814E BLOCK LENGTH OF nn,nnn IS NOT DIVISIBLE BY THE DCB LRECL
   The physical blocksize is not a multiple of the data set's LRECL.

   This type of error may indicate that your data set DCB has been
   altered.  If this is the case, the data set DCB can be reset
   with the following subcommand:

     (where mm, nn and pp are replaced by the proper DCB attributes)

))PDS820E THIS MEMBER IS AN ALIAS FOR member1 BUT IT POINTS TO member2
   This member is actually an alias for main member member1 (according
   to its TTR), but its directory entry indicates that it should be an
   alias of member2.

   This is usually caused by doing a rename of a main module with
   some utility which does not update the associated alias modules'
   directory entries correctly.

   This type of error could cause serious problems if the members are
   in your LPALIB (you may not be able to IPL).

   To correct this problem with -PDS86-, issue the following
   subcommand:
     RENAME member1 member1
        (where member1 is the name of the main module identified above)

))PDS821E RMODE ENTRY DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH MEMBER member
   The residence mode entry for this alias member does not match the
   residence mode entry of the identified main module.

   This type of error is unusual; the main module and its aliases
   should be reinstalled.

   To correct this problem with -PDS86-, issue the following
   subcommands:
     ATTRIB member
        (where member is the main member identified above).
     ATTRIB member RMODExx
        (where RMODExx is the RMODE value displayed
         by the above ATTRIB subcommand)

))PDS822E MAIN AMODE ENTRY DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH MEMBER member
   The addressing mode entry for this alias member does not match
   the addressing mode entry of the identified main module.

   This type of error is unusual; the main module and its aliases
   should be reinstalled.

   To correct this problem with -PDS86-, issue the following
   subcommands:
     ATTRIB member
        (where member is the main member identified above).
     ATTRIB member AMODExx
        (where AMODExx is the AMODE value displayed
         by the above ATTRIB subcommand)

))PDS823E RLD/CONTROL COUNT DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH MEMBER member
   The RLD/control count for this alias member does not match
   the RLD/control count of the identified main module.

   This type of error is unusual; the main module and its aliases
   should be reinstalled.

   This count field is used by program fetch to construct
   a channel program that will load the member.

   If this error is not resolved before program fetch uses this member,
   fetch may operate in a degraded mode (see message CSV300I).

   To correct this problem with -PDS86-, issue the following
   subcommand for the main module and each of its aliases:
     ATTRIB memberx RLDFIX

))PDS824E DUPLICATE MEMBER NAME -- IGNORED
   This member name has previously been encountered in the data set
   directory.

   Your data set has been damaged -- it should be recovered in some
   fashion; it may suffice to just delete one of the duplicate member
   names.  Note: an interactive ZAP command may be useful here in
   changing the actual member names to ascending order.

))PDS825E MEMBER NAME IS OUT OF SEQUENCE -- IGNORED
   Member names higher in the collating sequence than this member name
   have previously been encountered in the data set directory.

   Your data set has been damaged -- it should be recovered in some
   fashion; it may suffice to delete the out-of-sequence member
   name or the member name just before this one in the directory.
   Note: an interactive ZAP command may be useful in changing the
   actual member names to ascending order.

))PDS826E THE DIRECTORY RLD/CONTROL COUNT DOES NOT MATCH THE FIRST RLD
   ENTRY
   The RLD/control count for this member does not match the number
   of RLD or control records following the first TEXT record.

   This count field is used by program fetch to construct
   a channel program that will load the member.

   If this error is not resolved before program fetch uses this member,
   fetch may operate in a degraded mode (see message CSV300I).

   To correct this problem with -PDS86-, issue the following
   subcommand for the main module and each of its aliases:
     ATTRIB memberx RLDFIX

))PDS827E member1 IS AN ALIAS FOR THIS MEMBER BUT IT POINTS TO member2
   Member1 is actually an alias for this main member (according to its
   TTR), but its directory entry indicates that it should be an alias
   of member2.

   This is usually caused by doing a rename of a main module with
   some utility which does not update the associated alias modules'
   directory entries correctly.

   This type of error could cause serious problems if the members are
   in your LPALIB (you may not be able to IPL).

   To correct this problem with -PDS86-, issue the following

        (where mmember is the name of the main member)

))PDS830E OBTAIN ERROR; DSCB NOT ON VOLUME
   The data set name could not be found in the VTOC (Volume Table of
   Contents); this is probably a program error or the base name
   of a generation data group (GDG) has been entered.

))PDS831E UNABLE TO OPEN DATA SET
   The open for the input data set failed; this is probably a
   program error.

))PDS832E DUMMY MEMBER ADD FAILED, RC=8
   A dummy member, with name 9FIXPDS, was not added as expected to
   the data set directory; this is probably a program error.

))PDS833E DUMMY MEMBER DELETE FAILED, RC=8
   A dummy member, with name 9FIXPDS, was not deleted as expected from
   the data set directory; this is probably a program error.

))PDS834E ERROR IN GNRLFAIL SERVICE ROUTINE; R15=nn
   The GNRLFAIL system message routine failed with the indicated
   return code; this is probably a program error.

))PDS835E ERROR IN DAIRFAIL SERVICE ROUTINE; R15=nn
   The DAIRFAIL system message routine failed with the indicated return
   code; this is probably a program error.

))PDS836E I/O ERROR IN DIRECTORY
   The system directory management routines indicate that the directory
   for this data set contains one or more I/O errors.

   This I/O error may be due to data set or equipment errors; entering
   a VERIFY subcommand may provide more information.

   Data set recovery will be required if this is a data set error.

))PDS840E INVALID HEXADECIMAL STRING LENGTH
   At most 64 hexadecimal digits may be used for a search or
   replacement string.

))PDS841E INVALID HEXADECIMAL CHARACTERS

   used in hexadecimal strings.

))PDS842E THIS STRING IS TOO LONG
   At most 32 characters may be used for a search or replacement
   string.

))PDS843E ONLY DISK DATA SETS ARE SUPPORTED
   The target data set must exist on a physical or virtual disk.

))PDS844E LOCATE FAILED FOR DATA SET dsname
   The input or output dsname must be cataloged.

   This member is being modified by the named user or JOB; this member
   is currently owned by the indicated user or JOB and its status can
   not be changed.

))PDS851E THIS DATA SET IS BEING UPDATED BY username
   This data set is being modified by the named user or JOB; this data
   set is currently owned by the indicated user or JOB and its status
   can not be changed.

))PDS852E member ALREADY EXISTS
   This member cannot be added to the data set; this member name is
   already in the data set.

))PDS853E MEMBER member NOT FOUND
   This member is not in the data set.

))PDS854E member IS AN INVALID MEMBER NAME
   This member name is invalid; member names may be entered in either
   character or hexadecimal mode.

   Character member names may be from one to eight bytes long with no
   imbedded blanks, commas, parentheses, colons or slashes.

   Hexadecimal member names may contain from one to sixteen hexadecimal
   digits delimited by x' and '.  Note: x'd7c4e2f9' and PDS9 are
   entirely equivalent; also, x'333' and x'0333' are equivalent.

))PDS855E THE DATA SET DIRECTORY IS FULL AND MEMBERS CANNOT BE ADDED
   The directory is full; if you are currently trying to save a member
   using an editor, you may wish to save it in another data set.
   This message can also be issued if trying to add ISPF statistics
   to a member.

   This type of problem can be resolved in several ways:
     1.  clean up the directory of the data set by deleting obsolete
         members and make room for new member names.
     2.  split the data set into two (or more) data sets.
     3.  reallocate the data set (with a larger directory) and copy
         all old members to the replacement data set.
     4.  expand the directory with FIXPDS.  For example, enter
         FIXPDS EXPAND(30)  to add 30 directory blocks.

))PDS856E STOW ERROR, R15=nn, R0=hexvalue

))PDS858E NO DEFAULT MEMBER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
   A command such as  MEMBERS *  may only be entered after a default
   member name or member group has been established.  To establish a
   default member name or member group, you could use any of the
   following example statements:
        MEMBERS abc        member ABC
        MEMBERS (abc,xyz)  members ABC and XYZ
        MEMBERS :          all members -- X'00' through X'FF'
        MEMBERS dd:        members from DD... through X'FF'
        MEMBERS :bb        members from X'00' through BB...
        MEMBERS aa:bb      members between AA... and BB...
        MEMBERS (abc,d:)   member ABC and those from D... through X'FF'
        MEMBERS aa/        member names containing AA anywhere
        MEMBERS /bb        member names containing BB anywhere
        MEMBERS aa/bb      member names containing AA and BB
        MEMBERS (aa/,bb/)  member names containing AA or BB
        MEMBERS aa*        members with names AA...
        MEMBERS *bb        members with names containing BB anywhere
        MEMBERS aa*bb      members with names AA... and BB elsewhere
        MEMBERS (aa*,bb/)  members with names AA... or with BB anywhere

   Note: after a command such as one of the above has been entered,
   the following example statement refers to the default member name
   or member group:
        MEMBERS *          members in the default member name or group

   You can determine if a member group is current by examining the
   normal -PDS86- prompt message (PDS300A).  If MEM= is followed by
   a blank, no default member group has been established.

))PDS859E COMMAND name WAS NOT FOUND
   The named TSO command is required to support a PDS subcommand but it
   could not be found in the LINKLIST, your STEPLIB/ISPLLIB dataset or
   in the LPALIB.  Ensure that the required TSO command is available
   from one of the above sources before trying this subcommand again.

   This message can also be issued if a program being executed by
   -PDS86- via IKJEFTSR is not found in the MVS load module search
   path.  Examples of these programs are listed below.

   AMBLIST     ASMDASM     CPKMAP      COBANAL     DELINKI     DISASM
   DISKMAP     EQALMA      FDRCPK      GIMCPTS     IEBCOPY     IEBPDSE

))PDS860E MEMBER IS AN ALIAS BUT NO MAIN MEMBER EXISTS
   This alias member has no associated main member.  This type of
   alias member is termed an orphan.

   This type of error is usually caused by not linking a main module
   and all of its aliases; the main module and its aliases should be
   reinstalled.

   To correct this problem with -PDS86-, issue the following
   subcommands for each identified orphan member:
     DELETE memberz
        (where memberz is the orphan member)
     ALIAS memberx memberz
        (where memberx is the correct main member)

))PDS861E THE ALIAS DIRECTORY ENTRY NOTES THE MAIN MEMBER NAME AS membr
   This message displays the name of the main member for this alias
   member as noted by its directory entry.

))PDS862E ERROR IN GQSCAN DATA
   This message indicates that ENQUEUE check parameters are incorrect;
   this is probably a program error.

))PDS864E member IS AN APPARENT ALIAS FOR THIS MEMBER
   This member and the identified member both point to the same TTR
   address but neither has its alias bit set.

   These members are called apparent aliases and the actual owner
   of the member data can not be determined.

   One cause of this type of problem is an open/close/EOV situation
   (OZ44857 -- also documented in II00587) in which opening a
   partitioned data set causes the FORMAT1 DSCB to be rewritten; If
   this occurs while the data set is open for update or output, then
   the DS1LSTAR (last TTR pointer) can be invalidated.

   Normally, this situation should only occur on the first access of
   each day; however, some user modifications cause the DSCB to be
   updated more often and increase the exposure for duplicate TTR's
   and overlaid members.

   If the data set is copied or compressed, IEBCOPY will hide this
   error by creating two identical members during the copy.

   To correct this problem with -PDS86-, determine which apparent
   alias member name should correspond to the member data and issue
   the following subcommand:
     DELETE memberx
        (where memberx is the non-corresponding alias name)

))PDS865E THE IEBCOPY OUTPUT CAN NOT BE OPENED
   A compress or copy has been performed but a summary of IEBCOPY's
   messages cannot be provided since the message data set can not be
   opened.

   This is probably a program error.

))PDS870E PDS DIRECTORIES MUST BE CONTAINED IN ONE EXTENT
   The directory of a partitioned data set must be totally contained in
   the first extent of the data set.

   From VERIFY, it indicates that your data set was allocated with a
   invalid directory and the data set should not be used as it may
   fail in program load or when used by IEBCOPY.

   From FIXPDS, it indicates that your data set will require more than
   its first extent to contain the expanded (or reset) directory.
   This is not permitted as it would create an invalid data set
   directory.

))PDS871E A TTR FOR THIS MEMBER WAS NOT FOUND
   Due to an error condition, a record pointed by this member's
   directory entry could not be found in this load module.

   This message may be due to data set or equipment errors.  A VERIFY
   subcommand may provide more information.

   If this error occurs in FIXPDS, the subcommand is terminated before
   changing the member in error.  Any previously moved members and
   their associated aliases are fully updated, however.

   If this problem is due to data set errors, the data set may be
   damaged and should be recovered.

))PDS872E THIS MEMBER IS AFTER THE DATA SET END-OF-FILE
   This member's data follows the end of data set marker (DS1LSTAR)
   for this data set.  To ensure that this diagnostic message is
   valid, -PDS86- reopens the data set from the EXCP routine in case
   another user has saved into the data set.

   This message indicates that your data set contains one or more
   invalid TTR pointers and that the data set has been damaged;
   the data set should be recovered in some fashion.

))PDS873E TTR IS BEYOND THE USED PORTION OF THE DATA SET
   A TTR pointer in this member's directory has a value which exceeds
   the end of data marker for the data set.

   This type of error is unusual; it indicates that your data set
   contains one or more invalid TTR pointers and that the data set has
   been damaged -- the data set should be recovered in some fashion.

))PDS874E TSO COMMAND NAME IS INVALID
   TSO SCAN service indicates that this TSO command name is invalid.

   Valid TSO command names follow these rules:
     1.  The TSO command name should be from one to eight bytes long.
     2.  The first character of the TSO command name must be a
         alphabetic or national character.
     3.  Any additional characters should be alphabetic, numeric
         or national characters.

))PDS875E THIS DATA SET HAS NO DIRECTORY BLOCKS
   This is a null data set -- it contains no tracks and consequently,
   no directory blocks and no members.

   When the data set takes an extent, it will receive actual disk
   tracks and directory blocks.

))PDS876E A DIRECTORY RECORD HAS AN INCORRECT LENGTH (NOT 256 BYTES)
   This data set has an invalid directory block.  Directory blocks
   should be 256 characters long and each block should contain an
   eight byte key.

   This type of error usually indicates that your data set has been
   written over and the data set should be recovered in some fashion.

))PDS877E INVALID SUBCOMMAND NAME
   TSO SCAN service indicates that this subcommand name is invalid.

   Valid subcommand names follow these rules:
     1.  The subcommand name should be from one to eight bytes long.
     2.  The first character of the subcommand name must be a
         alphabetic or national character.
     3.  Any additional characters should be alphabetic, numeric
         or national characters.

))PDS879E RESIDENCE MODE 64 AND ADDRESSING MODE xxx ARE INCOMPATIBLE
   Residence mode 64 and an addressing mode of either 24, 31, or ANY
   are incompatible; this is an invalid combination of linkage editor
   attributes.

))PDS880E RESIDENCE MODE ANY AND ADDRESSING MODE xxx ARE INCOMPATIBLE
   Residence mode ANY and an addressing mode of either 24 or ANY are
   incompatible; this is an invalid combination of linkage editor
   attributes.

))PDS881E REENTRANT ATTRIBUTE CONFLICTS WITH NOT REUSABLE
   A reentrant attribute is incompatible with a not reusable attribute;
   this is an invalid combination of linkage editor attributes.

))PDS882E TEST ATTRIBUTE CONFLICTS WITH NOT EDIT
   A TEST attribute is incompatible with a NOT EDIT attribute;
   this is an invalid combination of linkage editor attributes.

))PDS883E REUSABLE ATTRIBUTE CONFLICTS WITH SCATTER
   A reusable attribute is incompatible with a scatter load attribute;
   this is an invalid combination of linkage editor attributes.

))PDS884E OVERLAY ATTRIBUTE CONFLICTS WITH xxx
   This message documents an incompatible combination of the overlay
   attribute and another linkage editor attribute as follows:
     1.  Overlay and reentrant are incompatible.
     2.  Overlay and reusable are incompatible.
     3.  Overlay and scatter load are incompatible.
     4.  Overlay and RMODE ANY are incompatible.
     5.  Overlay and AMODE 31 are incompatible.
     6.  Overlay and AMODE 64 are incompatible.
     7.  Overlay and AMODE ANY are incompatible.

))PDS885E MORE THAN ONE OUTPUT MEMBER WOULD BE NAMED memname
   For a COPY or REPRO operation with the AS or TO keyword, multiple
   members can map to the same output member name.

   For example, if the member names A03BY, BONBY and CONCY are input
   and AS(ZZZ) is in effect, only the output member names ZZZBY and
   ZZZCY would result.

))PDS892E READ MULTIPLE FAILED AT TTR=ttttrr
   -PDS86- has an input mode called "read multiple" which can read
   an entire track of disk data at a time.  A read multiple can fail
   for any of several reasons:
     I/O error     - an I/O error is on the current track
     Invalid addr  - the disk TTR address provided is invalid
     Not capable   - the device can not perform a read multiple CCW
     Track overrun - too much data is recorded on a physical track

   After read multiple fails, -PDS86- uses its alternate double
   buffering input mode for the remainder of the subcommand.  With
   the next subcommand, read multiple is attempted again.

   If many subcommands issue failure messages for read multiple,
   consider changing the mode for input buffering to double with
   the following subcommand:
     CONTROL DOUBLE

))PDS893E READ MULTIPLE ERROR -- NEXT TTR (ttttrr) IS INCORRECT
   -PDS86- has an input mode called "read multiple" which can read
   an entire track of disk data at a time.  The last read command
   failed to obtain a new TTR address for the next track even though
   no error condition was presented to the program.

   After read multiple fails, -PDS86- uses its alternate double
   buffering input mode for the remainder of the subcommand.  With
   the next subcommand, read multiple is attempted again.

   If many subcommands issue failure messages for read multiple,
   consider changing the mode for input buffering to double with
   the following subcommand:
     CONTROL DOUBLE

   This error is probably due to equipment errors; notify your
   hardware vendor of a possible problem with DASD "read multiple"
   on the device currently allocated.

   For STC 8880 controllers, ensure that EC 63096 is applied; for STC
   8890 cache controllers, ensure that EC 62974 is applied.

))PDS900E THE SOURCE AND TARGET DATA SETS MUST DIFFER
   The copy programs supported do not allow you to copy members
   into the input data set;  when the input and output data sets
   are identical, a data set compress would be attempted.

   You can perform this type of function with the REPRO subcommand
   by using the AS or TO keyword.

))PDS910E TSO COMMAND name IS NOT ALLOWED
   You are not authorized to use this TSO command.  Contact your
   systems support staff if this restriction causes a problem.

))PDS920E SUBCOMMAND name IS NOT ALLOWED FOR THIS DATA SET
   You are not authorized to use this subcommand.  Contact your
   systems support staff if this restriction causes a problem.

))PDS930E name IS AN INVALID SUBCOMMAND ABBREVIATION
   This subcommand name is not allowed.  You must enter additional
   characters to create a valid subcommand name.

))PDS932E OLD ALLOCATION IS REQUIRED FOR THIS FUNCTION
   For a PDSE data set, FIXPDS RESET requires OLD allocation.  This
   function uses a STOW DCB,,I form to reinitialize the data set.

   If you can not get OLD allocation to this data set, you can also
   delete all members by entering  DELETE :

   Note: Global variable &STOWI default is 'YES' which indicates
         APAR OA13224 "DISP=SHR FOR STOW INIT" is on the system.

))PDS973E NO DEFAULT OUTPUT DATA SET NAME HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
   The default output data set name for the COPY subcommand has not
   yet been established.  Until a COPY command is entered with an
   actual data set name as output, the * notation for the default
   output data set name may not be used.

))PDS980E IEBCOPY WAS INTERRUPTED
   A compress or copy operation has been interrupted by an attention
   or ABEND.

   For a copy operation, this usually means that the output was only
   partially completed; for a compress operation, note the following:

   Compress is performed in-place on your data set; since IEBCOPY did
   not complete its operation, the data set may be destroyed.

   Attentions received during a compress operation cannot be ignored
   as IKJEFTSR is being used to gain authorization for IEBCOPY.

   It is suggested that you do not press the attention key during a
   compress or that you use some other method of gaining authorization;
   contact your system support staff for more information.

))PDS982E SEQUENTIAL INPUT MUST BE COPIED TO A SPECIFIC OUTPUT MEMBER
   Sequential input must be copied to a single output member; use
   syntax such as the following: PDS.DATA(membername).

))PDS983E MAXGENS VALUE IS > 2,000,000,000
   The MAXGENS value has exceeded the largest allowed value.

))PDS984E MAXGENS VALUE EXCEEDS THE SMS LIMIT
   The MAXGENS value has exceeded the SMS MAXGENS_LIMIT.

))PDS990E EXTENT INITIALIZATION READ FAILED
   The first read for an extent of this data set failed.  This type
   of problem is unusual unless your directory contains invalid TTR
   pointers.

))PDS991E PERMANENT I/O ERROR AT TTR=hexttr
   An uncorrectable I/O error was encountered at the displayed TTR
   address.

   This error may be due to data set or equipment errors.  A VERIFY
   subcommand may provide more information.

   Data set recovery will be required if this is a data set error.

))PDS993E jobname,stepname,ucb,D,ddname,READ/WRITE,error message,
  hexbbcchhr,BPAM S
  hexttr,relrec#num,smsretur,smsreasn

   An uncorrectable I/O error was encountered at the displayed disk
   address.  The error message is generated by a SYNAD recovery
   routine for PDSE datasets.

   In this message, data will be filled in as follows:
     ucb             is the UCB address of the active device
     D               means direct access
     ddname          is the DDNAME of the data set
     READ/WRITE      is the function being performed
     error message   is a short description of the problem encountered
     hexbbcchhr      is the actual address of the error in hexadecimal
     BPAM S          indicates the data set was a PDSE
     hexttr          is the TTR (token address) of the member in error.
     relrec#num      is the relative record number of the error.  Note:
                     add 1,048,576 to get the actual TTR of the record.
     smsretur        is the SMS return code.
     smsreasn        is the SMS reason code.

))PDS996E subcommand IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PROGRAM OBJECTS
   The following subcommands and functions are not yet supported for
   program objects (load members in PDSE data sets):
     ALIAS   -  assign an alias to a program object.
     ATTRIB  -  update module attributes; ATTRIB can display
                attributes of program objects, however.
     REPLACE -  update a program object.
     REPRO   -  reproduce a program object.

))PDS997E DIFFERENT VERSION OF PDS REINVOKED
   When ISPF services are requested within PDS and it has been
   invoked outside of ISPF (i.e. "READY" mode), PDS reinvokes itself
   recursively as an ISPF dialog to use ISPF services.

   This error indicates that a different version of -PDS86- was
   entered on the recursive entry.  This can happen if you invoke
   -PDS86- from either LINKLIST, LPALIB or STEPLIB and you have
   a different copy of -PDS86- in your ISPLLIB data set.

   This error is detected by comparing the assembly date and time of
   the calling version of PDS with the corresponding values from the
   invoked version of PDS.

))PDS998E ABEND Sxxx LOADING THIS MODULE
   The displayed ABEND code was received while loading this module.

   If you have your user profile set to WTPMSG as in the TSO command,
   PROFILE WTPMSG, you should have also first received an IEA703I

   Explanation:  COPYMOD has been specified. The member is a load module
   which has been copied to the output data set with no change in block
   size or content. The link edit attributes of the member make it
   ineligible for processing by COPYMOD.

   In the message text:
