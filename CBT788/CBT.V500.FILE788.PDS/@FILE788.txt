//***FILE 788 is from Craig Schneiderwent and contains the MA1K     *   FILE 788
//*           application for MQ Series, which was authored by      *   FILE 788
//*           him.  This application used to be distributed on      *   FILE 788
//*           an IBM website, but it is now distributed here.       *   FILE 788

//*    This pds contains three files.  The first is source and      *   FILE 788

//*    This supportpac used to be hosted by IBM on their            *   FILE 788
//*    website, but changes to IBM's "agreement" document           *   FILE 788
//*    governing such hosting necessitated its removal.  The        *   FILE 788
//*    MA1KSRC and MA1KCPY files are XMITted PDSs that were         *   FILE 788
//*    FTP'd in binary.  The last file is MA1KDOC which has         *   FILE 788

//*    Applications that are triggered can call this subroutine     *   FILE 788

//*    queue has no MQCA-BACKOUT-REQ-Q-NAME the poison message      *   FILE 788
//*    will be discarded.                                           *   FILE 788
