/* This header file is to be used by client C programs that want to use
 the traditional POSIX compliant CALL sequences, yet to get PCRE2
 functionality.  Non-C programs that want to achieve the same effect
 may either call the PCRE2 routine names directly or create an API
 module that wrap the PCRE2 names with the traditional namea. Be aware
 though that the latter solution may cause undue conflicts in 'bind'
 time.
 I've decided to change the POSIX API compliant PCRE2 functions to
 prevent such conflict, but by doing so I eliminated the simple
 traditional call sequnce.  This header restores the simple traditional
 call sequence for C programs, but the API for other languages is not
 yet available and is in low priority.
 I will try to provide such an API and full, less confusing
 documentation of the issue in a subsequent release of PCRE2 for z/OS
 This is the second version attempt.  It provides both the #pragma map
 directives and the decision whether to use them (and the accompanied
 headers, or the posix standard header, in one package.  It replaces
 the PC2PSXPG.h and makes it obsolete.
